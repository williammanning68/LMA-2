I couldn't help but notice him as soon as I walked into the crowded nightclub. He was sitting at the bar, sipping on a drink and looking utterly unassuming in his black leather jacket and tight-fitting jeans. But it was what he was wearing underneath that caught my attention - a bright pink mini skirt that seemed out of place among the sea of dark clothing.

My heart began to race as I found myself drawn to him, wondering who this brave soul was and why they were willing to take such a risk by dressing like that in public. I couldn't help but sneak glances at him throughout the night, admiring his confidence and poise.

As the evening wore on, I mustered up the courage to approach him, my legs trembling slightly as I made my way over to the bar. "Mind if I join you?" I asked, trying to sound casual despite the butterflies in my stomach.

He looked up at me with a hint of surprise, but then broke into a warm smile. "Not at all," he replied, his voice low and smooth. "I'm Max."

We chatted for hours, getting to know each other and laughing together like old friends. But as we talked, I couldn't help but notice the way Max's pants were hugging his thighs, accentuating a tight bulge that seemed to be growing thicker by the minute.

It wasn't until he stood up to grab another drink that I realized what was going on. As he moved, his thong slipped lower on his hips, revealing a tantalizing flash of skin. My heart skipped a beat as I caught sight of it - the elastic between his cheeks was stretched taut, and for a moment, I could have sworn I saw an erection rising to the surface.

I felt a flush rise to my cheeks as Max returned to our table, oblivious to what he had just revealed. But as we talked some more, I found myself becoming increasingly turned on by him - not just because of his bold fashion sense, but because of the confidence and vulnerability that seemed to emanate from him like a aura.

Eventually, we decided to leave the club together, walking out into the cool night air side by side. As we strolled through the quiet streets, I found myself feeling more and more at ease with Max, my initial nervousness giving way to a sense of excitement and possibility.

It wasn't until we reached his apartment building that he turned to me and smiled - a mischievous glint in his eye. "Want to see something?" he asked, his voice low and husky.

My heart was racing as I nodded eagerly, my curiosity getting the better of me. As he opened the door and led me inside, I had no idea what lay ahead - but I was ready for whatever came next.
