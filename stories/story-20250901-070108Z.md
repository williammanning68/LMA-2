The Memory Weaver


In the village of Luminaria, an old woman wove tapestries from forgotten memories. Each thread told a tale of love and loss, joy and sorrow. As she worked, her fingers danced with the past, weaving moments into fabric that shimmered like moonlight. The villagers would visit, entranced by the memories they'd never known.
