STATEMENT BY SPEAKER

The SPEAKER - Before I give the call to the Leader of Government Business, I want to make a statement to the House in relation to respectful debate, particularly referring to other members by their correct parliamentary titles.

As stated in the House of Assembly Members' Guide to Procedure, page 33, other members should be referred to as 'the honourable member' for the respective electorate and their title and surname, or you can say 'the honourable the Premier' or 'the honourable minister' for the respective portfolio. More simply, 'the honourable member/minister' during any interchange.

I appreciate the House's cooperation in ensuring respectful debate in the Chamber.

Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, first of all, it's my first time on my feet in this parliament. I congratulate you on being elected Speaker and I'm looking forward to seeing you command authority over this Chamber. Also to thank the Leader of Government Business, the Leader of Greens Business, and the Independents as well, for what's been a very collaborative negotiating period to agree on new Sessional and Standing Orders. I think we've landed on something that's very fair across the parliament, reflects the numbers of each party, and will set us up, hopefully, for a very healthy parliament.

I did foreshadow with the Leader of Government Business, though, that we would move an amendment. I will circulate that now and share it with the other parties. The amendment seeks to reintroduce the vote on the adjournment. I will just read that into Hansard now. I move -

That under the heading 'Sessional Orders', after paragraph (1), insert the following - there will be a renumbering - in Standing Order 18: 

Leave out paragraph (e) and insert instead:

After these issues have been debated for a maximum period of one hour, the Speaker shall put the question that the House do now adjourn. If the question is resolved in the affirmative, the House shall stand adjourned until the next sitting day. If the question is resolved in the negative, the House shall continue with the order of business in accordance with Standing Order 40, and

In the event that a motion for adjournment has been proposed in accordance with paragraph (a) or moved in accordance with paragraph (c) and negatived, and a subsequent motion moved, that the House do now adjourn. This question shall be put without debate.

I understand that by not including this in our negotiations on the Sessional Orders, we're reverting to the original Standing Order, which has been accepted by previous iterations of our parliament. I do want to reflect on the reasons why our last parliament did have a Sessional Order to vote on the adjournment. That was because of the really extraordinary actions of one minister, who decided to shut down the business of the day in a selfish move which was really unnecessary and showed an incredible disrespect and disregard for the parliament.

Not only did that minister shut down the business of the day, shut down the opportunity for the opposition and crossbench to ask questions and scrutinise the government, not only shut down the ability for the government to proceed with any other government business of the day, but members who were here at that time might recall that there was also a planned condolence motion for the late Fran Bladel planned for that day. Her family was ready and waiting to see the parliament pay their respects to Fran, so that was an appalling act of selfishness by one minister, Speaker, who decided, through his own motivations - who knows what they were - just to shut down the business of this parliament.

It shouldn't just be the executive that controls what happens in this place. The last election absolutely shows us that. It shows us that the Tasmanian people want to see us behaving differently in this place. One way for the government to show goodwill about that is to retain this Sessional Order. While it might sound very technical, what it in fact will do is show the Tasmanian people that it's the Chamber, it's this parliament that should have the control over when this House ceases its business for the day.

It was really hurtful that day, particularly because the parliament was dealing with some very sensitive matters, members might remember, but also, of course, that the condolence motion was planned for the lovely Fran Bladel.

I'd be interested to hear some of the arguments for why the government wants to revert to our old Standing Orders and not have the ability for the parliament to be able to keep within its control what happens in this place. I believe it would be a very important gesture and show of goodwill to the expanded crossbench and to the opposition to retain this Sessional Order. With that, I will conclude my comments on the amendment. I don't have anything else to contribute on the substantive motion. Other than this change we are very happy with the negotiated outcome on the Standing and Sessional Orders.

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of Government Business) - Honourable Speaker, first of all, I echo the comments of the new Leader of Opposition Business and wish her well. I look forward to cooperation and thank all those who were involved in the negotiation of six-and-a-half-pages of changes to our Sessional and Standing Orders. I think it is indicative that after all those negotiations, there seems to be only one issue that we are debating. I thank everybody for their cooperation and work in that regard, and especially the staff behind us who have done a lot of work in that regard. 

In relation to the Adjournment issue that the Leader of the Opposition Business has raised, as a government we are very mindful of the fact that we are in a minority. Should a minister or the government seek to do that which you raised - some old history before my time - then I think the numbers in this parliament would express a particular view on that, and therefore -

Mr Winter - No. The parliament never sat again.

Mr ABETZ - it would be on the next sitting day, former leader of the opposition, that the parliament would undoubtedly express a very dim view in relation to that.

Mr Winter - You called an early election.

Mr ABETZ - I will seek to behave myself, Speaker, but the interjections from the former leader of the opposition and my friend from Franklin - I would invite you to desist.

What happens is that if the motion for Adjournment is opposed by a majority in this place, then the parliament would need to continue sitting. I think for the orderly conduct of business, which we are seeking to do to the very best of our ability - no stunts, no surprises in relation to these matters, so that there is an orderly conduct of the parliament.

If the opposition amendment were successful, we would then have the possibility of, at the end of the day when everybody was ready to go and leave, all of a sudden being confronted with having to sit for - and the Clerk might be able to assist me - at least another 90 minutes.

A member - Thirty-five.

Mr ABETZ - Until another motion to adjourn - which would then have us sitting indefinitely. I don't think that is a good workplace practice. I would have thought that those who always talk about good workplace practices would like this motion to ensure that there was certainty to the day for the workers in this place - not only us as members of parliament, might I add, but all the men and women behind these walls who do so much work for us and for the community, and indeed the parliamentary staff as well.

I would respectfully say to the Leader of Opposition Business: understand that there was an unfortunate incident a few years ago. Let's move on. Let's get this collaboration happening, which has occurred in six-and-a-half pages, and let's keep the six-and-a-half pages together.

[10.11 a.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I echo the acknowledgement of the work that has been done to come to this place with these Standing and Sessional Orders. I want to pay a particular mention to staff. Mr Street in the government's corner did a power of work with the crossbench, and I'm sure the opposition, in getting to this position. On our behalf, Ms Giblin, our chief of staff, also did a lot of work and helped get to this position. The Clerks gave great advice and I acknowledge everyone in the House who has made a contribution to this.

I'm going to make a contribution to the motion as a whole and then finish in relation to Labor's amendment. I only take to my feet once in this debate. In terms of the Standing Orders, tweaking the Sessional Orders has been a bit of a work in progress for the parliament and we have gone from 25 members to 35 members. That precipitates the need for a whole raft of different changes so that we all get a fair go. It is great to see that there's an increased representation in the crossbench as well and that needs to be acknowledged and accommodated. It is time to embed some of the previous Sessional Orders, the speaking times and that sort of thing, into the Standing Orders, so we really welcome that. 

One thing that has been lost in the Standing Orders that I want to put on the table and acknowledge is the library committee. There have been some concerns raised by Ms Burnet, my colleague from Clark, about the library committee. We thought that maybe its work could be picked up by the House committee, but we are advised by the Clerks that that is not possible. There has been a commitment from government to talk about this further and work out how we make sure that the library and its research functions are not forgotten because they are really important. As I understand it, we can either reinstate that committee - which I know hasn't met much - or we can find some other place for it to do its work. I put it on the table here and now that we don't want to see the library and the research of the library forgotten in the context of our oversight and input.

In terms of the Sessional Orders, we welcome the fact that there's now 90 minutes for all crossbench members. This is really welcome. There's no reason why the crossbench doesn't deserve the same as the rest of us. We think 20 minutes for the mover and 10 minutes for other contributors is a really appropriate amount of time. If we cannot make our points in 20 minutes as a mover and 10 minutes as a debater then we probably shouldn't be in here. Also, five minutes to quarantine so that we can sum up is very welcome because we did have situations in the last parliament where the time was debated out and the mover of the motion didn't have time to respond. We feel that is really important.

The provision to extend the time of the House to deal with private members' business on Wednesday evenings is also in there and we welcome that commitment by government. We don't want our bills or our business filibustered out and that provision gives us some security that we can have a full three-hour debate on a bill if it is needed and then go to a vote, so that is really welcome.

We also acknowledge an offer - I think - from the government that has been put about potentially forgoing some government business time for more substantial bills at the discretion of the Premier, as we understand it - 'write to the Premier and seek that opportunity' - so we will certainly be judicious with our assessment as to when we need to do that. We acknowledge the Premier's offer for that time and I'm sure we'll take him up on it at some point.

Regarding questions and answers, there are no Dorothy Dixers, there are constituent questions, there are supplementary questions as well and there are ministers, including from the upper House, answering. That is really welcome. 

We support the move to suspend Standing Orders with a simple majority, but people want more stability in this place and having a stable parliament that works involves trust on all sides, so we believe that suspending Standing Orders is an important mechanism to have a 50 per cent majority. It holds government to account, it means we can bring forward urgent business and it shouldn't be needed if things go really well, apart from procedural issues. These Sessional Orders represent an improvement on past Sessional Orders and we welcome them. 

When it comes to the Leader of Opposition Business's amendment, I will flag right now that we won't support it; we support going back to the original Standing Orders. When it was debated before, there was speculation that it was effectively a no-confidence motion in the government and we all know that's a dangerous thing. We know constitutional experts were debating the fact that if the government loses a vote in relation to the House, it is effectively a no-confidence motion.

We all know now that there are mechanisms to prosecute no confidence in the government. If someone has no confidence in the government, they are welcome to put something on the table if they are deliberate and transparent about that with the Tasmanian people. We think that's a more appropriate way to deal with those concerns and avoid potential ramifications of a vote in relation to the Adjournment. Of course, as the Leader of Government Business has said, if the spirit of this Sessional Order is not upheld, if it is abused, then 18 of us can come in here at any time and impose it in future. 

In the spirit of collaboration, we're willing to give the government a go. They've made strong commitments to honouring this provision. There was a late amendment put in just this morning in relation to making sure that a government can't just end business during private members' business and it was very welcome that that was picked up and put in straight away, but we don't want a situation where we sleepwalk into a constitutional issue where there are avenues for no confidence and they're the way to actually put it on the table. We don't support the amendment.

Opposition members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, all members of the Opposition. You can make a contribution yourselves. I do ask the honourable member on his feet be heard.

Mr BAYLEY - With that, honourable Speaker, we don't support the amendment. We support the Standing Orders motion and the Sessional Orders as moved, and I remind the government about that issue in terms of the library committee.

[10.18 a.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, congratulations on your position. This is my first opportunity on my feet, so let's see how the operation of parliament goes in this session, but I just can't let a few things go here. The Leader of Government Business is running a 'trust us' defence - 'trust us, we won't do the wrong thing' - despite the fact we saw in previous incidents the member for Braddon, Mr Ellis, adjourn parliament when we had a whole bunch of business and a condolence motion before us. The parliament was adjourned just on a whim.

What the Leader of Government Business is saying is that the government wants to retain the ability to shut down parliament at any stage. If we lose this amendment, then the Independents are saying that the government should retain the ability to shut down this parliament at any stage, right? What we saw last time actually happened more than once, but that particular incident was the most egregious, and what happened next? We went to an early election. There was no opportunity for the parliament to get back together and actually fix the problem. That's why we inserted it in the last Sessional Orders. I say to the Independents that if this occurs, we may not get the opportunity to come back to parliament and say to the Independents and Greens we told you so, because the last time it happened we went to an early election.

There was a farcical argument from the leader of Greens business that it could create a constitutional issue, but if it did, the adjournments that the government lost last time we had this rule in didn't cause a constitutional crisis because we just kept sitting. The government actually lost adjournment votes, so there wasn't a constitutional crisis, so that argument is completely irrelevant. I think we need to retain this power because this is a parliament where the government does not have majority, but what the Independents and the Greens are saying to the rest of the world if this amendment doesn't pass is that they want the government to have the ability to shut down parliament whenever they like. I think that is a very dangerous precedent for us to be setting in this parliament.

[10.20 a.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I want to reflect on the goodwill that was established over the last few weeks in the negotiations. On the Standing Orders, I have been a long-time member in this House and have seen the evolution of the conduct of this place, with the removal of the Dorothy Dixers and the ability for our members and private members' time to be expanded. There has been a significant change over the last two parliaments in terms of the conduct of this House and the ability for members not of the government to have a say and to have their issues heard. I acknowledge the good work and negotiations that have been undertaken over the last couple of weeks. Particularly after the activities and events over the last few months, the tone in the discussions has noticeably changed from the government side and at some stage we do need to acknowledge that.

The incident that has been referred to regarding the last parliament was a was a very poor moment for this House. I think we've all reflected on that and I'm sure the government has reflected on that, but one incident should not necessarily cause a major upset in terms of the change to a Standing Order that has worked for many years. I won't reflect on the current Speaker, but I will reflect on the previous Speaker - and I'm sure I'll paraphrase her - I will get a clip around the ear, I am sure, if I get it wrong. She thought that the amendment as being proposed, and the conduct of the Adjournment debate, was a silly idea. She didn't like it either, because it inferred and interrupted the conduct of the House. If there are issues of importance to be debated, we debate them and there are forms of the House to manage those issues. However, at the end of every day, to have the Sword of Damocles over the House and the staff and all the people here for good conduct, is problematic.

The issue that we need to acknowledge - and the fact is - that we've had a lot of discussions and this is the first time I have seen this amendment. The goodwill that has been occurring and building over the last couple of weeks around these important matters should not be ignored and should not be disrespected. Every member has a right to move an amendment, but these are the Standing Orders of the house. We've been in meetings, in discussions, and now we have an amendment from the Opposition at the last moment. I just think; read the room. People are working together. If the government behaves in a poor way, we have the forms of the House to manage that. I can't support the amendment. 

The SPEAKER (Mrs Petrusma) - The question is that the amendment to the motion be agreed to.

STATEMENT BY SPEAKER

Supplementary Questions

[10.28 a.m.]
The SPEAKER - Before we move on to questions, I want to make a statement on supplementary questions in relation to how I intend to rule on supplementary questions. In line with previous rulings in this House, supplementary questions must be actually and accurately related to the original question and/or must relate to or arise from the answer. The purpose of a supplementary question is to elucidate or clarify a matter raised in a primary question or a reply. It is not in order to ask a supplementary question of another minister. Any supplementary question must be directed to the minister initially answering the question.

When a minister has asked that a question be put on notice or said that they will seek further information to inform the House, a supplementary question will not be in order, as was the practise in the last parliament. I will endeavour to ensure consistency in my rulings in respect of supplementary questions and remind members that the Standing Orders Committee will continue to review the standing and sessional orders to address any issues arising.

Absence of Legislative Council Ministers at Question Time

[10.31 a.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I advise the house that as the Legislative Council has not been sitting, the message from the House requesting leave for Legislative Council ministers to attend Question Time in this place has not yet been considered.

Therefore, Mr Duigan, Ms Palmer, and Mr Vincent will be absent from the chamber for Question Time this week. In their absence, the Treasurer will take questions on the portfolios of Infrastructure and Transport, Mr Ellis will take questions on the Housing and Planning portfolio, and I will take questions on the remaining portfolio areas of responsibility. Thank you.


QUESTIONS

TasInsure - Business Case

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.33 a.m.]
During the election campaign, you announced that you would establish TasInsure, a state-owned insurance company. You promised Tasmanians that they would save $250 on their insurance premiums. You even suggested that it was going to reduce grocery prices - claims that have no evidence supporting them. You made hats, jackets, stubby-holders and stickers. You even set up a fake office in Launceston with glossy signs. We have seen the style, Premier, but we haven't seen the substance.

Tasmanians are telling me they are struggling with insurance premiums and the cost of doing business, but they're sceptical of your TasInsure policy, and question whether it is the right approach or even feasible. These Tasmanians want these answers: Do you have a business case for TasInsure, or any modelling that says that Tasmanians will save $250 on their insurance, or that grocery prices will be cheaper because of your policy?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I congratulate the member on his elevation to the position of Leader of the Opposition. I wish you well. 

When it comes to TasInsure, it was a very clear policy commitment as a result of what we were hearing in the community across a range of areas. Whether it was families, small businesses, or community organisations, they were being dramatically impacted by what I termed market failure when it comes to insurance across the country. We have $6 billion of profit for the insurance industry across the nation and exorbitant insurance premium increases. A small business owner I met in Queenstown had some 300 per cent increase in their insurance premiums. When you extrapolate that across the state and insurance premiums going up of that magnitude, or less even, it has serious consequences in terms of the business's ability to be able to afford insurance. Some are not insuring at all, in some circumstances underinsuring, and in other circumstances, businesses closing their doors as a result of the increase in insurance premiums, so I look forward -

Members interjecting.

Mr Mitchell - You should write a letter of unwavering support.

The SPEAKER - Order. I remind the House that the only acceptable forms of interjection are 'hear, hear' or 'shame', so I encourage the honourable member for Lyons to restrict himself to those two, thank you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I look forward to working across the parliament on further developing the commitment of TasInsure to ensure that we consult widely with key stakeholders, that there's a recognition from the honourable member that increases in insurance premiums are indeed a real problem. We will do the work. We have a 100-day commitment. I look forward to receiving advice across departments, including Treasury, when it comes to the commitment of TasInsure, and working with other entities and stakeholders, including the RACT, of course, who have a view on these matters. This is a policy response to a real concern in the community.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Does the Premier have any shred of evidence that Tasmanians will save $250 on their insurance premiums or that grocery prices will be cheaper?

The SPEAKER - The question is in order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you for the question, honourable member. There is no doubt that an intervention in the market, if you like, is needed. I congratulate the Motor Accidents Insurance Board (MAIB), who do such good work in keeping their premiums low and well below the figures that I have seen and heard from small businesses, and from mums and dads across Tasmania. Our stated commitment is very real.

Mr WILLIE - Point of order, Honourable Speaker. Standing Order 45, Relevance. The Premier hasn't gone anywhere near answering the question, which is about evidence for his policy. Does he have any evidence that Tasmanians will save $250 on their insurance premiums or that grocery prices will be lower, as he claimed in the election?

The SPEAKER - I call the Premier to Standing Order 45: Relevance.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you. I was being very relevant when it comes to -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the supplementary question has expired.


TasInsure - Government Commitment

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.38 a.m.]
Independent experts have called TasInsure a reckless scheme that exposes Tasmanian taxpayers to enormous financial risk. There's still no business case, no Treasury modelling, and no evidence it will deliver the savings you promised. It looks like TasInsure is nothing more than an election trick with no real plan behind it to actually help Tasmanians with their insurance costs. You've stopped wearing the jacket and Simon Wood has taken down the signs. Tasmanians want to know: are you still committed to establishing TasInsure? Will you still establish TasInsure even if it exposes Tasmanian taxpayers to enormous financial risk, like all the experts say?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I would hope that, as he travels around Tasmania, he asks these key questions about insurance premiums and the impact on small businesses, the impact on community groups, the impact on families, when it comes to their insurance premiums. If he asked these questions, he would appreciate why we have a stated policy commitment around TasInsure, which we will deliver. I look forward to working across parliament and the community to ensure our stated commitment is delivered on a range of stakeholders, including independent experts, as you say.

It has been interesting to note the 2025 results announcements for insurance companies over the past few weeks. Significant profit increases for major players like Insurance Australia Group reporting a 51 per cent net profit, an increase to $1.36 billion; Suncorp a 52 per cent increase, a $1.8 billion full-year profit; QBE up 21 per cent over the half-year -

Opposition members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you for your interjections. That's a lot of profits going to multinational insurance companies. When families and small businesses are underinsuring or not insuring at all, and the insurance companies are making billions of dollars of profit - the market is broken. I don't want to see a circumstance where we have increased exposure to floods and fire on the mainland and Tasmanians wear the brunt of that. It's about responding to community need. I welcome the input from honourable members, should they wish to contribute. The honourable member, of course, can contribute as well. I look forward to his engagement. I know the honourable member has stated some concerns about budget matters but has boycotted the Multipartisan Budget Panel. Now is the time to be constructive, recognise the challenges that Tasmanians are facing and come up with solutions. We have a solution on this side of the House.

Opposition members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You have no solution to what you say is a problem that you acknowledge, so I welcome the engagement from the honourable member in a constructive way.

Supplementary Question 

The SPEAKER - Before I call on the supplementary, I remind members that if we reach a certain level, I will start issuing warnings. I do not want to suspend any member on the first full day of parliament. Again, I remind all members: 'shame' and 'hear, hear', and not as loud with your interjections. 

Mr WILLIE - My question to the Premier is: will he establish TasInsure even if Treasury recommends against it because of the financial exposure to the state of Tasmania?

The SPEAKER - The supplementary question is in order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the honourable member for his question. We will be receiving advice from a range of sources as we consult with the community. The advice I'm getting from mums and dads, community groups and small businesses is that they've had enough.

Opposition members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - They're either under-insuring, not insuring, or closing their businesses as a result of insurance premiums. That's not sustainable. That's not good for Tasmanians. We have a solution in TasInsure. You have acknowledged the problem - come up with a solution yourself. How about we work together to ensure that we're in the corner of mums and dads and small businesses in this community?


Salmon Industry - Potential Moratorium

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.43 a.m.]
This summer, Tasmanians witnessed a cascade of catastrophes in waterways: jellyfish blooms, paralytic shellfish toxins, and tonnes of dead salmon being hauled out of waters by the truckload and washing up on beaches. We desperately need to end the intensification of salmon production in Tasmania if we're going to avoid a natural disaster like the algal bloom still devastating South Australia's marine waters. You said the salmon industry were on notice in summer and said it again when you promised to pause spatial expansions. You said that pause starts when your review starts - but that's too little, too late for our marine environment.

Honourable Premier, will you truly put big salmon companies on notice? Will you commit to an immediate moratorium on intensifying salmon farming in Tasmania's waterways?

Opposition members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, the honourable Premier has the call.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the Greens for the question. There has been some journey when it comes to the salmon industry in Tasmania. Might I state very clearly, it has been a very proud journey, since its inception in the late 1980s through to now, employing many, many thousands of Tasmanians directly or indirectly. That's why, as minister for Primary Industries, and with other responsibilities that I've had over the last 11 years or so, I have always advocated not only for the industry, but for ensuring there are appropriate regulatory mechanisms by which the industry is monitored. There are significant changes that we've made over the course of the last decade, including the independent Environment Protection Authority (EPA), which we established, regulating the industry and keeping the industry accountable. There are also other penalty provisions for marine debris and other areas of compliance that are regulatory in nature, to ensure the sustainability of the industry.

My belief in the industry is very strong, as it contributes enormously to the Tasmanian community.

Opposition members interjecting

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The reasons why we have continued to further regulate and have oversight of the industry are to ensure the sustainability of the industry; not just for the next year but also for the next many decades, for the value that it provides not only to the economy but to local communities. That's why we have announced the pause on spatial expansion. That's why we have announced the study, on which I look forward to engaging further with members and the community and industry. 

I recognise the algal bloom in South Australia and the circumstances that we found ourselves in earlier this year. The industry was on notice. I said that very clearly in an answer to a question you asked me back in March this year. I want what's best for the community and the industry because of the jobs that it creates. If that means a study and a pause on spatial expansion to ensure continuous improvement, then that is a very small price to pay to ensure that sustainability - in my view, that we've always done, in the belief of the industry to ensure that it has the social licence of the community with which to continue. I look forward to engaging with the industry and the community to ensure its sustainability.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, honourable Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Dr WOODRUFF - Restating the question and clarifying precisely, Premier, will you commit to an immediate moratorium on intensifying salmon production, salmon farming in Tasmania?

The SPEAKER - The question does respond to the original question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the honourable member for the question. Notwithstanding my previous answer, the intent of the pause is that there will be no increase in the total lease area subject to salmon farming operations while the independent studies are being undertaken. While the pause is in place, authorisation to farm salmon with dormant leases will not be granted unless a process was already being actively pursued or under consideration.

Authorisation to deploy pens in the North Storm Bay will not be granted. Consistent with the commitments to the Salmon Industry Plan 2023, government will commence planning processes to reclassify unoccupied marine farming zones to remove finfish as a permitted species for culturing within those zones. That is the intent of the pause -

Dr Woodruff - It doesn't cover off on intensification.

Mr Winter - Yeah, that's right.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Well, it is important the lessons were learned from this year about the circumstances which were -

The SPEAKER - The honourable Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Metro Tasmania and Homes Tasmania - Government Management

Mr O'BYRNE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.48 a.m.]
In the last parliament, your government triggered a review of government business enterprises and state-owned companies with a view to assessing their most appropriate structure and ownership model. You are actively considering the options of privatisation. You sensibly walked this back during the election campaign, but the issue of poor performance has not disappeared. Two in particular, Metro Tasmania and Homes Tasmania, are failing in their duty to deliver essential services to the Tasmanian community.

Metro is no longer financially sustainable - their words not mine - and two years on from a temporary service adjustment, more than 100 services are still cancelled. The housing crisis worsens each day on Homes Tasmania's watch. Will you consider bringing public transport and housing back into the heart of government, in government ownership and direct control, to ensure the delivery of these basic, essential public services?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. In the question he has stated policy intention and belief about Homes Tasmania and Metro. As you have acknowledged in your question, we have witnessed the consequences of the failure of government business governance and we are very determined that that's not repeated across the areas of government business enterprises, notwithstanding the fact that Minister Vincent and I were at berth 3 in East Devonport just a few days ago. I commend the new TT-Line management and board for the great progress that they have made since we intervened in that project.

Ms Butler - Are you for real?

Mr ROCKLIFF - You are asking me about a policy commitment, honourable member for Franklin -

Ms Butler - Good job. Well done, well done you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, honourable Ms Butler, I appreciate that. This is a policy question which you could bring to the parliament and debate that in a more fulsome way. I am not committing to your ask at this particular time. I will need to consult with my colleagues about those stated commitments. Of course, we have the independent review into Homes Tasmania, the Crawford report and the Tasmanian Government's response were both tabled in parliament and published prior to the election.

The report made it clear that there are some elements of the original model for Homes Tasmania that have not delivered on stakeholder expectations and needed action. We will be ensuring that the Department of State Growth works with Homes Tasmania and other relevant departments to address and implement the independent reports' 20 recommendations. That will be a priority of the new Minister for Housing.

That's our policy at this stated point in time, but if the member wishes to debate further policy commitments, I welcome an opportunity for that discussion.


Inquiry into the Replacement of the Breast Screening Bus, Luna

Ms JOHNSTON question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING

[10.52 a.m.]
Last week you told Tasmanian women that the procurement process to replace the breast screen bus Luna was ongoing and that a replacement will be delivered in 12 months' time. Has an order for the replacement bus actually been placed yet? If so, could you please name the supplier or suppliers, and can you tell us what evidence you're relying on when you say replacement bus will be delivered in 12 months?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for her question. This has been a priority for me since being elected and being appointed to this role. I want to make it clear that the government is committed to breast screening for Tasmanian women. The original breast screen bus called Luna, covering eastern, southern and western Tasmania, has been retired following a technical assessment that was undertaken when water damage caused electrical issues.

Funding has been committed for a replacement bus which the department is in the process of procuring. The replacement bus is now expected to be back on the road in the next 12 months, due to limited availability for the fit out of the mobile screening units across the country. I am as disappointed as the member is with this and I have instructed the department to do everything possible to expedite the replacement, noting the complexities involved with procuring these specialised screening units.

I sincerely apologise to those impacted, including those on the east coast and in the north-east, where scheduled screenings have been cancelled. The department has directly communicated with affected clients to offer alternative appointments at other breast screen sites at Rosny, Hobart and Launceston to ensure that women can still access their screenings. To assist affected clients, patient travel assistance and additional transport options will be made available for those Tasmanians affected by this.

The department has been working closely with organisations on the east coast to arrange community transport for group screening bookings. I'm advised that a free charter bus for those requiring breast screening services and transportation is scheduled from the east coast to Hobart early next month, with more to be scheduled as needed. An immediate action has also been taken to identify additional interim solutions. This includes the establishment of an interim breast screen site in Devonport, which will enable the redeployment of the second breast screen bus from the Devonport region to other communities.

I urge anybody requiring a breast screen to call 132 050 to book an appointment. The Government is of course, as part of our election commitments, boosting access to life-saving breast screening services with new permanent breast screening clinics which will be located in Kingborough, Devonport, Triabunna and Glenorchy. These clinics will provide free screening for eligible Tasmanians, which will make it easier for women to access those services closer to their home, but also make those mobile units available for servicing rural and remote locations.

I'm happy to continue to work with the member towards and other members in this place as we finalise the procurement of that new bus and to make sure that patients are not impacted in the meantime.

Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

The honourable minister spoke about the procuring process and that the procuring process is ongoing. Can you actually confirm whether an order has actually been placed and if an order hasn't been placed, then what guarantees have you got that one will be available within 12 months?

The SPEAKER - The supplementary question is in order. 

Mrs ARCHER - Thanks to the honourable member for that question. I understand that procurement is underway, but I'm happy to seek further information and come back to the House with an update.


QUESTIONS

Mr GEORGE question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Mr PEARCE

[10.56 a.m.]
Thank you, honourable Speaker, for my first opportunity to contribute. My question is to the honourable Minister for Primary Industries and noting the distressing and increasing number of deaths of marine wildlife and sea birds that have become entangled or otherwise come into contact with the industrial salmon farms in Storm Bay and other waterways in the southeast of the state. This includes seals, cormorants, and now four dolphins this year. Will the minister take urgent action by calling in the executives of the multinational salmon farms and warn them that the deaths of marine animals, including the recent four dolphins, is unacceptable, a breach of their obligations, and will not be tolerated in Tasmania? Will you also ensure that severe and vastly increased penalties will be imposed for such breaches?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. I also note for the House the members' interest in previous briefings I have conducted with the remainder of the crossbench and others in this place on similar matters in the past. It's that level of transparency and openness that I want to continue. I think it was done in good vein and good faith. I thank the members of the crossbench for participating in that. I advise that if there is any specific question they want answered in relation to marine science, by all means contact me and I will avail them of that.

The member raises a very serious issue when it comes to mammal deaths in our marine environment. The Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRE Tasmania) regulates wildlife interactions and the use of seal management options in the marine farming industry in Tasmania. Under the seal management framework, the data is reported by NRE Tasmania's Wildlife Health and Marine Section monthly and is co-located. That's what the member is referring to today.

The review is published on the department's website every six months. I am advised that aquaculture companies are encouraged to report wildlife deaths promptly to enable the department to collate suitable carcasses for postmortem investigation which can help confirm the cause of death and monitor for disease. The management of wildlife interactions with aquaculture activities is very complex and, like land-based farming, it is ongoing and an ongoing challenge for marine farm operators.

The four cetacean mortalities recorded between January and June 2025 were all short-beaked common dolphins. NRE Tasmania has requested further information from industry to assist in reviewing the circumstances surrounding those dolphin mortalities the honourable member mentioned. 

In relation to the seal deaths that he also mentioned in his question, over the past four years, from 2020-21 to 2024-25, there has been a 78 per cent decrease in seal mortalities reported by salmon industries. That tells me that we are at least moving in the right direction.

In relation to those dolphin deaths of which he spoke, once that information is made available to NRE Tasmania, I am willing to share that with him and, in fact, the House. 

Supplementary Question

Mr GEORGE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr GEORGE - I ask the honourable Minister for Primary Industries and Water to answer the question. Is he prepared to call in the executives of the multinational salmon farms and make it very clear to them that mortalities of native wild animals, both seabirds and marine animals, is unacceptable? Is he prepared to warn them that they will face severe penalties for continued mortalities?

The SPEAKER - That is reflecting on the original question, so I draw the minister's attention to that. 

Mr PEARCE - Honourable Speaker, once that information is availed from industry back to NRE Tasmania, then we will study that. We need to make absolutely clear what is the cause of death and other scientific factors that will affect the ongoing - as you put it - warnings or statutory statements made to industry in relation to this. Might I say that the standards are very clear in relation to mammals operating and being killed adjacent to salmon farming. I intend to maintain the standards. As I have pointed out to the Independent member in previous discussions, I am here to ensure that those standards are adhered to.


TasInsure - Financial Risk

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[11.01 a.m.]
Tasmanians are raising issues about your TasInsure policy with me and we are asking questions on their behalf. Experts, including Saul Eslake and the Insurance Council of Australia, have warned that your flagship TasInsure policy poses an enormous financial risk to Tasmanian taxpayers and does nothing to address the real causes of rising insurance premiums. Saul Eslake said that governments have no business running insurance companies and called it 'just about the worst idea to come out of a major political party in Tasmania that I can remember'. The Insurance Council of Australia has also slammed your policy as reckless, pointing out that all other states and territories, including Tasmania, sold off their government insurance companies decades ago for good reason. Tasmanians are asking why you think your government can succeed in running a state-owned insurer when you can barely run government businesses you already have, like TT-Line?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. The Insurance Council of Tasmania, which you mentioned, represents the industry that had $6 billion worth of profit. That is one of the reasons where we've got market failure, when you have all those profits -

Mr Willie - You have no business case. 

Ms Finlay - No evidence.

The SPEAKER - Order. The Deputy Leader and the Leader of the Opposition will allow the Premier to be heard. You can ask another question or a supplementary soon, but I ask that the Premier be heard in silence, please.

Mr ROCKLIFF - All those exorbitant increases in insurance premiums I've given a number of examples of over the last number of months. We are listening to the community. Tasmanians want us to intervene in the insurance market in Tasmania and we will intervene. We will also consult with all key stakeholders and welcome the opportunity to consult with the Insurance Council of Tasmania, Mr Eslake, and other key stakeholders, but most importantly the mums and dads, the families, the community groups, and the small businesses that are seeing exorbitant increases in their insurance premiums. This is a policy challenge. We've stepped up to that policy challenge and have a policy around TasInsure.

Ms Finlay - No evidence, shame.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Opposition, this is your first warning because you are making constant interjections.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I recognise the honourable member in his question has cited examples of state-owned insurance companies, including the Tasmanian Government Insurance Office (TGIO) I believe it was, back in the late 80s, early 90s. Decisions were made across the nation around those policy decisions for that time, but we are in a different time where we have small businesses that have increased insurance premiums of some 300 per cent in regional Tasmania. We're responding to what we're hearing. We're listening and learning. There's nothing shameful about that, honourable member Ms Finlay. You would expect us to listen to the community on a range of areas.

Opposition members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Clearly, on a number of policy matters, you're not reading the room either, I must say. I would suggest that the honourable member continues to get out and about in the community, listen to the needs of mums and dads, families, small businesses and community groups and come up with a solution. I'm happy to engage with you on our solution.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Premier's time for answering the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Mr WILLIE - How does the Premier think he can run a state-based insurance company when every other state and territory has abandoned the idea and he struggles to run companies like TT-Line as it is?

The SPEAKER - Your last question was about every other state and territory. That wasn't mentioned in your original question, so that really is a new question.

Mr WILLIE - I mentioned states and territories in my first question.

The SPEAKER - Right, okay; the question is in order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the honourable member for his question, but we're not followers in Tasmania, we're leaders. I look forward to the policy positions of other states and territories - or indeed, oppositions - that replicate TasInsure, whether that be Vic-Insure or WA-Insure, Qld-Insure. I reckon there's going to be lots of state-based insurers potentially up and running. I'm not going to make light, though, of the need to intervene in the market. I recognise the honourable member is exercised about the policy because it is a good policy and responds to the need. MAIB is a very successfully run insurance company.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


TasInsure - Impact on Insurance Premiums and Grocery Prices

Mr WILLIE question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[11.07 a.m.]
I've travelled all over Tasmania in the past weeks and listened to people like Scott from Scottsdale who told me how hard and expensive it is to insure his farm, business and shop. During the election, the honourable Premier, Mr Rockliff, promised Tasmanians that TasInsure would save them $250 on their insurance premiums and even suggested it will make groceries cheaper - claims that clearly have no supporting evidence. What evidence or analysis has Treasury provided to prove that TasInsure will save Tasmanians $250 on their insurance premiums or that groceries will be cheaper? Don't you think Tasmanians like Scott deserve an explanation? Do you support this market intervention as Treasurer?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. Let there be no doubt, as a member of Cabinet, guess what? Of course I support the policy. I am sure that there would not be any doubt in this room that I support the policies of the government. It might come as a surprise to the Leader of the Opposition. I do not know how you transact business over there. I can assure you we are a unified team over here and we are more than willing to back each other.

In relation to Scott from Scottsdale - and I look forward to meeting Scott one day if he actually exists, but I will take your word for that. In relation to premiums, there is no doubt that the people of Tasmania are suffering under higher premiums in circumstances where, in fairness, in my assessment, the risk is not commensurate with the high premiums that have been claimed and charged by insurance companies. A very good example is a government-owned insurance company, the Motor Accidents Insurance Board, where we have the lowest premiums in the country and the most generous payments, and it is providing a dividend to the government and to the budget.

Mr Willie - You're going to wreck it.

Ms Haddad - It's up for grabs. Highest bidder.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. I remind the members of the Opposition you have got three more questions to go. I ask that the honourable Treasurer is heard in silence please.

Mr ABETZ - What a good idea, Honourable Speaker, thank you very much.

That is a triple bottom line in relation to the Motor Accidents Insurance Board, a government-run insurance business.

I would say to colleagues that we, as a government, are agile and committed to the private sector, but when there is market failure or where there are circumstances where the government can deliver better than the private sector, then of course we will embrace that.

In relation to the premiums and the savings, it makes good sense that if premiums come down when you have examples, as the Premier indicated to us, of businesses no longer insuring or having a 300 per cent increase in their premiums. Here is a little lesson in economics for the Leader of the Opposition: when you have those extra costs imposed on business, guess what it does? It increases prices. Therefore, if you can put downward pressure on premiums, guess what? It puts downward pressure on prices. As a result, the consumers and the people of Tasmania will be better off.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Can the honourable Treasurer say whether he will direct Treasury to model whether TasInsure will save Tasmanians $250 on their insurance premiums or that grocery prices will be lower as the Premier claimed in the election campaign? We see no evidence.

The SPEAKER - That does go back to the original question.

Mr ABETZ - Honourable Speaker, ongoing work is being done in relation to TasInsure. As the Premier indicated, there are various discussions taking place, including with the RACT. We are a collaborative government. We are willing to work with the community and with the RACT. I have already set out the exceptionally good circumstances of the Motor Accidents Insurance Board.

Mr Mitchell - You can't make it work. You would have released it by now.

The SPEAKER - Honourable member for Lyons, the question has been asked. You need to listen to it.

Mr ABETZ - If we can collaborate with the Motor Accidents Insurance Board and the RACT, I have every confidence that the people of Tasmania can and will be better off. We will continue to work to ensure that the best possible model is delivered for the benefit of the people of Tasmania.


Salmon Industry - Florfenicol Fast-Tracking

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Mr PEARCE

[11.13 a.m.]
In August, you briefed MPs on why your department made an emergency application to the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) to fast-track florfenicol, which is an unregistered antibiotic that salmon companies want to dump in the hundreds of kilos in Tasmania's public waters. Despite acknowledging the presence of diseased salmon in pens now during winter, senior agency staff were at pains to advise us there is no actual emergency occurring. APVMA rules state that an emergency permit can only be approved in the case of a genuine emergency. You are fast-tracking florfenicol, an untested antibiotic with high risk of resistance in native fish and the food chain. It's clear the emergency your government is focused on is maintaining the profits of multinational corporations. Will you stop the fast-tracked application of florfenicol and order companies to destock their leases to mitigate the coming marine disaster?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, in relation to the use of the drug florfenicol, the application was made from industry in a preventative measure prior to water temperatures exceeding 13 or 14 degrees and increased risks coming in the environment. I welcome that preventative measure. Any form of therapeutant that is applied to those animals in the name of animal husbandry is a good thing in my book.

We will continue to support our industry as it recovers from an unprecedented summer mortality event. No-one here wants to see another one of those. The industry doesn't want to see that either. The government and industry have been working hand in hand and hand in glove, to ensure that as we approach summer, the best possible outcomes are achieved for animal welfare and environmental perspective as we work to continue to make this happen.

I have been very open and upfront on the knowns and the unknowns when it comes to biosecurity and the welfare of farmed salmon in southern Tasmania. I facilitated a comprehensive briefing to members in parliament just a few weeks ago. Two days later, on 13 August, I received a briefing on salmon biosecurity management and the identification of florfenicol as a potential tool to combat future disease risk. We do not want another mass death. In the interest of providing this to members of parliament with an update on information that was presented to me regarding salmon biosecurity and florfenicol use, I extended an invitation to the opposition, the Greens, Independent members and parliament for a crossbench agency, which took place on 15 August. At that briefing, noting that the caretaker conventions were in place at the time, the secretary of NRE undertook to provide the leader of the Greens with additional information, which I understand was provided the following day, Monday 18 August. It was made clear to attendees of that joint briefing that there had not been any reports of exceedance of mandated mortality reporting thresholds at that stage.

Supplementary Question

 [Bookmark: _Hlk208315590] Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will allow the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - Thank you, honourable minister. Can you confirm that you've just said that this would be a preventative measure tool?

The SPEAKER - I will ask the honourable minister to take his seat, please.

Dr WOODRUFF - Will the honourable minister desist in the department's application for an emergency permit for florfenicol, and instead proceed to the proper process, which is a full permit application, so that a proper assessment of environmental impacts can occur?

Mr PEARCE - The industry has invested heavily in fish vaccine and the development of vaccine use and other biosecurity measures. If, on the advice of a veterinarian, fish and marine farms require treatment with antibiotics, farmers must advise the EPA director and the Chief Veterinary Officer before treatment is applied and comply with any requirements for EPA residue testing and reporting.

In Tasmania, all veterinarians are required to comply with the Poisons Act, the Code of Practice for the Supply and the Use of Veterinary Chemical Products, which is legally applied under the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Control of Use) Order 2001, and legislated.

I'm advised that the Salmonid Biosecurity Program, which is enforced through regulation under the Biosecurity Act 2019, requires all antibiotic use in marine operations to comply with the regulatory requirements in the use of the marine environment and be reported.


Forensics Staff Availability for Assault Victim-Survivors

Prof RAZAY question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mrs ARCHER

[11.18 a.m.]
It has been reported recently in the media that there is concern about the availability of staff trained as forensic medical examiners for victim-survivors of sexual and domestic violence. According to the Tasmanian Third Family and Sexual Action Plan 2022-27 item 23: (tbc)

A forensic medical examiner should be available for victim-survivors in all of our hospitals: Royal Hobart, Launceston General, and Northwest Hospital.

Can the honourable minister give assurance to the House and to Tasmania that victim-survivors will have access to all these services in their local hospital and that there will be no cut in these services in the future?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question and congratulate him on his election to this place. Our government is committed to providing trauma-informed care and treatment to anyone who experiences sexual harm and family violence. The Department of Health works closely with Tasmania Police, Laurel House and other community services. I'm advised that a member of the Sexual Assault Forensic Examination service (SAFE) is on call from 5.00 p.m. to 8.00 a.m. Calls are triaged and staff attend when needed. In the north-west, appropriately trained staff also undertake an on-call arrangement to provide this service after hours.

The SAFE service is delivered by medical officers, nurses and midwives who have undertaken additional specialised training in forensic examinations. This training is highly specialised and necessary to ensure that the care provided is sensitive to the needs of the person following a sexual assault or family violence and ensures evidentiary requirements are met.

I'm further advised that the department is actively exploring all possible avenues to provide the opportunity for more staff to undertake specialised training.

Please be assured that anyone who presents to our hospitals to seek treatment will always be provided with the care and support that they need.

To be clear, we are investing in the SAFE program and are looking to increase staff trained in this highly specialised area. I can assure everyone in the community that there will be absolutely no cuts to these important services, nor will anyone be forced to travel to other hospitals to access them.


TasInsure - Impact on State's Credit Rating

Mr WILLIE question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[11.21 a.m.]
Credit rating agencies have already downgraded Tasmania's outlook to 'negative', warning that rising debt and financial exposure could trigger a full downgrade. Now the honourable Premier wants to add TasInsure, a government-run insurance company with no business case, no modelling, and no evidence that it will benefit Tasmanians. Tasmanians are asking us to raise this with you because they are worried this plan has not been thought through.

Can you guarantee that implementing this policy won't immediately trigger a credit rating downgrade that will increase borrowing costs that will hurt schools, hospitals and services that Tasmanians rely on?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The issue of credit ratings is not something on which I'm going to speculate. It seems as though the Leader of the Opposition enjoys speculating, hoping for a downgrade. That would not be within the interest of the people of Tasmania and I would - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The members of the Opposition have asked a question. I ask that the Treasurer be heard in silence. You have the chance of a supplementary question, or you still have another two questions to go. I ask that the honourable Treasurer be heard in silence.

Mr ABETZ - I invite the Leader of the Opposition to consider the approach he and the Opposition are taking to these matters because they, with respect, spectacularly failed on July 19 by being highly critical of the budget but then not providing an alternative, saying that our pathway to surplus was not acceptable, but then didn't offer their own pathway to surplus. Then they had a motion of no confidence in the Premier but did not offer themselves up as an alternate premier. So, really strong on the criticism, but unable to provide a positive alternative for the people of Tasmania, and they voted accordingly.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ABETZ - In relation to the issue of credit ratings, I invite the Leader of the Opposition and all those in the Opposition to consider a new start and talk up Tasmania, talk about the opportunities, talk about the possibilities, and invite people, and indeed the credit rating agencies, to consider why is it that in Tasmania we have the highest business confidence of any state or territory? The Leader of the Opposition can laugh at that, but I would have thought the business community might have a bit of a hunch as to how the economy is going.

Mr Willie - The TCCI said it's not safe to do business here because of your government.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ABETZ - We have currently the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in this state, I would have thought another big tick for our economy, something that I would invite the credit rating agencies to consider. 

In relation to the totality of the government's approach to these matters, we are mindful of the motion of no confidence that got carried - the first one, not the second one - and we are and will be engaged in relation to the matters of budget repair. We look forward to the collaboration of everybody, because this is a Tasmanian task, a task for all of us.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Treasurer's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE -Honourable Speaker, a supplementary question?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Does Treasury consider TasInsure credit risk?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Treasurer, it is in line with the original question.

Mr ABETZ - I'm not going to respond specifically as to advice I may or may not be receiving in relation to these matters.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Listen to the honourable Treasurer's response. Let's be very clear, as a government, we can accept advice that ultimately we as a government decide. If that were not the case, there would be no need for anybody in this Chamber. We are democratically elected to make decisions, we seek advice, we consider that advice and ultimately we make the determination, and that is a fundamental lesson of democracy -

Mr Mitchell - Chairman Mao would be proud.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Honourable Member for Lyons, this is your first warning, because you are quite loud. 

Mr ABETZ - which I would invite the Leader of the Opposition to contemplate, consider and accept.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Impact on State Budget

Mr BAYLEY question to the PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.26 a.m.]
Tasmania's budget situation is in a terrible situation. Treasury had advised serious action needs to be taken to address it. We cannot just grow the economy to dig ourselves out of this budget hole. We need to cut spending and raise revenue. Services like health and housing are already struggling to meet the needs of Tasmanians and they can't face any more cuts. It's obvious to all that a debt of almost $2 billion over a decade for the stadium is untenable in this budget mess. Support for the Tassie Devils teams continues to build. We've got teams heading out into the VFL and AFLW team competitions next year and it's happening with or without the stadium. How much is too much to spend on the stadium? Doesn't the budget situation compel you to relieve Tasmanians of the debt and division of the stadium? Or are you planning to make further cuts to Tasmania's essential services to meet the demands of the AFL?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question and longstanding interest when it comes to stadia infrastructure. I also note his acknowledgement of the momentum of the Tasmania Devils and that the recent announcement about the VFL and VFLW was also very exciting.

Can I also say that momentum and excitement is building particularly among young people of all circumstances and backgrounds across Tasmania. There is too much to lose by not proceeding with such critical infrastructure on which we will receive the TPC report next Wednesday on 17 September. Then we will be informed about the next processes needed to ensure the parliament has its say with respect to that matter.

I welcome the bipartisanship from the former leader of the opposition and the new Leader of the Opposition when it comes to the stadium project. That has been restated in recent days, as I have read, which I welcome. There were a number of members of parliament in major parties and Independents - and I acknowledge Mr O'Byrne's passion and leadership on this matter. An overwhelming majority of Tasmanians voted for pro-stadium and pro-AFL Devils team candidates.

I recognise the fact that we've got to bring people along on the journey. Tasmanians very clearly have had their say. I noted the Greens were very clear in their election campaign with their no-stadium stickers and all sorts of matters as well. It's very pleasing that in another referendum, if you like, on the stadium, as there was back in March of 2024, that overwhelmingly the majority of members in this place were elected on a pro-stadium stance, which is fantastic because of the economic and social value that project will bring to an area that's been underdeveloped for decades. We have worked in collaboration with the federal government and many members of the community to see this project come to fruition.


Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - I let the Premier go there because there was a lot in the preamble, but the question was really clear. He said not proceeding is not an option. We've got the TPC report coming next week. You have not set an upper limit on this stadium. How much is too much to spend on the stadium?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Honourable Speaker, we need to invest to continue to grow our economy. If governments of all persuasions over the course of the last 100 years had the belief not to invest in key enabling infrastructure because it doesn't come back and benefit the community more broadly, we'd be living in paddocks and caves. We've got to continue to grow the economy and continue to invest in enabling infrastructure. 

Across the forward Estimates in the Budget as presented there was a reduction in capital infrastructure spend, so this is well within our capability to deliver, both in terms of getting money out the door and creating those 4000 jobs in construction. I welcome the engagement of unions when it comes to this key project as well. Mr Abetz and I -

The SPEAKER - The honourable Premier's time has expired. 


Marinus Link - Threat to Major Industrials - Secrecy

Mr GARLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.32 a.m.]
In May your government received the whole-of-state business case for Marinus Link. It warned that if Marinus Link goes ahead, our major industrials will face a 50 per cent hike in their transmission fees and are very likely to see the end of their discounted electricity prices as Hydro goes into full electricity trader mode and seeks the highest price for its product on the mainland. The whole-of-state business case warns an increase in wholesale energy prices for the major industrials may have a greater negative on their viability than the transmission price increases. The expert panel even warned your government that this could force one or more of the major industrials to close. 

At a time when the future of major industrials in Tasmania is already precarious, why was this information kept from the public during the election campaign and prior to your government committing us to Marinus Link?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question and long-standing interest in this matter. Our government has made a very key decision when it comes to Marinus Link, which has been progressing since about 2017. A lot of work has been done on Marinus Link, which is all about securing Tasmania's energy future, and renewable energy future in that.

Thankfully, our forebears had the foresight to build hydro industrialisation schemes of which we are benefiting enormously now. We want to use that baseline to ensure we can attract further investment, in wind and solar predominantly, in terms of renewable energy opportunity - notwithstanding Tarraleah upgrades and other turbine upgrades on the West Coast and Cethana as well. This is a crucial project and a very key decision that this government made, albeit the timing, I recognise, was challenging in terms of caretaker mode and the like. You mentioned - 

Mr GARLAND - Honourable speaker, relevance. The question was: why was this information kept from the public during the election campaign and prior to your government committing us to Marinus Link? 

The SPEAKER - I will remind members to call a point of order and Standing Order 45: Relevance for that one. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, the report was received and then we went into caretaker. During that time of caretaker, officials from the Commonwealth and the state government continued to work to secure the best deal possible for Tasmania. As a result of that, and their very good work, a better deal was secured.

When it comes to the other part of your first question around major industrials, we need more energy in Tasmania to support our major industrials but also Marinus, to attract more major industrials and businesses to Tasmania as a result of that increased energy capacity. What is also crucial about Marinus is the ability for us to generate our own state-sourced revenue. That is limited at this particular time because, I believe, more than two-thirds of our revenue comes from the federal government and then we have limited opportunities. What the business case demonstrated is that, on average, around $400 million per year or more will benefit Tasmania's bottom line. That's on top of the existing Hydro profits. 

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Huon Aquaculture - Disease Outbreak Incident

Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Mr PEARCE 

[11.36 a.m.]
The Independent member for Franklin, Mr George, told the media that he received a call from the Premier on 14 August 2025 informing him of a very serious event in the salmon industry that required an emergency response. The next morning, you hosted an urgent briefing for members where the Greens leader said they learned there was a disease outbreak in a Huon Aquaculture pen. Later that day, during a press conference, you said that, in fact, 'There is no outbreak' - contradicting the Premier's claims. Salmon Tasmania issued a media release and said that the event didn't even exist. 

Do you intend on making a habit of contradicting the Premier? Industry workers want to know, was there a serious event or not? Which is it?

ANSWER 

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for her question. The information that I provided you, that you quoted during your question, I stand by.

Ms Finlay - If it wasn't a serious event, then the Premier lied to Tasmanians.

The SPEAKER - Order. The word 'lie' is out of order. Withdraw the comment.

Ms Finlay - I Withdraw.

Mr PEARCE - I can only inform you on the facts in front of me at the time and what I said on that particular date that you quoted. If you want me to second guess what the Premier said, I suggest the member speaks with the Premier.


Supplementary Question

Ms FINLAY - A supplementary question, honourable Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary.

Ms FINLAY - Minister, was there a serious event or not? If you say there wasn't, was the Premier not telling the truth to Mr George and Tasmanians? 

Mr PEARCE - Honourable Speaker, I refer to my previous answer. My previous answer was very clear. At the time that I -

Ms Finlay - The Premier's not telling the truth?

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked a question. We cannot pre-empt what the minister is going to say. I ask that he is heard in silence please.

Mr PEARCE - At the time that I gave that briefing to crossbenchers, and by that I mean anyone who was invited to that particular briefing, there was no excess of the reportable limit in the salmon industry - and I stand by that fact.


March for Australia Demonstrations - Government Condemnation

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[11.39 a.m.]
On 31 August 2025 there were organised marches, including in Tasmania, at which speakers' vitriol targeted migrants and Palawa people alike. Many people were made to feel scared and unwelcome in Lutruwita/Tasmania, their home.

The West Australian Premier said similar marches in his state were 'a disgrace'. The Victorian Premier, Jacinta Allan, condemned them and the attack on the Aboriginal Camp Sovereignty. The New South Wales Premier, Chris Minns, strongly criticised the organisers afterwards, and the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, has been condemning them publicly.

The recent announcement of a ministry for multicultural affairs in your government was welcomed by the Greens. Premier, distressingly, both you and your new minister for multicultural affairs were silent about these rallies, which is a stark contrast to other government leaders. Premier, what message do you have to Palawa and multicultural communities? Will you condemn the racist sentiment of these rallies?

The SPEAKER - The honourable member's time for asking the question has expired.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. The nub of question was about condemning racism, which, of course I do, in all its forms. Irrespective of how that racism is expressed or presented, I condemn it wholeheartedly. What Tasmania has is a very proud history around multiculturalism, welcoming people to Tasmania from all walks of life and all places around the world.

We have a very dark history regarding indigenous Tasmanians, of which we have work underway, led by the honourable Speaker and now the honourable member for Aboriginal Affairs, Ms Archer, about truth-telling and healing. When it comes to embracing all walks of life, all cultures, irrespective of where in the world people come from and arrive on Tasmanian shores, we need and must embrace Tasmanians and celebrate our migrant history. Of course I condemn any racism and always will do.

I am very proud of the fact that our Minister for Multicultural Affairs has embraced the responsibility. We have made a very clear commitment to a multicultural affairs minister, which I am proud of, and I am sure Ms Ogilvie will also lead the charge when it comes to supporting an inclusive Tasmania.


Huon Aquaculture - Disease Outbreak Incident

Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Mr PEARCE

[11.42 a.m.]
Whose idea was it to hold the briefing with MPs on 15 August regarding this so-called crisis in the salmon industry? Yours or the Premier's? You have said this morning that you want to be open and upfront. When you hosted the briefing and held your media conference on that day, were you aware that just two days later the Premier would be announcing a moratorium and a full review into the industry, turning the lives of workers, their families and the communities that they live within upside-down.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for her question and her interest in this matter and I can refer to my previous answer. The issue in relation to that briefing was a serious one. The issue of the intended use of Florfenicol posed public-interest issues. The Premier and I discussed that at length. We felt mutually that the crossbench would benefit from that information in a transparent way, and the way in which that was presented was open and honest.

In relation to the member's inference that something to the contrary was said by a third person, then I would suggest, with respect, Speaker, that that member speak to the person she refers to.

Members interjecting.

Supplementary Question

Ms FINLAY - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms FINLAY - Minister, the question was very particular. Were you aware that just two days later the Premier was going to announce a moratorium and a full review of the industry, turning the lives of workers, their families and their communities upside-down?

The SPEAKER - Before the minister comes, I do remind the member that for Hansard to accurately record questions, you either need to talk into your microphone or come to the despatch box because some of your question may not have been recorded.

Ms FINLAY - Would you like me to repeat it, Speaker?

Mr Abetz -  No, thank you.

The SPEAKER - We heard it, but just for the next time, honourable Minister.

Mr PEARCE - Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable minister for her supplementary question. I am many things. One thing I am not is a fortune-teller. I cannot predict the future. At the time - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr PEARCE - Are you going to let me finish? At the time that the member refers to, I could not see into the future as to what the Premier would or would not say.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Time Expired.


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

West Tamar Highway Upgrades - Impact on Businesses

Mr FAIRS question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

[11.46 a.m.]
Honourable Speaker, my question is from Chris of Legana. The West Tamar Highway upgrades are impacting businesses in the area. For example, Roam Coffee at Legana in the West Tamar Highway are having to consider reducing the number of staff or even closing their doors. Roam Coffee is a small, locally-owned business which employs young members of the Legana community. The proprietors have expressed concerns about the lack of engagement with local business and the lack of known timelines for completion. Minister, can you please provide an updated timeline for the project?


Peron Dunes - Buggy Race Impact on Threatened Shore Bird Breeding

Ms BADGER question to MINISTER for PARKS, Mr DUIGAN

Honourable Speaker, my question is from constituents in St Helens. Minister, Parks renewed the Peron Dunes buggy race event permit for five more years. The race is held at the exact time of year that Hooded Plovers and Fairy Terns, both threatened species, are breeding. Experts have been sounding the alarm for years. This event disrupts nesting and causes these threatened birds to abandon the site, a fact that should have been evident in the Reserve Activity Assessment (RAA) process. Is it the case that the RAA was in fact not completed before the event permit was granted? Minister, please provide the dates that both the RAA and the event permit were completed. And why allow an event in the conservation area that risks already threatened species? Will you at least take the bare minimum action to reschedule the event outside of the shore bird breeding season?


Special Interest Vehicle Registration Scheme - Review

Mr JAENSCH question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

Honourable Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Transport on behalf of people in my electorate who own classic cars and other special interest vehicles. Can the Minister please advise when the review of the special interest vehicle registration scheme will be finalised, and any changes announced?


Macquarie Harbour - Ban on Recreational Netting Review

Ms DOW question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Mr PEARCE

Honourable Speaker, my question is from Gary from Penguin. Gary asked the Parliament will the new Minister for Primary Industry and Water, Gavin Pearce, review the Liberal Government's decision taken in 2024 to ban recreational netting in Macquarie Harbour for recreational fishers, allowing recreational fishers back into the harbour?


Caravan Parks - Residential Use Regulations

Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER for SMALL BUSINESS, TRADE and CONSUMER AFFAIRS, Mr BARNETT

Honourable Speaker, my question comes from Cheryl, who lives in Beauty Point and is on behalf of the Beauty Point Tourist Park Residents Association. Tasmania is the only jurisdiction in Australia that does not regulate the residential use of caravan parks. The absence of legislation means residents have little to no protection. The reason they have no protection is because your government has failed to act despite being aware of the problem for a number of years. Will you now show that you care and do something constructive instead of wilfully neglecting the plight of highly vulnerable Tasmanians? Will you undertake to introduce and have debated the legislation before the end of the year?


Lyons - Fire Season Preparation

Mr SHELTON question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

Honourable Speaker, my question is for the Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Management. As Lyons is almost 50 per cent of the state, it involves the preparation for the fire season. The electorate of Lyons has a number of areas which are prone to greater fire risk. Can the minister please outline the activities undertaken by Tas Fire Service to prepare for the upcoming bushfire season and, if possible, the number of hectares of fuel-reduction burns achieved over the previous winter.


Murchison Highway - Signage and Line Markings Near Waratah

Ms DOW question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

[11.49 a.m.]
Honourable Speaker, my second question is from Lyndall, who lives in Waratah. Lyndall asked the Parliament: will the government review and improve signage and line markings on the Murchison Highway on the entry to Waratah?


Bridgewater - Bus Transport to Schools

Ms BADGER question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

My question is to the transport minister on behalf of Jack, who is a teenager in Bridgewater. Jack and his schoolmates cannot attend school on Fridays because the 5.30 a.m. Cofield to Montrose route doesn't run that morning despite operating every other day of the week. This disruption not only effects those attending schools but those who rely on public transport to get to work. Minister, what will you do to reinstate the service or if the service cannot be reinstated, will you step up, minister? What alternative measures will you put in place to ensure Jack and the other kids in Bridgewater can just get to school and not miss out on vital education?

Time expired.


ANSWER TO QUESTION

[11.50 a.m.]
Mrs ARCHER (Bass - Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing) - Honourable Speaker, I'd like to add to my previous answer in response to the question from the member for Clark in relation to the breast screening bus. I can advise that while an order has not yet been placed, the department is in the final stages of the procurement process. I commit to updating the member once this process is finalised.

The department's advice is that this will take another 12 months due to the limited availability for the fit-out of the mobile screening units across the country. However, as I said earlier, I have made it clear to the department that they must do everything possible to expedite this timeframe, and I can assure the member and Tasmanians that if it can be on the road sooner than the 12 months it will be.

DEPUTY CHAIRS OF COMMITTEES - APPOINTMENT

The SPEAKER - Pursuant to standing order 14, I hereby nominate the honourable member for Bass, Mr Fairs MP, the honourable member for Lyons, Mr Mitchell MP, and the honourable member for Bass, Professor Razay MP, to act as Deputy Chairs of Committees in the absence of, or when requested to do so by the Chair of Committees. 


SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS

Debate Motion Forthwith

[11.53 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of Government Business) - Honourable Speaker. I move -

That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent a motion concerning committees from being debated forthwith.

Motion agreed to.


MOTION

Committees - Establishment

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of Government Business) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the House. I move - 

The motion in relation to the establishment of the committees be circulated. 

I simply thank everybody for their cooperation that we've come to this landing without the need for ballots.

[11.54 a.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I reiterate that thanks to everyone involved with negotiating for members of committees and acknowledge the very important work that is conducted by standing, sessional and select committees across this parliament, and thank the Leader of Government Business.

I omitted in my contribution on the Standing Orders debate to also thank Nic Street for the work he has done working with me as Leader of Opposition Business, as well as the Greens and the crossbench, in coming to agreements on not only the Standing Orders but also these committees.

Labor members very much look forward to participating in the work of committees. I note that this motion re-establishes Committee B, which had the responsibility for the ADHD committee. I know that members who have been appointed or reappointed to that committee are looking forward to continuing that work. On that note, I want to acknowledge the work of former member for Clark, Simon Behrakis, who established the work of that committee. I know that members are looking forward to continuing that work, albeit without him here.

I did want to just pick up on a comment the Leader of Greens Business, Vica Bayley, made in his contribution on the Standing Orders debate about the library committee. I understood that the library committee was to be disbanded and was of the understanding that the work of that committee was to be collapsed into the work of the House committee. I wasn't aware that there was advice from the Clerks that that can't happen and that the House committee is unable to take on the work that previously sat in the library committee. I know that committee didn't terribly regularly, but nonetheless, I think as individual members we all highly value the work of the library staff, all of the library staff who assist us in our day-to-day work, and particularly the research service that provides invaluable support to members across the Chamber. I don't know if there's capacity for the Leader of Government Business to speak again on this motion but it would be great to have some clarification about the work of the library committee.

[11.56 a.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I echo the sentiment and thank everybody for their collaboration and cooperation on this. It's obviously a very logical step to reinstate every single committee that had prior to the parliament being prorogued, so it's welcome to see this motion being brought forward here. I again acknowledge Mr Street for his work in this regard.

Upfront, I acknowledge the work of the parliamentary staff as well and the secretariat support that will be provided to these committees. There's a really heavy committee load here. We have to be cognisant of that and recognise that for every one of these committees, there's a power of work done by parliamentary staff to make it function and enable us to do our work effectively and efficiently. Thank you to all of you.

There's obviously a couple of inquiries that are getting pretty close to reporting. I sit on mine in relation to bullying, there's the ADHD one that the Leader of Opposition business just mentioned and I understand they will be re-established when the administration committees are re-established, so that is very welcome and I look forward to getting back onto those committees and concluding our work.

There's a couple of important committees that we understand are going to be stood up at the end of the week in relation to the ending of greyhound racing and a really important committee about family violence. We look forward to seeing that on Thursday and debating that. It may not be a short debate but it will be a debate, so we look forward to that. We have also raised the issue of the Public Accounts Committee and the fact that it has yet to be updated to reflect the new numbers of the House, the expanded crossbench and the fact that we're now 35 members and not 25 members, so I flag again that that needs to happen. It is really important that that committee reflects the numbers that we have here. We understand there's a process to go through there but we look forward to that happening at some point. 

With that, I say good luck to all of the members who are being reappointed or appointed to these committees. Some of you have some catching up to do, the rest of us have some finishing off to do and I look forward to participating in that going forward. 

[11.58 a.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, my comments will be brief so I will remain here. As other colleagues have done, I also want to reiterate my thanks to Mr Street for coordinating the collection of these committees and also note, particularly for the new members of this place, that we have quite extensive committee work and that has been made possible through the expansion of the parliament to 35 members. It is really important policy work where we can come together as members of the House and work on some very difficult issues in a collaborative way, so it is a very important part of what we do in this place.

I also want to make brief mention of those people who have been witnesses to many of these committees and have been very patient with the parliament in terms of providing their submissions. Some time ago we were getting to the report-writing stage with a number of these committees, as has been noted previously, and then we've had the parliament prorogued whilst we went to an election. I want to reassure those people, as I am sure those committees will do, that their submissions and the evidence they provide those communities are valuable and the parliament does appreciate them and we look forward to continuing our important work in these areas.

[11.59 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of Government Business) - Honourable Speaker, I will briefly sum up and reiterate the thanks of others to Nic Street. The press gallery at the moment is empty, but in fairness - wait a minute -

Members interjecting.

Mr ABETZ - There are two. Certain people are suited to jobs and they should not be disqualified simply by the fact that they have formally served in this place. I would reflect - 

Members interjecting.

Mr ABETZ - No, no, no, I am reflecting on our friends in the media in relation to that. I think what we have heard around the Chamber is that Nic Street has done an exceptionally good job as a staffer in his role.

Members - Hear, hear.

Mr ABETZ - It's a cheap shot from time to time to talk about former members of parliament - I was one for a while. I think it's a matter for mature consideration by the media and others to simply ask the question, is the person qualified for the particular job and should it be a disqualification simply because they have previously served in this place? I think common sense tells us what the answer to that is. 

I understand that there might be some disgruntlement in relation to the non-establishment of the library committee, which is a shameless power grab by the Greens, but what I will say to Mr Bayley and all members is that if the will of the House is that that committee be re-established, so be it.

With that said, I commend the motion to the House.

Motion agreed to.


SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS

Inaugural Speeches

[12.02 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of Government Business) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent - 

the question before the Chair at 1 p.m. today from automatically standing adjourned; and 

 the following members from making a statement to the House commencing at 2.30 p.m. for a period not exceeding 30 minutes each:

The honourable member for Bass, Mrs Green.

The honourable member for Franklin, Mr George

The honourable member for Braddon, Mr Pearce

The honourable member for Bass, Prof Razay

The honourable member for Lyons, Mr Di Falco

The honourable member for Bass, Mrs Archer

The honourable member for Lyons, Mr Mitchell

Just in case people are wondering, they'll have to wait for Mr Vermey's.

Motion agreed to.


MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Government for Tasmanians

[12.03 a.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House take note of the following matter: Government for Tasmanians

I am very keen to get to the lectern to address this matter of public importance: Government for Tasmanians. To some of the comments from the Leader of Government Business during Question Time about 'talking Tasmania down', I will say that I love Tasmania, and I will talk Tasmania up. I think what the honourable member was referring to was that he would like me to give the government credit where credit is due. I can do that too; congratulations, honourable member. Your government is mediocre at the best of times.

I have spent the last couple of weeks travelling around Tasmania, a place that I love dearly. I've been to the north three times, a place where I grew up and a place that helped shape me. I've been to the west coast, I've been to the north-west coast, I've been to the east coast all the way up to St Helens, and I've been down south to Geeveston. I've engaged with farmers, tourism operators, transport workers, scientists, local government representatives, emergency service personnel, people who work in productive industries, childcare, the renewable energy sector and hospitality, and small business owners. They've all been very generous with their time. I've really appreciated their commitment to our great state and I value the contribution they are making to our economy. There are great Tasmanians doing wonderful things all over our state.

I will talk Tasmania up, but that's not to be confused with the government. We know that members on that side get a bit sensitive at times. Tasmanians have been telling me on these journeys that they're tired of the standard of politics in Tasmania. They're tired of members of this place being prepared to say and do anything in election campaigns or post-elections to retain power.

We've been providing scrutiny in Question Time on the TasInsure policy, the flagship policy of the Liberal Party during the election. It is a very serious issue. All those people I just mentioned, Tasmanians that I engaged with, I asked them questions around insurance premiums. I met people like Scott from Scottsdale - and he is a real person, honourable Leader of the House. Scott from Scottsdale told me his insurance premiums are increasing. The cost of everything is increasing; tractors have doubled in price and so have his premiums. Tasmanians are struggling with the cost of doing business.

I met business owners that are struggling on this issue. They are struggling with their insurance premiums, whether it be their house, their car or other personal items. They want real solutions. What I'm hearing in the community is that they are very sceptical of this policy. They are concerned that it will expose Tasmanians to financial risk and that it's not thought through, it's not feasible and it can't be delivered. They are sceptical that there will be a $250 saving on their insurance premium, or that grocery prices will go down.

We've heard in Question Time that there is no evidence. The government has produced no evidence when it comes to this policy; no business case, no Treasury modelling, nothing. I think Tasmania
