The SPEAKER - As you have been notified, a Chamber session photograph is now going to be taken from the public gallery to record the 52nd Parliament. 


QUESTIONS

Education Sector - Dispute Negotiations

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[10.04 a.m.]
At a press conference on 29 October, you told the media that public sector unions should return to the negotiating table. Reporting from Seven News exposed that behind closed doors you had cancelled meetings with unions the day before you spoke to the media. Were you aware those meetings had been cancelled when you spoke to the media on 29 October?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. Of course, we're extremely disappointed by the recent action that's been taken by our unions. Negotiations don't happen in the media, and negotiations don't happen when you close schools. It's an impossible situation. We want to be at the table. We want to be having good conversations and getting to a point where our teachers feel that they are recognised and heard, but it's also affordable for our state. It was very disappointing to see that the action was taken, especially when the log of claims was only given to us - my understanding - at the end of September, and then straight into October we're preparing strike action. We wanted to have the opportunity to work through that log of claims, which I think is a reasonable expectation. 

I thank our schools that did have to leap into action to ensure that we were able to keep children safe while that industrial action was happening.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable minister still has one minute and 40 seconds to answer the question. I ask that interjections cease and allow the minister to answer the question. You can ask a supplementary question.

Ms PALMER - Thank you very much, honourable Speaker. We continue to want to negotiate with the unions and, as I said, we don't want to be negotiating through the media. We cannot negotiate while industrial action - 

Mr WILLIE - Point of order, honourable Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. My question was very specific, about whether the minister knew the meetings had been cancelled before she made a statement to the media. 

The SPEAKER - I draw the minister to the question, noting that she has a minute left to answer.

Ms PALMER - Thank you very much, honourable Speaker. We certainly want to have those discussions. We want to be at the table working through - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Allow the minister to answer the complete her answer.

Ms PALMER - meaningful way to ensure that we are able to reach a longer term agreement. Of course, I call on the unions to come back to the table -

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, honourable Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question is very clear: did the minister know before she faced the media that the meetings had been cancelled?

The SPEAKER - Honourable minister.

Ms PALMER - As I was saying, we cannot negotiate through the media. We cannot be negotiating whilst - 

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, honourable Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The minister has 10 seconds. Can she answer the question?

The SPEAKER - Thank you for your assistance. Honourable minister, I draw you back to the question. 

Ms PALMER - As I was saying, I was not aware that they had actually cancelled any formal -

The SPEAKER - The honourable minister's time has expired.


Education Sector - Dispute Negotiations

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[10.08 a.m.]
That's extraordinary. She took a long time to get to end there, but the minister has just admitted she wasn't aware. 

How can Tasmanian teachers have any faith in your government's negotiating process when they have an Education minister grandstanding in the media, completely unaware that her government had cancelled meetings behind closed doors? Why weren't you involved in the meetings? You're the Education minister.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. Let me be really clear: we got a log of claims at the end of September. It's a long log of claims. I want to work through them and I want to understand. You can't hand over a log of claims at the end of September - 

Ms Finlay - Who's running the government? 

The SPEAKER - Order, the honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

Ms PALMER - You cannot hand over a log of claims at the end of September and then go into strike action in October before you've even had the chance to work through it. My expectation is that the log of claims will be worked through, and that it will be carefully worked through. We want to see a good outcome. I am in schools every week, I want to see a great outcome here -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Interjections will cease from all sides. It will be very hard for Hansard to record the minister's answer, which I'm sure is what we are really here to listen to. I ask the minister to speak, but I remind the House that the acceptable forms of interjection are 'hear, hear,' and 'shame.'

Ms PALMER - Thank you. We want to see a great outcome here. I want to see our teachers really recognised - I'm passionate about that. I spend time in schools every week talking to them, understanding some of the complexities that they're facing. Teaching is different now; schools are different now to 10 or 20 years ago. We want to make sure that they're recognised. We can't be negotiating while schools are closed and while this strike action - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. 

Ms PALMER - We are very confident that unions are at the table and we are at the table and we want to get a good resolution.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - How can Tasmanian teachers have any faith in this government's negotiating process when the Education minister's not even involved?

The SPEAKER - I draw the minister to the question.

Ms PALMER - I tell you how the Education minister's involved: I am in schools every week. I'm talking to first-year teachers, principals - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. You asked a question; allow the minister to answer it.

Ms PALMER - And I am there on the ground with them, listening. That is what my job is. It is not my job to be in the intricacies of the negotiations. You know that, everyone in this Chamber knows that. I am on the ground, I am with our teachers, understanding - 

Mr Willie - You made a false statement to media - 

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Opposition. 

Ms PALMER - There was no false statement. 

The SPEAKER - Before we move to the next question, I remind the House that you ask the question, you then allow the minister to answer the questions. I will start giving out warnings. I don't want to see any member have to leave the Chamber, but I ask that you show mutual respect and that if you ask a question - and you want to know what the answer is - to please allow the minister to respond to the question. Remember, they have three minutes to respond. 


State Budget - Austerity Measures

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.12 a.m.]
Essential public sector workers have been denied a fair pay deal for pay and conditions by your government. Teachers and nurses are being forced into industrial action to get fair compensation. Funding is being stripped from community services that support Tasmanians living hand-to-mouth. From the Chigwell Community Garden, all the Neighbourhood Houses and family violence services, millions are being clawed back from those who need it most. TasTAFE arts and lab-tech courses are on the chopping block, the number of Tasmanians on the housing and elective surgery waiting lists are only growing. This is just the beginning of the Rockliff government's stadium austerity era. 

As you bleed dry the essential services Tasmanians rely on to pay for a stadium, do you admit that austerity is the new reality under your government and is a choice that you are actively making? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. I object the premise of the question because we have to get the balance right. If you want to talk about austerity, I take you back to when the Labor-Greens government -

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Labor-Greens disaster, thank you, Ms Dow, because you were cutting public servants across the board, particularly those frontline public servants - hardworking nurses, for example, you closed wards, put hospital beds in storage, and you sacked a nurse today for nine months.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Honourable members of the opposition, you get to ask another question soon. I ask that the Premier is heard. Feel free to use the words 'shame' or 'hear, hear' if you ever felt that need, but allow the Premier to respond in silence please. He still has two minutes to respond. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, honourable Speaker. I'm just providing some context to what austerity really is. Austerity was the fact back in 2010, particularly the 2011 budget.

What we are about in our budget is getting the balance right: continuing to invest in community services, particularly investing in the community services and organisations that are supporting vulnerable Tasmanians. I recognise that times continue to be tough for many Tasmanians. That is why we need to continue to grow our economy, including investing in enabling infrastructure, such as stadia infrastructure and other infrastructure across Tasmania.

We will be making balanced decisions that support strong budget management, given the circumstances we are in, but never forgetting or leaving behind vulnerable Tasmanians. What I am pleased with is that we maintain a good economy. We still have record low unemployment that is the lowest in the nation, which is all about supporting Tasmanians into work and ensuring they can have a positive contribution to our community across this state.

I reject your austerity tag. I can see why you are doing it; because you are playing politics with the Mac Point stadium, so I understand the politics of the situation from your point of view. However, we're getting the balance right, investing in essential services. You mentioned public service pay rise - we want to sit down and negotiate in good faith.

I was standing here three years ago, receiving questions from yourself, honourable member for Franklin -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time has expired.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - The Premier said that he will never leave vulnerable Tasmanians behind. For four months, Neighbourhood Houses have not received Community Connector funding for people who're working with the most vulnerable Tasmanians. This is the clawing back that is happening now. Do you accept it's a decision you're making to introduce a stadium instead of funding essential services into the future? That's what it will mean.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I reject that. In fact, my view is that it's stadium prosperity, not stadium austerity.

Dr Woodruff - It's a fact of what's happening.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You actually enable infrastructure that creates an economy so you can fund the essential services that you speak of. I reject what you've just claimed.

Dr Woodruff - Four months and they haven't got their money - Neighbourhood houses.

The SPEAKER - Order. Dr Woodruff, you've asked a question, allow the Premier to answer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Because you called an election. You both blocked the budget and forced an election. That's why.

Mr Bayley - You called the election, you're the Premier.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Any delays are on the heads - 

Dr Woodruff - We did not. You're holding money back.

The SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff, you have asked a question, allow the Premier to answer, please.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Any delays - we wanted the budget passed back in June this year, but you combined to force an election. What I'm looking forward to is continuing to support our community sector and invest in essential services that Tasmanians care about.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Premier's time has expired.

Public Service Wage Negotiations

Mr O'BYRNE question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[10.18 a.m.]
Your government is engaged in protracted and increasingly bitter negotiations with public sector workers. In the media today, you are quoted as saying, 'The state cannot afford the log of claims presented to you by unions on behalf of their members.' The reality is that you cannot afford to not provide an offer that deals with the workload issues and meets the fair conditions and pay our dedicated public sector workers deserve. I appreciate that given the state of the budget, you cannot write a blank cheque. However, you will need to deal with the real and pressing concerns raised through these negotiations. Isn't it time that you sat at the table and worked harder to find a resolution?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. Yes, we have negotiations being undertaken and, as is the want with negotiations, certain ambit claims are made. I saw figures the other day, if all the claims were to be accepted, the Tasmanian taxpayer would, over the forward Estimates, have to pay more than the total cost of the new stadium that is being proposed. They're the sorts of figures that we are looking at in relation to that which are being proposed.

It stands to reason, I would have thought, for any Tasmanian taxpayer to say, 'Let's have a negotiation about that. What's being asked for is clearly unaffordable.' That is why I, on behalf of the government, made the statement that I did.

The unions and the government have to come to the negotiating table and continue to undertake the discussions

Mr Rockliff - Good faith negotiations, that's right.

Mr ABETZ - As the Premier has just rightly interjected, we need good faith negotiations. With respect, those good faith negotiations don't take place by giving a pre-brief to the media, so you can get a front page headline. It is not undertaken by peddling issues which are clearly not achievable - raising workers' expectations that cannot be delivered, and that must be understood.

What we do need is good faith negotiation. That is what the government has embarked upon - will continue to embark upon - because we are grateful for the work that our public service does. They are entitled to a fair pay increase to have an acceptable pay rate.

Mr Mitchell - What about the 2500 you want to sack?

Mr ABETZ - I take Mr Mitchell's interjection. I remember a former Labor treasurer, Mr Frank Crean - albeit not in today's language - telling the Australian people in relation to wage increases that the Canberra Public Service was seeking that 'one man's pay rise is another man's job.' In today's language, we would say one public servant's pay rise may well represent another public servant's job.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ABETZ - Our task as a government is to get that balance right. Isn't it amazing, the interjections you get when you quote a former distinguished Labor treasurer from Canberra? They cannot accept the logic of their own side of politics. What I would simply say to Mr O'Byrne - I am willing to sit at any table -

The SPEAKER - The honourable Treasurer's time has expired.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Potential Gambling Sponsorship

Ms JOHNSTON question to MINISTER for MACQUARIE POINT URBAN RENEWAL, Mr ABETZ

[10.22 a.m.]
Tasmanians are being asked to take on the massive financial burden of Macquarie Point stadium. They should not also be asked to bear the damaging social costs of gambling advertising. Have you, your government, or to your knowledge, has Macquarie Point Development Corporation held, encouraged or been made aware of any discussions or approaches from gambling companies regarding sponsorship, naming rights, advertising or logo placement at the stadium or with the Tasmania Devils AFL/AFLW teams? If so, will you disclose who held the discussions, when they were held, and what was discussed? If not, will you rule out gambling sponsorship?

ANSWER

In relation to the first question, the answer is no, but in the event that representations have been made that I'm not aware of, I will come back to the House. 

In relation to future potential activities, I'm not going to rule anything in or out, and we, as a government, Stadiums Tasmania, et cetera, will consider each and every request on its merits. 

I confess, gambling activity is something that I don't engage in -

Mr Winter - Melbourne Cup? Jeez.

Mr ABETZ - other than possibly the odd Melbourne Cup, but I won't even be fluttering today because I'm putting the finishing touches to a budget, Mr Winter. 

Mr Winter - The race that stops the nation - except Eric Abetz. 

Mr ABETZ - What I can say is that we are actively concerned about the issues of gambling within our community and we are monitoring it exceptionally closely. 

The SPEAKER - Just to clarify, Treasurer, you will take the first part of the question on notice?

Mr ABETZ - Speaker, only if I am informed that others have had approaches made to them. The question was to me: no approaches have been made to me personally, but if others have - and I will make enquiries - if there's more to report, I most definitely will.


Education Sector - Industrial Action

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[10.24 a.m.]
You say you are listening to teachers, but you are losing control of your portfolio. From your failure to consult with your workforce on the rollout of your pet multi-schools project, to education facility attendants taking industrial action because their resource allocation hasn't been updated since 1997. Now, we're seeing teachers taking industrial action because your government hasn't been engaging with them in good faith. What message does it send thousands of teachers and education staff who just want decent conditions for student learning that your government will cancel meetings and then publicly blame them for not negotiating?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. Look, let's be really clear here - and I actually mean this in a very genuine way - I'm not sure you understand how the wage negotiations work. 

Mr Willie - Don't patronise me.

Ms PALMER - I'm not trying to patronise you. I'm not the negotiator. Wage negotiations are done at arm's length from me.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The minister is trying to provide a response.

Ms PALMER - My job as Education minister is not to be in that space. That is done through the wage negotiator. I have to lay that out on the table first. 

I want a great outcome here. I want a good outcome here. I have been working with the unions. I have met with the unions. I have listened and I have absolutely taken on board what they have said, and I have fed that information back through the appropriate channels, which is what I believe my role as Education minister is.

I am on the ground with our teachers. I understand the workload and the pressures they've been under, which is why over 12 months ago we began a huge body of work really looking at making school time count and how we can reduce the workload of our teachers. We've been looking at how we streamline forms and processes so that we're bringing different systems into one place.

We've been looking at how we reduce teacher administration tasks relating to student attendances. We've been looking at how we can make it easier to meet compliance through reporting requirements. We've looked at how we can reduce the amount of time that's spent in school staff meetings. We are on this. I know this is important, and we started work on this long before these negotiations started. I want to see a change here. 

You refer to multi-school organisations. Everything about that reform is changing an education system to ensure that we are reducing the administrative workload on our principals, and giving teachers the opportunity to be in the classroom, front and centre, with students, not back at their desks, not working on weekends, not working after school, filling in admin papers.

 [Bookmark: Phr1_O=0.3_D=18.0_C=0.82] We are absolutely in this space with our teachers, our principals and our schools for great outcomes for our kids. If we were looking at incredible outcomes in the data we wouldn't be doing  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=19.1_D=29.3_C=0.85] this, but we're not. We have had some great reforms and some great opportunities, lifting literacy. We can see the change that is making, but we need to make sure that we have a whole-of-education system reform. Teaching isn't just about teachers. It is not just happening in our schools. Communities have to be on board. Families have to be on board. Early learning for three-year-olds has to be thriving, and we have to see our department properly framed up to support that.

The SPEAKER - The honourable minister's time has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=48.5_D=14.5_C=0.78] Mr WILLIE - How does cancelling meetings and blaming teachers and education staff restore trust or get negotiations back on track?

The SPEAKER - That was part of the original question, minister.

Mr Willie - She blamed them in the media.

The SPEAKER - Order. Allow the minister to respond.

Ms PALMER -  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=76.0_D=9.2_C=0.82] The decision to cancel meetings was taken by the wage negotiator.

Mr Willie - You would have been across that as minister.

Ms PALMER - My issue is with the union's decision [Bookmark: Phr6_O=86.0_D=29.9_C=0.76] , not with teachers.

Mr Willie - They represent teachers. 

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Opposition.

Ms PALMER - And I have asked the union to come back to the table and negotiate in good faith.

Members interjecting. 

The SPEAKER - Order. 


Macquarie Point Stadium - Cost and Debt

Mr BAYLEY question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[10.29 a.m.]
Throughout your career you have been consistent in pursuing sweeping public sector cuts. As federal employment minister you advocated for and delivered job cuts across Australia. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=116.3_D=29.8_C=0.80]  After your election last year, you made it clear it was your mission here too. Your consistency on job cuts will continue in this Budget, but unfortunately you have become somewhat hypocritical on debt. 

In your inaugural speech here you described leaving debt legacies for the next generation as 'intergenerational theft and selfishness writ large.' You said, 'all government priorities will need to be set based on genuine necessity.' Yet here you are prioritising a single project that will add $2 billion to our small state's [Bookmark: Phr8_O=146.2_D=15.6_C=0.87]  existing enormous debt. Treasurer, how can you possibly support the stadium given your strong views on debt? Do you believe a third AFL stadium is a genuine necessity, and what happened to your sense of responsibility for future generations?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=164.2_D=12.3_C=0.81] Honourable Speaker, I commend the honourable member and recommend to everybody in this Chamber and elsewhere to read my first speech, and I congratulate him for doing so. I also indicate to him that there might be [Bookmark: Phr10_O=176.9_D=24.6_C=0.87]  some other speeches I may have given, and if you have some spare time, I would say to the member for Clark, you can bury yourself in those as well. 

In relation to my consistency in public life, thank you for acknowledging that. I am of the view, in general terms, that small government is the best government. I happen to believe that [Bookmark: Phr11_O=202.3_D=5.8_C=0.78]  the average punter knows how to spend their money a bit better than Hobart or Canberr [Bookmark: Phr12_O=209.2_D=26.3_C=0.82] a does, and therefore I try to keep everything within reasonable parameters. 

In relation to the stadium, I simply make this point, and the Premier did it exceptionally well: the stadium will be of assistance for a pathway to prosperity for this state. There is no doubt that this is going to be intergenerational [Bookmark: Phr13_O=235.8_D=0.9_C=0.96]  investment [Bookmark: Phr14_O=237.3_D=29.8_C=0.83] . I know what the polls tell us, but interestingly enough, in the younger demographic in particular there is huge support, so when this government goes about building the infrastructure for the future, we are in fact doing that which the younger cohort within our community is expecting and wanting us to do. They know and realise that over the lifetime of a stadium that might go for about [Bookmark: Phr15_O=267.3_D=29.9_C=0.80]  50 years or so, they will be a contribution that they will be making over the lifetime of the stadium, and there will be all those benefits from the stadium, the economic enabling. Even when the Hobart City Council commissioned a report, it found that there would be $170-something millions of extra economic activity within the Hobart City Council boundaries. What does the Lord [Bookmark: Phr16_O=297.5_D=7.5_C=0.62]  Mayor say, Madam Speaker? -

Dr Woodruff - It's only going to last for 30 years and we will be paying a debt for 100.

The SPEAKER - Order, honourable Leader of the Greens, allow the Treasurer to answer the question please.

Mr ABETZ - Ignore that because it's inconvenient, so the Lord Mayor says, 'Slide that aside, it's inconvenient.' Well, we happen to believe that this stadium will not only be an economic enabler, it will be a social enabler, a cultural enabler, and it will provide an iconic gateway to our capital city. 

This is going to be transformative and over the forward Estimates, the $375 million that we will be putting in by way of an equity injection, is, in general terms, 37 days, 38 days of health expenditure in this state. 

The SPEAKER - The honourable Treasurer's time has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr BAYLEY - The Treasurer talked about the pathway to prosperity, but Treasury advice was clear that you can't grow yourself out of the current problem. I asked the Treasurer about his responsibility to future generations, given his speech and calling debt legacies 'intergenerational theft and selfishness writ large,' so I ask again, what happened to your sense of responsibility to those future generations?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Treasurer. 

Mr ABETZ - Speaker, what the honourable member needs to understand is the difference between operational expenditure and capital expenditure. Capital expenditure and making an investment in capital -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ABETZ - is order in general terms, good expenditure. Having to borrow for that, as most of us do or have done for our house mortgage, is similar. But if you have to borrow for the operational expenditure of your household, then you've got some issues. That is what we have recognised. What the honourable member is doing - and I know he's intelligent enough to know the difference - for political purposes, I suspect, he's trying to conflate operational expenditure with capital expenditure. He knows that to be disingenuous and he knows better.


TasTAFE - Funding Cuts

Prof RAZAY question to MINISTER for SKILLS and JOBS, Mr ELLIS 

[10.35 a.m.]
There is deep concern in the community about the decision to remove funding for TasTAFE 12 vocational programs, including the visual art, design, music, screen and media, fashion and textiles, and also the laboratory technology. These programs have provided vital training for the Tasmanian workforce for several decades. 

National research confirmed critical shortages of skilled workers that these defunded programs are specifically designed to address. Removing this training program will limit opportunity for youth and women in regional areas who face compounded barriers to access education and economic opportunities. With nearly half of our youth dropout after year 10, and the critical shortages of skilled workers, how does the government plan to encourage young people to keep studying and continue locally?

The SPEAKER - The honourable member's time has expired. 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank Prof Razay for his interest in this really important matter. More broadly, we want to ensure that we deliver training that delivers great outcomes for our young people. That's why we've invested so significantly in TasTAFE right across the skills sector. 

There are some areas where it's important that we are making better investments than we are currently. Where we have courses that have very high dropout rates and very low completion rates; that's not good for the learner, that's not good for TAFE as an institution, and it's not good for the taxpayer. Where we have very low numbers in some of these courses that are unsustainably low, less than a handful of people completing those courses -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ELLIS - Less than a handful of people completing some of these courses. That's not sustainable for an organisation like TAFE. We're looking to provide a smarter way of delivering the support for learners in that. 

A classic example is the Meat Inspectors course that is on the list of 12. Meat inspection is, broadly speaking, delivered by a specialised training institution, Response Training, who work closely with industry, have great relationships right across the meat processing sector in our state. They deliver the bulk of the training. TAFE duplicates their work and doesn't do it particularly well. We've had less than a handful of learners graduate through our meat inspectors course at TAFE, whereas we have much stronger results through response training.

Mr Mitchell - Tell us about lab-tech.

Mr ELLIS - It's a similar case with lab-tech as well, where we've seen very high dropout rates for the lab-tech training that we provide in TasTAFE. 

Mr Mitchell - The full-fee diploma, not on the Cert 4.

The SPEAKER - The honourable member for Lyons can ask his own question soon, thank you.

Mr ELLIS - More than 50 per cent, about a 60 per cent projected dropout rate and -

Mr Mitchell - He's misleading the House.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ELLIS - It is true, Speaker, where we have a 60 per cent drop out rate through some of our lab-tech courses, where we have less than a handful of people actually completing those courses. We also have specialist training providers who provide training in people's workplaces right across Tasmania through LabTech Training, which is the specialised training provider.

More broadly on some of the arts courses that you mentioned before. Our government is a strong supporter of the arts, but it's also important that when we're providing training we do so in a way that delivers great completion rates, low dropout rates and really good job outcomes. Some of these courses have a 75 per cent dropout rate. That's not good for those learners. It's not good for TAFE as an institution. It's not good for the Tasmanian taxpayer -

Mr Willie - Keep devaluing them and their contribution. I'm sure they're thrilled about it.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ELLIS - Whereas, if we're able to support, just as in the other courses, specialised training organisations that deliver great training, that are closely aligned with the arts community, then we'll get the best outcome. You don't need to take my word for it as a good approach. If you look at, for example -

Education Sector - Wage Dispute

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[10.39 a.m.]
The Premier already broke faith with workers once this year to cling to power with the Greens' support. Despite signing letters of support and giving industries his word that the Liberal Party would support them, the Premier sold them out to appease the Greens. Minister, Tasmanian workers don't believe you have their back. Treasurer Abetz has already threatened the workforce with more sackings if there is to be a wage increase above the government's ultimatum. Is that the only thing Tasmania can believe from your government: that Treasurer Abetz will sack teachers and education staff if they don't comply with your ultimatum?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable opposition leader for the question. Let me be really clear. We want a good outcome here. It's what we want. It's what I want. It's what our government wants. It's what our unions and our teachers want. We need to be at the table having those conversations, which is far more - the media talks so much about the three per cent, but it's more than that. It's about the circumstances in which our schools are functioning and the way that we support our teachers, the way that we support our principals, and we need to be at the table having those conversations.

Let me be really clear, when it comes to our schools, we're actually out there trying to recruit more social workers, trying to recruit more speech pathologists. We are out there looking at what the school of today needs and who the people are that we need in there. We're trying to find people from across Australia, Canada, other countries to ensure that we have the allied health professionals in our schools.

Mr Mitchell - You've been here 11 years and you've started now. 

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable member for Lyons, your voice is very loud.

Ms PALMER - I get what you're trying to do, but the fact is that we are trying to get a great outcome. We want our schools to succeed. I want to be in our schools talking to our teachers, talking to our principals, understanding what their workload is and how through these negotiations, we can make sure that we have a great outcome, not just for their wallet, which is important, but for the way that they can enjoy teaching. We want kids to be in love with learning and we want teachers to be in love with teaching, and they're the sort of conversations that need to be had at the table.

Supplementary Question 

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Will the education minister sack workers if they don't comply with the government's ultimatum, as per the comments of the Treasurer?

The SPEAKER - That does refer to the original question, minister.

Mr O'Byrne - 'One man's pay rise is another man's job' - you said it.

Mr Abetz - Yes - Frank Crean, Labor. Labor.

Mr O'Byrne - You repeated it.

Mr Abetz - You don't like Labor, do you? 

The SPEAKER - Order. Allow the minister to answer the question, please, Treasurer.

Ms PALMER - We've been quite clear - well, I've certainly been quite clear - that this is not about frontline workers. We need our teachers to be teaching and we want them in our schools. We have seen record investment when you look at the number of teachers that we have in schools, the number of teacher assistants, the professional support staff, the speech pathologists, the social workers, the school psychologists, the school nurses, the school administration staff, the education support specialists. We are building an extraordinary workforce. I'm so proud of them and I love spending time with them and learning from them. We are trying to build a workforce to teach our children into the future, and that's what I'm committed to.


Salmon Mass Mortality Event - Code of Practice

Mr GEORGE question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Mr PEARCE

[10.44 a.m.]
Yesterday's report on what the government learned - or, in fact, didn't learn - from last summer's shocking mass mortality event in which a million farmed salmon died in south-eastern waters, with rotting salmon flesh and fat washing up on the beaches, highlights the necessity for a serious and in-depth inquiry into the industry. With summer and warming waters approaching, urgent action is needed to prevent a recurrence and to hold the multinational owners to account. Yet the government's report suggests the industry lobby, Salmon Tasmania, merely 'consider' a code of practice, and that's not good enough. Will the government urgently insist on, or impose, a code of practice that pulls the industry into line, ensures public accountability and doesn't simply rely on dumping ever more antibiotics into our waterways to keep its diseased fish alive?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable independent member for Franklin for his question and intense interest in this subject. The independent study, terms of reference and promulgation - the process that we've just gone through - involves consultation around an industry that is absolutely vitally important for Tasmania and Tasmania's future. This is an industry that is worth as much as our dairy industry and our beef industry combined, an industry that employs thousands of Tasmanians and puts food on tables. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable minister has over two minutes. I do ask that he is heard, please. 

Mr PEARCE - This is an industry that strives for continual improvement and this is a government that supports that. 

The salmon industry, as I said, is a significant contributor to Tasmania's economy, providing jobs and prosperity for many regional communities. It's essential that we have regulatory environments and frameworks that are effective in enabling that sustainability and development, protecting the state's marine and environment both in fresh and saltwater.

The government's decision to commission an independent salmon study that benchmarks our regulation against world's best practice does not diminish our support for the industry. In fact, it reinforces our commitment to its long-term sustainability, underpinned by robust environmental standards. We want practical reforms that protect our environment, that provide investment security and certainty so that Tasmania -

Mr GEORGE - Point of order, honourable Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. I ask the minister to be relevant to the question, which is asking about a code of practice for the industry in time for summer. He has not addressed that at all in two and a half minutes.

The SPEAKER - Thank you for the point of order. Honourable minister, I draw you back to the original question.

Mr PEARCE - Certainly. As I was explaining to the House, this independent study and the terms of reference are designed to formulate and gather the scientific data and the feedback so that we can improve our regulatory framework around this great industry. It measures and it protects those vital elements that I talked about earlier. This study will enable stakeholders to focus on transparency -

The SPEAKER - The honourable minister's time has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr GEORGE - A supplementary question, honourable Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr GEORGE - I asked about the code of practice referred to in the report from yesterday, calling, in its own words, 'To outline timely removal of mortalities, prevent further disease outbreaks and get environmentally responsible management.' This needs to happen before the summer outbreak of new disease. Will you impose a code of practice to make sure the industry is held accountable and the public knows it's being held accountable?

The SPEAKER - A code of practice and accountability does draw back to the original question.

Mr PEARCE - In terms of accountability and a code of practice, of course that is why we are conducting this study. Of course that is why we need that consultative process so that we can scientifically build that robust, regulatory framework around that. To that end, industry has already been proactive in taking steps -

Members interjecting.

Mr PEARCE - The industry does not want to see another mass mortality event -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. There are too many interjection, which makes it impossible for Hansard to be able to record the minister's answer accurately. I ask that the minister be heard in silence.

Mr PEARCE - Of course there will be frameworks that are reinforced by this study; that's the entire reason for the study. It isn't, however, the case that everybody involved in the consultative process of that study receives 100 per cent of what they want. If everybody received 100 per cent of what they want, no-one would receive anything. That's where we're at with this study - scientific basis for regulatory frameworks.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time has expired. 


Macquarie Point Stadium - Cost and Debt

Ms BURNET question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[10.50 a.m.]
Treasury's response to the Planning Commission's damning rejection of the stadium says the stadium will increase the state's debt, but this debt should be paid off within the life of the stadium's asset. In the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) last week, the government's Coordinator-General said of the stadium that, in his view, there's no reason why the government needs to repay the capital. In his view, it's perfectly acceptable for Tasmanians to pay up to $70 million a year on interest on the stadium without paying off the debt. It's bad enough you're willing to put the state in debt to pay off this vanity project over its lifetime, but it's unthinkable to put Tasmanians on the hook for tens of millions of dollars a year with no end in sight. Tell us, Treasurer, how much will it cost Tasmanians to service the stadium debt each and every year?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, what I can say to the honourable member is that it is unthinkable that Tasmanians would forgo a $600 million injection into our economy courtesy of the federal Labor government and the AFL. If we don't go ahead with that stadium, $600 million that was coming our way will not be coming our way. That to me is unthinkable.

For us to be able to get that $600 million to come our way, guess what? We've got to make our contribution as well. That is not an unreasonable proposition, I would have thought, for the average person trying to think through the issues. Will there be debt involved? Of course there will be, but if you took that sort of approach you would never borrow money to make money. That is what those of us that have been in business do - you borrow money, with the anticipation that the business will make money to be able to service the debt. This is a project that will -

Ms BURNET - Point of order, honourable Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question was: how much will it cost Tasmanians to service the stadium debt each and every year?

The SPEAKER - That does refer back to the original question.

Mr ABETZ - If you were to ask that same question about your house mortgage, it will vary.

Ms Burnet - We're talking about the stadium.

Mr ABETZ - We are talking about a stadium. Can I let you in on a bit of a secret? When you borrow money, and especially government, you roll over the bonds for borrowing about every five years - they are renewed - and that then depends on the pressures on the market for borrowings, interest rates, et cetera.

Mr Willie - Credit rating.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ABETZ - Credit rating is  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=32.3_D=3.7_C=0.65] another issue, and I take the interjection [Bookmark: Phr4_O=36.8_D=24.7_C=0.76]  of the Leader of the Opposition. It tells us it is a multi-factorial issue about which you ask, and to ask me what it is going to be in five- or ten-years' time, it is like with a house mortgage. When interest rates go up, there is an extra burden on households. When interest rates go down it is a bit easier [Bookmark: Phr5_O=61.5_D=4.7_C=0.83]  for households. Therefore, if you were to ask the average household, can you say [Bookmark: Phr6_O=66.5_D=27.6_C=0.78]  to the exact dollar and cent how much you will be paying on your mortgage each and every year, the answer is that it cannot be determined because of all those variations. 

Similarly, not surprisingly, it is with the stadium. But what I can assure the member for Clark and indeed all those who are interested in this, that it is all serviceable and within the budget. 

The SPEAKER - The honourable Treasurer's time has expired. 

Supplementary Question.

Ms BURNET - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms BURNET - The government said that you could provide the most up-to-date costs of this stadium before the vote. Clearly the cost of debt servicing is a part of these costs. What advice are you going to get from Treasury and are you going to bring that back to the House in relation to servicing that debt?

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=117.5_D=24.3_C=0.87] Mr ABETZ - I think I have already indicated to the honourable member the difficulties in getting the exact figures. It is like with any borrowings, interest rates go up and down, things that are beyond our control, and Treasury has given advice and indeed will continue to give advice [Bookmark: Phr10_O=142.6_D=4.0_C=0.80]  and in relation to that. In relation to that, there will be the opportunity at [Bookmark: Phr11_O=147.1_D=18.7_C=0.80]  the Estimates very shortly where the honourable member can ask Treasury about those issues.

Salmon Industry - Independent Review
 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=171.8_D=9.9_C=0.87] 
Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Mr PEARCE

[10.55 a.m.]
On Monday 27 October, you released the terms of reference for the Independent Salmon Review. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=182.4_D=13.6_C=0.89]  Then, on the morning of Thursday 30 October, the Leader of the Tasmanian Greens posted on social media that she had spoken and then written to the Premier asking for a change to those terms of reference. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=197.2_D=13.2_C=0.87]  Then just a few hours later, your government released drastically changed terms of reference for the review. Who made the change to the terms of reference? Was it you, the Premier [Bookmark: Phr16_O=211.3_D=6.4_C=0.56] , or the Leader of the Greens? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=228.7_D=11.3_C=0.76]  The government's decision to commission an independent salmon study will benchmark the regulations against the world's best practice. That doesn't diminish our support for the industry, as I said earlier. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=243.4_D=14.8_C=0.80]  What we wanted to do was to work and identify and engage suitably qualified off-island experts to lead a study that is now underway, and that train is about to leave the station.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The opposition has asked a question. I ask that the minister be heard. He still has over two minutes to respond.

Mr PEARCE - Thank you, Speaker. In terms of the consultative process that was undertaken by our government where we listened to all involved and formulated terms of reference around [Bookmark: Phr21_O=280.0_D=24.1_C=0.81]  that.

Ms Finlay - That you issued publicly and then changed? 

The SPEAKER - The honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition, this is your first warning for constant interjections. I have asked that the minister be heard. This is your first warning. 

Mr PEARCE - That probably illustrates the point I'm trying to make, and that is what consultation means. That means sometimes you speak and sometimes you listen. That's what we've tried to do. We've consulted, we've listened, we've compromised and we've come up with the middle ground and that's exactly what we are doing.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. I ask the opposition to allow the minister to answer the question, please.

Mr PEARCE - We stand by that, Speaker. We stand by that statement that we have consulted widely. We have considered all input into that, as I explained in my previous question. No one gets 100 per cent of everything that they want, and sometimes we need to reconsider those inputs. 

The terms of reference have now been formulated, they've been finalised. That train, as I said, will leave the station very shortly. I suggest you get on it.

Members interjecting.

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, honourable Speaker - I'm on it, minister - who made the decision? Who changed the terms -  

The SPEAKER - Is this your supplementary question? 

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - The minister has taken his seat.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Are you going to come back and respond to the question? Have you finished your answer?

Mr Pearce - Yes.

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question was: who made the change to the terms of reference, you, the Premier, or the Leader of the Greens?

The SPEAKER - The minister has taken his seat. I suggest the honourable member turn that into a supplementary question. 

Mr Willie - She asked for the point of order before he sat down. 

The SPEAKER - No, he had already indicated that he was going off to his seat anyway, so ask a supplementary. 

Supplementary Question

Ms FINLAY - A supplementary question, minister, I'm on it. Who's in charge of your portfolio? You, the Premier, or the protest parties?

Members interjecting.

Mr PEARCE - Is that a valid question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - It's a supplementary question. It does relate to the point of order and it does relate to the original question, so I ask the minister to respond to the question.

Mr PEARCE - Alright, I am the responsible minister and, obviously, discussions happen within - we have a Cabinet process where we discuss things, we listen, we consult, we run, we think about things, we consider things, we formulate things, and we come up with a decision.

Members interjecting.


Salmon Industry - Marine Heatwave Plan

Mr GARLAND question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Mr PEARCE'

[10.58 a.m.]
Last month your department released its Marine Heatwave Plan in preparation for what is likely to be another summer of marine heatwaves. The plan was a recommendation from the reflections and learning process from the salmon mass-mortality event last summer. The plan stated that the aquaculture industry can improve its resilience to marine heatwaves by adjusting how it manages stock during an event. 

One of the tools it identified for you, minister, to prevent stress, illness and the spread of disease in farmed salmon is to reduce stocking densities in pens. We know we have all the preconditions for another mass mortality event this summer. Why is reducing stocking density off the table? 

The SPEAKER - With members asking the question, I ask you to speak a bit louder because if the ministers are behind you, it is very hard for them to hear the question.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the independent member for Braddon for his question. Stocking densities are important and you raised a very valid point. In fact, in the department we have a number of scientists and that's what their job is. That is, their scientific life is to determine the thresholds and the stocking densities within the salmonoid industry within Tasmania. 

It is different in various parts of the state. Obviously, environmental conditions dictate that we need to have the flexibility to put more fish in certain areas and less fish in others. That also has a seasonal layer upon that when it comes to considering the threshold limits. In certain times of the year, certain water temperatures and a number of environmental conditions will determine that threshold. This is not a hard and fast number that we just pluck. These are scientists that work hard every day. 

I asked the same question and I get where you're coming from. I asked the same question of my scientists when I took over this portfolio. They pointed me to a fish pen, told me the size of the fish pen, the dimensions and all the rest of it, and they said, 'Have a look, minister, where the fish are.' All these fish were congregated in one particular part of the fish pen. That's another consideration, and I know with your background - I'm not trying to teach you to suck eggs - but fish will congregate and school in certain concentrations within their pen. The point I'm making is that scientific rigour has been placed on the threshold limits within the salmon industry, as has the mortality threshold reportability numbers back to NRE and our chief government vets. It has been considered carefully and very scientifically.


Salmon Industry - Independent Review

Ms FINLAY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.04 a.m.]
Your sellout to the Greens and Mr George on salmon has undermined investment confidence and generated uncertainty on workers in regional communities across Tasmania. Your minister all but confirmed that you changed the terms of reference for this review to satisfy the Leader of the Greens. Did you direct a change to the terms of reference to the salmon review after talking to the Leader of the Greens?

The CEO of Salmon Tasmania, Dr Whittington, has said: 

This retrospective change to the terms of reference reinforces our deep concerns about its purposes and credibility.

How can anyone now believe this salmon review is anything but a cynical political stitch-up to risk the livelihoods of our salmon workers right across Tasmania?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for her question, but I reject the premise of the question. It's all about balance and listening to our community and understanding people's expectations. As the minister has said, we value our traditional industries - and I say traditional, albeit salmon was the 1980s. I could not think of an industry that has been more innovative than the salmon industry in a whole range of areas in terms of environment, sustainability and production. It's an industry that I believe the majority of Tasmanians are very proud of. Certainly, I am proud of the industry.

That doesn't mean that we shouldn't be encouraging the industry to continuously improve. Over the last decade, we have made continuous improvements to the regulatory environment, as you all know. We inherited a regulatory environment and greater community interest in the salmon industry and we needed to move with the times, work with the industry in terms of compliance and greater transparency, in terms of the industry itself and the practices, and work with the industry in terms -

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, honourable Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question specifically asks the Premier whether, after he received a call from the Leader of the Greens, he directed the changes to the terms of reference.

The SPEAKER - That does arise from the original question, Premier.

Ms Finlay - Yes or no?

Mr ROCKLIFF - What I am demonstrating -

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will come to the question in a moment, as if this is the biggest deal in the world - honestly.

We listen to people, gauge community feedback - wherever that comes from - in an attempt to ensure that the study we will do will be for the industry an opportunity to learn and continuously improve, notwithstanding the improvements that have been made and are continuously being made within the industry. What I was demonstrating then is the enormous amount of effort that the industry and regulators have made over the course of the last decade to support change in the industry, including transparency and independence in terms of the EPA. There were learnings from last summer, as the minister has spoken about today, and many times, and Mr George asked a question. There will be learnings from that.

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, honourable Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. Did the Premier direct the changes to the terms of reference, yes or no?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Ms Finlay, unlike you lot, we talk to each other and collaborate and we have collective decision-making. Thank you very much.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition has the call. She is asking a supplementary question.  I ask that she be allowed to be heard, please.

Supplementary Question

Ms FINLAY - Premier, what assurances can you give salmon workers across Tasmania that you haven't just started a witch-hunt to risk their livelihoods?

The SPEAKER - That's really a new question - you need to refer to your original question. 

Ms FINLAY - Premier, did you direct the changes to the terms of review in a witch hunt that risks the livelihoods of salmon workers right across Tasmania? 

Mr ROCKLIFF - The reason why, as Primary Industries minister for four years in government, I embarked on change and working with the industry, was to ensure the sustainability of the industry and that the industry meets community expectations. Anything that I do, anything that we decide as a government when it comes to the industry, is in the best interests of the long-term sustainability of the industry, because we want to ensure continuous improvement because we value the jobs in rural and regional Tasmania. 

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Honourable Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. On the supplementary question: yes or no, did he direct the changes and has he just started a witch-hunt to risk the livelihoods of salmon workers across Tasmania?

The SPEAKER - All right. Thank you.


Salmon Mass Mortality Event

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.09 a.m.]
Last summer's marine catastrophe saw diseased and decayed salmon and fat globules being washed up on southern beaches, animal cruelty and trucks and trucks of dead fish being dumped. It led to you rightly putting the industry on notice. The government's review yesterday of that mass salmon mortality shows that a lack of accurate and timely information from the industry 'delayed critical decision-making', but the report didn't even give the industry a slap on the wrist for the destruction they caused. It just asked salmon to consider writing their own code of practice for managing mortality events. There were no changes in stocking levels, biosecurity practices or anything else, just more self-regulation and a blank cheque to dump untested antibiotics in Tasmania's waterways. 

Do you accept the industry's self-regulation to date is the largest cause for the mass mortality event and will you compel the industry to change any practices to prevent another disaster before it's too late this summer?

The SPEAKER - The honourable member's time has expired.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. Given I'm copping it from both sides, we must be getting the balance right here. Clearly, that's what we're about. We're about listening to the community, responding to community concerns. There was a mass mortality event and we spoke about that in March this year, which seems a long time ago given what's happened since. I said quite openly that the industry is on notice, clearly, and I there are learnings from the review that was done and released a couple of days ago.

There are learnings from every major event. This was a mass mortality event. Every time we have a bushfire, floods, major events largely created through our environment, we investigate and review to ensure what the learnings are from that. There are always recommendations around major events, whether they be flood, fire, whatever the case may be, storm damage as well, and TasNetworks did a very good job in difficult circumstances last year or the year before. There are always learnings. This will be just the same as that, and I welcome a number of actions and of course we strongly support the advancement and implementation of those actions, but I've often mentioned continuous improvement in this place when it comes to the salmon industry, but not just the salmon industry, the forest industry, the mining industry, agriculture. 

All those industries are unrecognisable to where they were even 10 years ago, because people learn how to do things better, whether it's in terms of production, sustainability and caring for the environment, and the salmon industry is no different to that.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - The Premier said just then that these major events are largely created by the environment. True, but they can be mitigated by operational practices, and the learnings from that report do not contain any actions that require any changes to industry practices before this summer 

Will you look at that report's failure to provide actions if you're serious about putting the industry on notice, and consider the changes that have to be made to regulations for the salmon industry before this summer?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - In addition to the measures detailed in the report, industry has advised the government that it has been very proactively implementing measures to reduce the risk of another mortality event. Efforts include advancing selective breeding programs, refining feeding practices and pioneering risk-mitigation technologies. such as the innovative jellyfish bubble-curtain system.

Notably, the government has also been advised that every fish released into the waters of the state's south-east has been vaccinated with Tegovac Plus-EC. There are learnings from the department as well since the - don't look so pained, this is actually good.

Dr Woodruff - I was wondering about stocking levels - everything but stocking levels which will make a difference.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Other measures progressed by NRE include increasing veterinary and biosecurity compliance capability with three additional staff, I'm advised; implementation of the salmonid biosecurity quality certification program; planning and implementation of a 2025-26 biosecurity compliance audit program and marine aquaculture compliance strategy; increasing multi-regulated land- and water-based compliance assessment activities -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time has expired.


Greens Influence on the Government

Ms FINLAY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.14 a.m.]
It's clear the government is now being led by the Greens. What other industries should be concerned about their future under the Liberal-Greens government? What will you say when the Greens ring up demanding a review into the forestry industry, the mining industry, nature tourism in protected areas, renewables, agriculture? When you've sold out salmon workers again and again, how can any Tasmanians working in the regions and in these industries ever trust you?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for her question. This is a continuation of the constant Winter-Willie whinge fest which ignores the lessons of the last six months. If any member of the Chamber calls me or meets with me with concerns that they have, I will listen. I won't always agree, but I will listen.

You can call me if you like; I'll listen to you. I've had a good conversation with the federal member for Bass, Jess Teesdale, around securing the future of Bell Bay Aluminium and Liberty Bell Bay. I've had good conversations with Tim Ayres, the federal Minister for Industry and Innovation, sitting down, listening, putting our views forward, working on solutions -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. I've allowed a little bit of latitude with regard to interjections, but please allow the Premier over the next two minutes to finish his response.

Mr ROCKLIFF - sitting down, listening, being open to other points of view, ensuring that we can work collaboratively through some very challenging issues and get the balance right. We won't always agree. I've said many times, not one person in this Chamber can have 100 per cent of what they want 100 per cent of the time. If you're suggesting that I should stop listening to the community, then you haven't learnt your lesson that you should have learnt on 19 July this year.

We will continually engage with the community, but we will also ensure the future sustainability of rural and regional communities by backing the industries that employ many, many thousands of people across this state. That doesn't give those industries a blank cheque because it's not in their interest to have that blank cheque. It's in their interests of their workers to continuously improve sustainability, the environment and, of course, their production.

Supplementary Question

Ms FINLAY - A supplementary question, Speaker.

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms FINLAY - Is the Premier telling Tasmanians that off the back of a phone call, hours later, you can put mining, forestry, agriculture, and renewables at risk because what you've done with salmon is a good example of what needs to happen in other industries? Are all our other industries at risk from your response to calls from the Greens and other people on the crossbench?

Dr Woodruff - All we called for was public consultation and recommendations. It's not the end of the world. Is it that scary to Labor?

The SPEAKER - Order. Honourable Leader of the Greens, the member's time for the question has expired, honourable - 

Members interjecting

The SPEAKER - Order. I ask that the Premier be allowed to answer in silence, please.

Mr Mitchell - Rosalie has your back.

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=17.4_D=15.8_C=0.57] What's that, Brian?

Mr Mitchell - Rosalie has your back.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Oh, okay. 

Dr Woodruff - Labor afraid of public consultation and recommendations, says everybody.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition, this is your second warning.

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=35.6_D=23.8_C=0.76] We never stop listening to points of view. We won't always agree all of the time. In my view, the terms of reference were sensible changes that guaranteed and highlighted the consultation that was already in the terms of reference. Look, I'm not sure what you're trying to get at. We're trying to [Bookmark: Phr4_O=60.2_D=2.7_C=0.94]  work through and support our communities [Bookmark: Phr5_O=64.3_D=16.8_C=0.66]  sensibly, listening, making balanced decisions, and you can clearly see that balanced decisions are working. I'm proud of Tasmanians, we have the lowest unemployment in the country.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time has expired.


TasTAFE - Firearm Safety Course

Mr Di FALCO question to MINISTER for SKILLS and JOBS, Mr ELLIS

[11.19 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=95.8_D=24.0_C=0.83] We have heard over the past few weeks changes to courses offered by TasTAFE and cuts to subsidies. We accept that hard decisions need to be made in light of our current economic situation. The course in firearm safety is a crucial program I support, however there are drastic wait times of 6-12 months for people to undertake this. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=127.0_D=6.8_C=0.84]  Isn't this a great opportunity for revenue that TAFE should be benefiting from?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=135.1_D=3.3_C=0.80] Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Lyons for his question and his considerable interest in this matter. It's really important that we give people the opportunity to take part in the sport of shooting, whether that's target shooting competitions or even hunting, and I note one of the Greens member's interests in that particular matter as well.

I had the pleasure of doing the TasTAFE firearms course in the last 12 months an [Bookmark: Phr11_O=169.3_D=1.3_C=0.26] d I have to say, I enjoyed it. It was [Bookmark: Phr12_O=171.4_D=25.9_C=0.83]  a high-quality offering close to my place out the back of Sheffield in the beautiful electorate of Lyons. I commend the TAFE team for the work that they do.

We think that there are some opportunities to continue to improve the offering. One of the things that we committed to at the last election is to provide more choice for learners and more competition in the firearm safety market. It's important we get the balance right. We need to make sure that [Bookmark: Phr13_O=198.2_D=3.8_C=0.89]  we are looking after community safety as well as supporting responsible firear [Bookmark: Phr14_O=202.4_D=24.6_C=0.84] ms or future responsible firearms owners. We will be undertaking a process to see if there are providers who might be able to provide a second option for learners as well. We know that TAFE has good coverage right around the state - doing courses in Smithton, Launceston, Hobart, Sheffield - but we think that there are benefits that could come from competition in that market [Bookmark: Phr15_O=227.7_D=4.7_C=0.83] , but also managed in a safe and strong way.

In particular [Bookmark: Phr16_O=233.8_D=29.0_C=0.82] , there are a range of firearms training organisations that operate around the country, do so safely, provide safe, good-quality training and make sure that they meet all those thresholds. We will be working with potential providers about the opportunities to be a part of Tasmania's firearm safety course offering and, therefore, our licencing system. 

I will update the House, as well as you specifically, Mr Di Falco, on those opportunities, but yes, we do think there are opportunities to [Bookmark: Phr17_O=263.0_D=23.8_C=0.81]  open up firearms training to more people while still delivering a high-quality and safe option that will help more Tasmanians to enjoy the sport of shooting or hunting - the Tasmanian way of life. Those opportunities are ahead of us.

Time expired.


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Chigwell Community Garden

Ms BURNET question to MINISTER for COMMUNITY and MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS, Ms OGILVIE
 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=288.0_D=5.3_C=0.77] 
[11.20 a.m.]
My question is from members of the Chigwell Community Garden and playgroup [Bookmark: Phr19_O=293.9_D=11.0_C=0.78]  in our electorate of Clark. Last Friday, these members of the community attended the garden's last day of operation of the Chigwell Community Garden. Our community garden and playgroup deliver untold benefits and avoid longer term budget costs. It improves health, education, learning opportunities, inclusion and so much more.

The garden and outdoor playgroup is set to close because of a lack of funding for two part-time positions needed to keep these grassroots services going. The Chigwell community is devastated. Minister, will you fund the positions needed to keep this critical community service open?


Smart Metres Opt-Out Option

Ms DOW question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

My question is from my constituent Russell who lives in Braddon. Russell asks if the government's accelerated roll out of smart metres, removing the opt-out option, is legally valid given AEMCs ruling allowing insulations into year 2030.


People Living With Significant and Profound Disability 

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for DISABILITY SERVICES

Recently, in a meeting with Aurora Disability Services, you acknowledged a gap in educational funding for people living with significant and profound disabilities. Why is this cohort of people being discriminated against and what reforms are being considered to support them?


Hydro System - Impact of Dry Conditions

Mr VERMEY question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

It has been really dry in Tasmania over the last few years, with rainfall well below average. Considering we rely so much on Hydro power, is there any concern that we may run out of water and the energy could be in trouble in the state? 


Access to Tasmania's Natural Assets

Mr JAENSCH question to MINISTER for PARKS, Mr DUIGAN

People in my electorate Braddon, are pleased that upgrade works have recently been completed for Tasmania's great short walks in different parts of the state and iconic destinations like the Nut at Stanley.  Specifically, they would like to know what else is being done to improve access to our natural assets for people living with disability around the state.


Bass Highway - Heavy Vehicle Rest Area Near Westbury

Mr Di FALCO question to MINISTER for INRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPOT, Mr VINCENT

With the construction of the new heavy vehicle rest area on Bass Highway near Westbury now underway, local residents who live closest to the site are very concerned about the ongoing impact once it becomes a 24/7 facility, particularly from truck noise, engine braking and bright lighting through the night. These families have lived there for many years and are worried about losing their peace and quiet. 

Can you please advise what measures the government will put in place to reduce the effects of noise and light on these nearby homes and whether any further consultation or mitigation such as sound barriers, vegetation buffers or lighting controls will be considered.


Tomahawk Protection Society - ACEN Wind Project

Ms ROSOL question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

My question is on behalf of the Tomahawk Protection Society. The Tomahawk community has been excluded from the opportunity to participate in the processes outlined for major projects under the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993, due largely, but not exclusively, to ACEN's failure to follow best practice community engagement guidelines being advocated by the Tasmanian government and the Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner for wind farm developments. The Tomahawk Protection Society have sent you documents providing details of this. Will you and the government stand up for the Tomahawk community and make representations to ACEN to reconsider the Waterhouse component of North East Wind?


Housing Tasmania - Condition of Properties

Ms BROWN question to MINISTER for HOUSING and PLANNING, Mr VINCENT

Many constituents in my electorate who live in Housing Tasmania properties have contacted me with serious concerns about their homes being riddled with mould, largely due to the age and condition of these homes. One resident has been forced to seek alternative accommodation due to mould making the home uninhabitable. What action are you taking to ensure essential maintenance is taking place and carried out with this serious health issue?

[11.47 a.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, we will support the motion. We look forward very much, to the Estimates process taking its course and holding the government to account for the Budget as we will see it on Thursday. 

I note that the Treasurer has referred to it as an interim budget. It will be interesting to see whether that means any changes to the conduct of Estimates. I've never been involved with interim Estimates before, but rest assured, we will be holding the government to account during that Estimates process. 

I want to note that there was good-faith negotiation on the time allocations, and the opposition is satisfied with some of the changes that were made at our request. I note that there are some very long sitting days, particularly for the Chairs who will be responsible for the first time for chairing Estimates Committee this year. I wish them all the best in that very important task, and I look forward to taking part myself, as do all my colleagues.

[11.48 a.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I will be quick, we will obviously support this motion and acknowledge the work that's been put in by the government with all members in terms of accommodating this schedule, and acknowledge the work of Ms Giblin in our office and Mr Street in the government's office. 

We look forward to this process as well. I acknowledge the mountain of annual reports that are on our desk, on the table here today, and the short amount of time we and our staff have to get through them. That's just a figment of the tabling timelines and the budget timelines. It's not a criticism; it's just an observation. Best wishes to staff and everyone who is wading through those annual reports in the lead up to Estimates. 

I make the point as well, given there will be a subsequent motion around Government Business Enterprises, and we literally have the budget Estimates process and then GBE estimates back-to-back. I want to acknowledge the work and the pressures that we will place on staff across the House, whether it be departmental and ministerial staff, whether it be our staff as members. I also particularly acknowledge the parliamentary staff. I know that turning around those committee rooms really quickly is a big task for a whole range of people in this building. I acknowledge their work upfront and acknowledge that our agreeing and wanting business scrutiny to come straight after budgets will put additional stress on the systems in this place.

[11.50 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - If I may briefly sum up, Speaker. I thank all the parties and the Independents for their collaboration in ensuring that we could get an agreed position to put before the House in relation to these motions.

Can I respectfully correct, or slightly advise, the member for Clark, Mr Bayley, that all these annual reports - sure, they're physically tabled today - but they have been available publicly for some considerable period of time in most cases, if not all of them. Hopefully staff have had the opportunity to avail themselves of the detail and think up trick questions for Estimates. 

Motion agreed to.


MOTION

Government Businesses Scrutiny Committees - Attendance of Legislative Council Ministers

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) (by leave) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House of Assembly requests that the Legislative Council give leave to the honourable the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and the honourable Minister for Energy and Renewables to appear before and give evidence to the House of Assembly Government Businesses Scrutiny Committees.

[11.52 a.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I will speak very briefly and again indicate that we will support this motion and look forward to scrutinising the GBE committees. 

I note that the government was accommodating of the request for all GBEs to appear in the lower House, and that our colleagues in the upper House didn't take that path. So, as the member for Clark, my colleague, Mr Bayley said, it does make for a long few weeks, particularly for parliamentary staff. 

I want to, in particular, give my foreshadowed thoughts to the Hansard staff because I know originally that week was planned for Hansard staff to be able to catch up between Estimates and the Estimates report back week. So, it will be a heavy workload to finish off the year for Hansard, as well as all the parliamentary staff and attendants and everyone in this Chamber as well. I also look forward to GBE hearings. 

Motion agreed to.

[11.53 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, I finally move -

The motion to establish the government businesses scrutiny committee as circulated.

In moving that, I echo the sentiments of the Leader of Opposition Business and the Deputy Leader of the Greens in thanking all those involved who will allow this process to proceed and have our democracy work at its very best.

Motion agreed to.


MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Government Decision-Making and Leadership

[11.54 a.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House take note of the following matter: government decision making and leadership. 

Off the back of Question Time this morning and public presentation of this government over recent weeks and months, the lack of leadership and the crazy way that decisions are being made by this government is a real concern, not only for people on this side of the House, but for Tasmanians, particularly those living in regional Tasmania. During Question Time, ministers did not appear to be in control of their portfolios and that is a real concern for the people that they represent. The Minister for Primary Industries and Water this morning was not able to clarify that he is making critical decisions in his portfolio area.

When the Premier speaks of consultation and working with others, it all sounds very warm and friendly. However, when a government - and governments are meant to govern - goes into consultation, make a decision and publicly releases the terms of reference for a review, then that government is making a decision based on consultation. If all it takes is for the Leader of the Greens to pick up the phone and call the Premier and say, 'You know what, I don't like it,' and that he jumps immediately and critically change the terms of review, then that is not okay. What it signals to the balance of Tasmanians is: no one is here safe.

Yes, consultation is important, but if off the whim of someone who doesn't like something, they pick up the phone and the Premier jumps immediately, overstepping his ministers - then Tasmanians have a right to be concerned. Tasmanians, whether they be in the greyhound industry - the amazing families who for generations have lived and breathed that industry - they are at risk here by this Premier. The people and the workers of the salmon industry are at risk by this Premier. 

I know that there are other ministers who are being leapfrogged in their responsibility, where the Minister for Energy and Renewables can't stand up for energy users in his own electorate, the Minister for Primary Industries and Water is so childish in the way he plays games with the livelihoods of families at Liberty Bell Bay and Bell Bay Aluminium, it is no wonder that the Premier feels like he has to stand up, but if this government doesn't have ministers with the capability to deliver in their portfolio areas, then Tasmanians are concerned and at risk.

Governments are meant to govern. We know that the protest parties will just protest and that they don't actually want to work for positive outcomes for Tasmanians. We know that when they come to this place and say they want to work cooperatively, that is not their reason for being. This government needs to stand up and be strong, but when it's a Liberal-Greens government, we know that it's actually the tail wagging the dog here and they're not able to be strong and stand up.

On this side of the House, we want to work hard for Tasmanians. We are going to outwork this government, out-think this government and we are going to out-connect with Tasmanians as opposed to this government. We are out each and every day in our community, talking to the Tasmanians who are being undermined by the lack of leadership and the lack of quality decisions by this government.

Recently on a trip to Canberra, I had the absolute delight to speak to a visiting school group who were visiting Canberra. They were young people from the Strahan Primary School, collectively they were four, five and sixes up in Canberra learning about good leadership and good decision-making. They were led by parent help, including Salty, a salmon worker from the west coast of Tasmania. We know that the undermining of the salmon industry, greyhounds, forestry, mining, renewables, and agriculture in Tasmania is next on the list for this government who can't stand up and be strong. What that means for people like Salty, his family, his co-workers and the young kids at the Strahan Primary School, is that if regional communities are at risk, if our traditional industries, if our productive industries are at risk, those primary schools won't have a future. Those families in those communities won't have a future.

It will impact health services, will impact the delivery of basic services like the supermarkets, the takeaways, the pubs. Real communities, real families across regional Tasmania are on notice and at risk from this government.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=15.5_D=30.0_C=0.86] There is not quality decision-making, there is not strong leadership. We know that minister on minister on minister on minister are having their responsibilities taken away from them and decisions are being made by the Premier off the back of a phone call. 'How high do you want me to jump? I'm just going to do it.' In response to the Leader of the Greens, Peter George, and other members from the protest parties on this crossbench. 

Tasmanian Labor stands with the community, with families and with workers across Tasmania. Whether it be the workers at  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=45.7_D=20.3_C=0.82] Liberty Bell Bay or Bell Bay Aluminium who need ministers to be strong and to stand up, not just to their own Premier, but to stand up to the government business enterprises of Tasmania. Someone needs to take control here. Someone needs to be a leader. Someone needs to stand strong and make sure that they're backing people in regional Tasmania.

Time expired.

[11.59 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=66.8_D=14.0_C=0.83] Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Attorney-General) - Honourable Speaker, I'm pleased to stand today on this matter of public importance about leadership and decision-making because that's exactly what the Rockliff Liberal government is  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=80.8_D=14.3_C=0.84] about. The Premier indicated earlier today our priorities are getting the balance right, listening, and growing our economy. He made mention that we have the lowest unemployment rate in history [Bookmark: Phr6_O=95.4_D=18.3_C=0.82]  and at record lows of some 4 per cent. We are focused on that as a government, working together with our productive industries, the business sector, and the community to build Tasmania's future. That is what we are on about as a government [Bookmark: Phr7_O=115.4_D=10.0_C=0.71]  and we are acting decisively.

I want to pay a tribute right up front to Jo Palmer, Minister for Education and Minister for Children and Youth, who is doing a fantastic job. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=125.7_D=21.4_C=0.87]  She indicated today on the public record, her passion, care, and interest. Every week she is in and out of our schools, listening to the teachers, talking to new teachers, talking to principals, listening to them and our children, seeking the best for them and the best education possible.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=148.2_D=7.6_C=0.84] That was made very clear in terms of Gavin Pearce as the Minister for Primary Industries and Water [Bookmark: Phr10_O=156.5_D=29.6_C=0.85] , a responsibility that I held previously, and I know others in this Chamber have as well. He is totally across the brief to support a sustainable, productive industry and get the balance right. It has been made clear again.

What we are not on about is what Labor is on about and that is the scare campaigns and the relentless negativity that goes on and on and on. We are sick - and I think Tasmanians are [Bookmark: Phr11_O=186.5_D=29.7_C=0.83]  - sick of the Winter-Willie whinge fest. It continued through the election campaign that was forced upon the Tasmanian people. Here they are banging on about budget matters. The Labor-Greens team blocked the budget, then we went into a winter election that was forced on the Tasmanian people. They didn't want it, but they sent a message.

The message was loud and clear, particularly for Labor [Bookmark: Phr12_O=217.4_D=28.9_C=0.81]  - and the poll out today, I will not reflect directly on it, but there is a message there for the Labor leader and the Labor opposition. Are you listening to the people?

We are trying to get the balance right and deliver a strong economy. The Treasurer has made it clear today that we are investing in infrastructure. We are investing in a game-changing stadium that will deliver a [Bookmark: Phr13_O=246.5_D=17.0_C=0.81]  team for Tasmania. As a result of that investment, we can reinvest in the essential services of health, housing and education. As a government that is what we are pleased and proud to be doing [Bookmark: Phr14_O=264.1_D=24.6_C=0.85] . We back our business investment and exports, in particular as the minister for Trade. 

I want to pick up on the Deputy Leader for the Opposition's comments about her visits to Canberra last week. We have not heard much about her visit to Canberra. We have not heard much about her advocacy for Tasmania in Canberra. We haven't heard much about that because we, as a government, have been [Bookmark: Phr15_O=289.4_D=5.7_C=0.79]  advocating to the federal Labor government to support our major industrials [Bookmark: Phr16_O=295.6_D=9.4_C=0.81] , as we have in Tasmania. The Premier has met with the minister Mr Ayers just last week. We have heard about Felix Ellis, minister Jane Howlett has been up there supporting industry and Tasmanians non-stop.

Let's make it very clear: there is a green aluminium fund that is available for green aluminium, and we need to work that through with the federal government. It is acknowledged it is a federal-state government responsibility.

What has the Labor Deputy Opposition Leader said about that? What has she said? She said nothing. She's just said crickets about it. She's made mention of meeting her school children in Canberra. That's excellent. I'm very pleased to hear about that. But what about your meetings with your federal Labor colleagues? Please tell us about that. Did you advocate at all for Tasmania?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr BARNETT - Now this is the question. Why don't they come up? You have spent multiple days in Canberra and have said nothing about it, so time will tell. The question is now for you to step up.

Time expired.
[12.04 p.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, the question the MPI today is about leadership and decision making. It is really an open question: who is really leading Tasmania? What we have seen just in Question Time today and indeed before Question Time, is the Greens' tail wagging the Liberal dog. How do you actually describe this government? The way that we can think about it now, it is becoming pretty clear after Question Time, that it is not just the Greens tail wagging the Liberal dog, it's more likely the protester wagging the Liberal dog. So, what we have now is a Liberal-protester coalition, because it seems like the protester politicians that have been elected in this place are now the ones who are directing the Liberal government.

What we have seen just in Question Time today: who is actually leading this government? We saw that the Premier receives phone calls from the Leader of the Greens and then changes his mind and then directs the minister. What we see from Question Time today, and we've seen in the past, too, is that the minister is not running his portfolio because, just like after the election, we have the minister, Gavin Pearce, saying one thing and the Premier undermining him and saying another.

The classic example of that is the Premier rings up the independent member for Franklin, Mr George, and says there is a disease outbreak in the Huon, in the D'Entrecasteaux Channel, down in the Huon. Then we have the minister saying exactly the opposite thing: 'No, actually' - dumbfounded - 'Well, no, there actually isn't a disease outbreak.' Then, subsequently to that, we have a Premier who sold out the salmon industry.

We have seen that the Premier's form has basically been, over the time, is to sell out and then to do over. So he sells something out, like he sold out the previous independents, Mr Tucker and Ms Alexander, get them on side and then sell them out. We saw the Premier sell out the salmon industry and then try to do over the Independents and the Greens who put him in the Premier seat. Obviously that attempt this time failed because the Greens saw the terms of reference to this so-called salmon review, which is more like a witch hunt, and saw the terms of reference, got on the phone and then said, 'You've got to change it.' Then, what does the Premier do? He changes it. It's the Greens, in effect, driving the bus on this salmon inquiry. Likewise, we've seen the Premier sell out other industries. We've seen him absolutely sell out the greyhound industry and we've seen him backflip on forestry.

Who is running the show? Well, it doesn't seem like it's the Premier. It seems like whoever can get on the phone and call the Premier and use their leverage can get the Premier to change his mind. Then the Premier directs the minister, and the minister has to cop it. That seems like the way that this is actually operating. It is not actually the Premier who is running the show. It is definitely not the minister who's running the show. It is the protesters who are running the show.

I think we have to look further than that, too, because what we have seen over the last, well at least the last five years is we had GBEs operating, government business enterprise operating largely without the oversight of government. That's costing us hundreds of millions of dollars.

We have an Education minister in today's Question Time, and it is pretty obvious she is very passionate about going to schools and getting photos, but clearly is not in charge. 

We have the Premier who's not in charge, the minister is not in charge, the government is not in charge of the GBEs - they're largely doing what they want. If we wind the clock forward, we're going to see an even more catastrophic situation after Thursday. It might actually be the bankers, the bond market, and the rating agencies running the state. We've seen this government rack up huge debts, and it won't be long before the ratings agencies are saying 'This is what you're going to have to do to get your credit rating back up,' and indeed the government will have to follow. 

There is a couple of billion dollars of debt that is going to have to be refinanced pretty soon. If the ratings agencies have significant problems with the Budget, they will literally be directing the government to change their pathways. We've even got serious economics correspondents like Shane Wright in the Sydney Morning Herald talking about a federal bailout of Tasmania. That is the situation we have. The bankers are going to be in charge, the protesters, but it is definitely not the Liberals in charge.

[12.09 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, it is a very fitting day today to talk about decision making and leadership, and as we approach the Budget with the stadium coming to parliament, it's a theme in the front of mind of most Tasmanians and certainly everyone sitting in this chamber. Across the state, people are struggling to meet their basic needs. They can't find a home and they can't access healthcare when they need it.

It is a struggle for many people to pay for school and the education outcomes in Tasmania continue to lag behind the country. Communities are seeing deeply concerning changes to their natural environment. We're seeing the impacts of climate change, damaging industries, pollution and inappropriate development. They are all obvious to many. It is a sad reality that when I go to Franklin and across Tasmania, optimism for the future is harder to find than ever before. 

People obviously love our home island, Lutruwita. It is beautiful. They see the news from around the world and they know how lucky we are to live here, while at the same time they feel like this state is on an inexorable trajectory to be in a much worse situation tomorrow than it is today, and next year getting worse and worse. 

The state of the Budget is causing a lot of concern for many. When you look at what's happening here, the decisions that are being made by Liberal and Labor politicians, it is easy to see why many in the community are despairing of what's happening with politics in Tasmania. 

There are so many major problems in health and housing, essential services, public sector unions are on strike, trying to get a fair deal for wages and conditions, a terrible debt confronting us, the climate crisis taking hold. What the government is doing is to focus all the energy, all the resources of government, to build a stadium that we don't need that will ultimately cost taxpayers $2 billion that we should be spending on other things that we desperately need. 

It will mean more cuts to services. When politicians are so out of touch, they make decisions like this. It is no wonder that people across Tasmania feel let down. It is the ultimate warped priority. Let us be clear, all of us know what the Liberal and Labor politicians in here are going to do when the stadium vote comes, and that is deeply saddening for many Tasmanians and very outraging for many more. 

The majority of Tasmanians do not want this stadium to be built. Under Jeremy Rockliff as Premier, the Liberals have used every dirty dishonest and heartless trick to pursue the project, heedless of the cost. Meanwhile, Labor have had about a dozen different positions on the stadium. There is no leadership. There is no certainty from Labor except when it comes to parliament, they have finally made it clear that they will unconditionally provide their support for the stadium and provide a blank cheque to the government to boot to pay for whatever they want, whatever it will cost.

That's not leadership. It is not the way the community expects their elected representatives to act. No matter what the leadership of the Liberals and Labor, the Greens won't stop fighting to make sure that this stadium is not built. We know it is not a done deal. The other place will have a final say. 

In Tasmania, I feel the sense deeply at the moment that we're at a crossroads with the extraordinary debt we're looking at coming online, and the idea that Liberal and Labor politicians would vote to bring in another $2 billion-plus to the burden of debt for future generations, which we know will cost community services, is deeply, deeply disgraceful. The Greens will be voting against the stadium because we know there are so many other priorities. 

Labor might go outside and talk to the public sector and unions about their conditions and wages at lunchtime and many other days in the months to come, and they should really understand what will be at cost if they support the stadium. What it will mean is $2 billion less over the next decade to be putting into public sector jobs and conditions, putting into community services, the neighbourhood centres and the family violence support services. The economists have told us we are not locked in and we hope the major parties aren't locked in to supporting that stadium. 

Time expired.

[12.14 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Treasurer) - Deputy Speaker, it's refreshing to see that the Labor Party understands there is a need for decision-making and leadership. I hope they learn, as they look across the table and see how the Liberal government, led by Jeremy Rockliff, makes decisions and shows leadership, because as my friend, the Attorney-General, just said, the people of Tasmania have had enough of the Winter-Willie whingefest. There is this relentless negativity, there is no alternative budget. They sent us to an early election over budget repair.

Mr Winter - You tried to stop it, didn't you?

Mr ABETZ - Do they sit on the budget panel like the Greens and everybody else in this Chamber does? No, because they have no policy offerings to make, no suggestions. They don't want to learn. Therefore, they have absented themselves over the issue that they said they were sending the Tasmanian people to an election about. 

Indeed, after the election they came in here with another no-confidence motion claiming the same things. You would have thought that in their heart and soul, buried deep somewhere in there, there might have been a genuine concern for budget repair, but when given the opportunity to be part of the panel, they squibbed it. They're not up to it. They're not willing to do it. 

I can understand why, because when they were in the throes of the no-confidence motion, they looked around themselves and found that there was nobody of sufficient quality to be their treasurer, and as a result they had to go to the upper House and try and find somebody up there. 

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Members to my left.

Mr ABETZ - They complain and complain and complain, but they are unable to provide any solutions. 

The member for Braddon, Dr Broad, asked the question, who is leading Tasmania? I can answer that. They are Tasmanians, by Tasmanians for Tasmanians, unlike the Labor Party, which is still under federal administration, and that is why those opposite, because they are beholden to Canberra, are unable to criticise Canberra for its lack of funding for health, for its lack of funding for Bell Bay. So they wheel out rookie senators like Senator Dowling to be the apologist for Canberra. Senator Dowling and Labor senators were actually elected to be the advocates for Tasmania in Canberra, not to be the apologist for Canberra in Hobart. 

Then the Labor Party wonders why they wander in the wilderness. The reason simply is that they're not up to it. Even your own federal body doesn't trust you to run yourselves, and yet you have the audacity to come in here and talk about leadership, as though you have some offering to provide. Might I suggest, with deep respect, get your own house in order before you seek to say to others that somehow you have the capacity for leadership. 

I was listening to Dr Woodruff's contribution [Bookmark: Phr2_O=15.2_D=15.0_C=0.80]  and could not help but note that the Labor Party were complaining that the Greens were voting with us. Then I heard from the Greens that the Labor Party were voting with us. That is what happened on the stadium [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.2_D=30.0_C=0.80] , Dr Broad. I think the Premier got it absolutely right this morning during Question Time. He is the Premier and this is a government that listens and is willing to take into account the varying differing views that are represented in this Chamber. 

If I had my wish, of course it would be a majority Liberal government. I am sure if Dr Woodruff had her wish it would be a majority Greens government and [Bookmark: Phr4_O=60.8_D=19.3_C=0.80]  if Dean Winter, the member for Franklin, had his opportunity, it would have been a majority Labor government, but it is not so. It is a minority government that requires collaboration and cooperation, and that is what leadership is. That is the sort of leadership that is required now and is being delivered.

[12.19 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon) -  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=81.2_D=22.3_C=0.68] Deputy Speaker, I can tell you what it is. It is a Liberal-Greens coalition.

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order, order. Before you continue, can we have order. Through the Chair, please.

Ms DOW - [Bookmark: Phr6_O=104.5_D=21.7_C=0.82]  I think if the previous speaker had his wish, honourable Deputy Speaker, he would be the leader of the Liberal Party and we wouldn't have gone to an early election, but he didn't get his wish because you can't get everything you want 100 per cent of the time. We learnt that this morning. 

Mr Abetz - Did you vote for Dean?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Treasurer, please.

Ms DOW -  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=128.3_D=6.9_C=0.53] You didn't have the numbers. 

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order.

Ms DOW - Deputy Speaker, if I get drawn into a debate [Bookmark: Phr8_O=135.6_D=2.8_C=0.73]  with Mr Abetz, I will do that outside the Chamber [Bookmark: Phr9_O=139.6_D=27.6_C=0.83] . 

When you talk about decision making and leadership in this place, there has been a complete absence of that for the last 11 years, and the dire situation that Tasmania finds itself in is a direct product of that. Tasmania is headed towards a Liberal-Greens disaster that will have worst outcomes for Tasmanians, particularly regional Tasmanians, than the what once was Liberal-Lambie coalition, which even the Premier at the time [Bookmark: Phr10_O=167.6_D=1.9_C=0.68]  warned of the economic disaster that would flow from that [Bookmark: Phr11_O=169.9_D=2.6_C=0.82]  and the dire effects that that would have on our health system.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=174.1_D=23.3_C=0.82] Our economy in Tasmania is crashing, and you will not hear those on the other side speak about the State of the State report that was released just last week by CommSec. What did that tell us? It told us that Jeremy Rockliff's first economic report card after his sellout to the Greens, Kristie Johnston and Peter George, paint a picture of economic devastation across Tasmania. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=198.5_D=6.0_C=0.87]  On eight annual indicators, Tasmania ranked last of all the states on each of those. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=205.3_D=29.6_C=0.79]  We were the only economy in Australia to forecast a shrink. The report highlighted shrinking household spending, equipment investment and construction work, and private sector demand was described as 'anaemic'. 

You don't see any cranes on the skyline across Hobart or any of our major centres anymore. The only place you will see them is at Devonport, at the port where this government forgot to build a berth. That is the only place you will see cranes at the moment across Tasmania, and as they say, when there are cranes on the skyline [Bookmark: Phr15_O=234.9_D=11.6_C=0.77]  the state's economy is doing well and small to medium enterprises across the state are thriving. That is not happening at the moment and it's only going to get worse under a Liberal-Greens minority government.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=248.0_D=23.4_C=0.75] Businesses say they can't trust Jeremy Rockliff. Communities can't trust Jeremy Rockliff. His own team can't trust him because he rolled them too around his decisions which he took to keep his own job as Premier of Tasmania. Every time he will put the Liberal Party and his own self-interest above the interests of his own team and the interests of Tasmanians.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=272.6_D=28.8_C=0.82] How could you invest in a state where the Premier signed a letter that meant nothing to the salmon industry, to the greyhound racing industry? He will continue to do deals behind doors with the Greens, and you can see that today. It is the acting premier, Dr Rosalie Woodruff, who is directing and leading the government at the moment in Tasmania. It is not the Premier, Jeremy Rockliff, and you can see that today from what has transpired here in this parliament, particularly around the changes to the terms of reference document for the salmon review, which he ruled out [Bookmark: Phr18_O=301.7_D=2.3_C=0.75]  prior to the election. It was only w [Bookmark: Phr19_O=304.7_D=0.3_C=0.84] hen the time cam to save his own skin, keep his own job, that he rolled over and he sold out on regional Tasmanians.

Tasmania is at a crossroads, Dr Woodruff, I'll agree with you on that one point. We are absolutely at a crossroads. We have the worst health outcomes in the country. We have over 60,000 Tasmanians waiting to see a specialist. We have the longest social housing wait list that we've ever had. We have potholes in our roads. We have our road services absolutely capitulating across the state and we have a Liberal government that doesn't have a plan to fix it. That's only going to get worse under a Liberal-Greens coalition in this state. It's going to be an absolute disaster. It's Tasmanians that will continue to suffer under this government's regime.

There is no greater example, in my mind, of the lack of leadership or poor decision making of this government than the Spirits. We have billion-dollar ships with nowhere to berth and no fenders. We have a critically important government business enterprise in TT-Line, that's critical to regional economies and jobs, that's struggling to stay afloat. That's as a side to the fact that we have the biggest infrastructure stuff up in history and all the billions of dollars of waste that have been associated with this project. When will it all end? You can't trust this government.

TAXATION AND RELATED LEGISLATION (FIRST HOME OWNER AND PAYROLL RELIEF) BILL 2025 (No. 43)

In Committee

Continued from 25 September 2025, page 102.

Clause 5 
Section 18 amended (Amount of grant)

[12.26 a.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON - Deputy Chair, I will try to be brief, because there has been some time since we got to this point in the clauses, to remind members of the amendment that I have proposed to the clause. It relates partly to an amendment that I will be proposing under Clause 6, in relation to putting a cap on the provision of the grant of $750,000, as the purchase amount. Therefore, this clause, the amendment that I'm proposing here is in two parts.

The first part would require that if someone exceeded the $750,000 amount that they would not receive the $30,000 amount, but they also wouldn't receive the default $10,000 amount.

The second part of this amendment to Clause 5 requires that the provisions would expire on 1 July 2026. To provide context for that: when we're in a very constrained budget environment, it's really important that this parliament has eyes across initiatives such as this. We have heard in briefing after briefing that there is absolutely no evidence that this particular initiative creates more available homes; there's no data around that. We also have the Productivity Commission recommendations, which talk specifically about the need to have targeted initiatives. This is not a target initiative as it stands. However, with these particular amendments, it would target it. It provides the opportunity for hopefully some data to be collected about the effectiveness of this particular initiative, to creating more housing opportunities for Tasmanians.

I commend the amendments to the House.

Mr BAYLEY - Thank you, Deputy Chair. It is some time since we've looked at this. I took some time to refresh my mind as to the debate before we adjourned on this particular bill. I will say up front that we Greens support this amendment. The notion of a $750,000 cap for eligibility for this scheme is a very fair one. You could make the point quite easily that someone who can afford to build or buy a $750,000 home in this day and age doesn't necessarily need government or taxpayer support to do that. This amendment is a way to ensure that the extent of this is limited.

The Treasurer in his contribution made the point that only 18 of the 391 properties were indeed over $750,000. That's 4.6 per cent. Therefore, I believe his argument in that context, therefore, is not costing the taxpayer a hell of a lot of money.

Mr Abetz - I will be correcting that figure - that is higher.

Mr BAYLEY - Okay, I look forward to your correction, Treasurer. Nonetheless, if that is the argument that there's only a small amount that this effects and therefore it has a small impact on the budget or on the overall cost of this scheme, then I believe the converse is very true as well, that if there's only a small percentage of people who would be affected by this amendment, then similarly it's not having a huge impact on Tasmanians. I make the point again that if it's a $750,000 home, there's a question as to whether they really need government support to buy that home.

I ask the Treasurer to not to use me, as he did in his last contribution, as a justification for rejecting this limit. I acknowledge that I was a beneficiary of a first homeowner grant many, many years ago - 20 years ago - but it certainly wasn't to buy a $750,000 house. I believe it was a $120,000 odd house at the time, and I believe it was a $7000 first home owner grant. The principle still stands irrespective of that, that a $750,000 build or purchase doesn't necessarily need to get government support.

With that, I will reiterate our support for this this clause. It doesn't change our support for the scheme and indeed the increase from $10,000 to $30,000, but it sets a cap to the eligibility and I believe that's entirely appropriate.

Mr ABETZ - Deputy Chair, the government opposes the amendments but nevertheless thanks the member for Clark, Ms Johnston, for bringing these matters to the Chamber. They are worthy of debate. They are worthy of consideration, but we respectfully will be seeking the House's concurrence to have the bill passed as it is.

In fairness, a recipient of the current $10,000 First Home Owner Grant who's eligible transaction date fell within 2025-26, and who has exceeded the newly-specified $750,000 cap will not get the extra $20,000 and rather, they will no longer be eligible for the First Home Owner Grant, and if the grant has been paid, they would be required to repay the $10,000 grant. That is one of the consequences of this proposal. I understand the motivation of it, but there are unforeseen consequences, I suspect, which I would not expect the member for Clark, Ms Johnston, to be wishing or hoping for people having to repay the $10,000 grant when they were anticipating $30,000.

I'm also advised that the proposed change removes the ability to pay the $10,000 grant where an application is made after 1 July 2025, but applies to the period from applications received from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 25. Therefore, the removal of section 18(2)(b) has much broader implications than intended in the proposed amendment.

Turning to the matter where, I trust, I politely interjected on the member for Clark, Mr Bayley, yes, when we debated this matter last time, I indicated that on my advice, there was a 4.6 per cent of applicants who would be above the $750,000 threshold. In fact, the figure is 21 per cent, to be more accurate. They are updated Treasury figures I was made aware of this morning, so, I correct the record, if I may, relatively as soon as possible after that was drawn to my attention.

Whilst we can talk about these percentages, what we are talking about is 81 applicants. It is a relatively small amount of people in any event, and you then have to have the administration of the means testing and how do you value the $750,000? That is where it becomes exceptionally difficult with a home grant because if you are a home builder contracting a builder, you would potentially fall into the $750,000, so, in the quote to build don't put the concrete paths around the house, don't concrete the driveway, don't put in the carpets and just do one undercoat of paint on the walls rather than fully paint them. You can see how it could be scanned to a certain extent to fit the threshold with imaginative minds. And yes, they are out there to make sure that they fit in with the schemes.

This was an election policy that we took to the people. We are anxious to have this carried by the parliament, if it deems appropriate, by the end of the year because this is the extension of the scheme we had set up for a 12 month period from 1 July 2025 to 30 June 2026. Unless this is passed this calendar year, we will have progressed more than halfway through that 12 month period without this matter being resolved.

Therefore, I commend to the House the bill as it stands and would urge the House to vote against the amendments.

Mr WINTER (Franklin) - Deputy Chair, we won't be supporting the amendment either, as well-intentioned as it is. I echo the sentiments and I appreciate the member for Clark bringing this amendment and the attempt to put some guardrails around the amendment.

In the break I was able to seek advice, be briefed by Treasury, and I appreciate the opportunity to do that, particularly about the unintended consequences. The one that really concerned me was that someone who had applied for the first homeowner grant and potentially received it this this financial year, even for the $10,000, might actually need to pay it back and, from a certainty point of view and for the intended consequence of this policy, there are some serious concerns with that.
We are aware - and everyone's aware - there is a housing crisis. The intention of this policy, as it has been the intention of governments in Tasmania for the last 20 years has been that this policy would drive demand, which has been somewhat subdued over the last few years. We already have the problem that we are here on the first Tuesday in November, 5 months into the financial year, debating a policy designed to increase demand in the property markets. The policy intention is difficult to achieve if there is some uncertainty, there's people paying it back and also the timeline as outlined by the Treasurer in this case.

I appreciate the attempt here to put guardrails, but I am concerned about the unintended consequences in the drafting of the amendment, which is why we're not supporting it today.

Amendment negatived.

Clause 5 agreed to.

Clause 6 -
Section 18L inserted. - 18L. Conditions on increase in grant

Ms JOHNSTON - Deputy Chair, I thank members for their contribution on the previous clause. Hopefully, this particular clause might answer some of those questions, particularly, the concerns from the Treasurer about the calculations in relation to that. I also acknowledge the contribution by the shadow treasurer in relation to the intent. It's quite clear from the Productivity Commission's evidence that there is a need to be targeted in any kind of assistance and, in the absence of data showing that this is an effective measure or initiative to increase housing affordability, it's incredibly important that this House provides some scrutiny of that.

Added to that, the impact on a budget when we are in a very constrained budget position, if I can understand correctly from the Treasurer, 81 applicants at $30,000 would be approximately $2.4 million. That is a lot of money, when we're talking about the impact, for instance, on the Bucaan Community House seeking $150,000. It's a lot of money to be given away on an initiative that has no evidence base to it. In fact, we have a lot of evidence that it drives prices up when it comes to construction. This goes to the heart of my amendments for clause 6. I will read them in because they're quite lengthy. I move - 

First amendment

Page 5, proposed new section 18L, subsection (1), after paragraph (a).

Insert the following paragraph.

(X)	as calculated on the commencement date for the eligible transaction, the value of the eligible transaction does not exceed $750 000; and

Second amendment

Same page, same proposed new section, after subsection (1).

Insert the following subsections.

(A)	For the purposes of subsection (1)(X), the value of an eligible transaction is –

(a)	if the eligible transaction is a contract for the purchase of a new home, the total consideration payable under the contract; and

(b)	if the eligible transaction is a comprehensive home building contract, the sum of the following:

(i)	the total consideration payable under each contract that forms part of the comprehensive home building contract;

(ii)	the total cost of materials used in work performed under the comprehensive home building contract, if consideration payable under the contract does not include the cost of those materials;

(iii)	if the purchase of land, to which the comprehensive home building contract relates, does not form part of the contract, the market value for the land on the commencement date for the eligible transaction; and

(c)	if the eligible transaction is the building of a home by an owner builder, the sum of the following:

(i)	the total cost of materials used in building the home, if consideration payable under a contract under subparagraph (ii) does not include the cost of those materials;

(ii)	the total consideration payable under each contract that the owner builder enters into in respect of work to be performed on the home being built;

(iii)	the market value for the land, on which the home is to be built, on the commencement date for the eligible transaction.

(B)	For the purposes of subsection (A), the Commissioner may take into account one or more of the following when determining the market value of land for the purposes of that subsection:

(a)	an independent valuation of the land;

(b)	a valuation of the land under the Valuation of Land Act 2001;

(c)	the last sale price for the land, include the last price at which a contract for sale was entered into for the land;

(d)	any other matter the Commissioner considers relevant.

The first part of this amendment introduces a cap of $750,000 on the value of an eligible transaction. This is consistent with most other states and territories, and caps are frequently used in Tasmania and elsewhere in different kinds of other assistance schemes. This proposal should not be considered a new idea or controversial. Under the First Home Owner Grant Act, eligible transactions are, as I said, a contract to purchase a new home, a comprehensive home building contract or a construction of a home by an owner-builder, and the amendment clarifies that the calculation of the value of the eligible transaction is the commencement date, which is already defined in section 13(4) of the act.

In the case of a contract for sale or building, it is the date when the contract is made. This ensures that the purchaser will not be forced to pay back a First Home Owner Grant because the cost of building the new home increased over the course of construction, resulting in the home's value exceeding that particular cap of $750,000.

For owner-builders, the commencement date is defined in the act as the date when the laying of the foundation commences or another date the commissioner considers appropriate in the circumstances. This maintains the current practise of owner-builders being eligible for receiving the First Home Owners Grant at an early stage in construction, rather than taking the approach as in New South Wales, where they calculate the value of a new home at the time of completion.

The second amendment provides clear rules relating to the calculation of transaction value for the different types of eligible transactions. For home building contracts and owner-builder constructions the values must include the cost of all materials used in construction and the market value of the land on which the home is built. This is consistent with section 9 of the Home Builder Grants Act 2020 and ensures all subcontracts and construction contracts are captured, even if they weren't part of the original contract. It is to prevent manipulation of land purchase prices. The amendment requires the market value of the land to be used in calculating the transaction value instead of the purchase price.

Subclause (b) outlines how the Commissioner for Taxation may determine market value, mirroring section 6 of the Home Builders Grant Act 2020. In the midst of a housing and budget crisis, we need public money to be spent equitably and in ways supported by evidence to achieve the best outcomes for public good. If a price cap is introduced, it will need to be monitored to ensure that it keeps pace with changing market conditions - and again, that is another recommendation of the Productivity Commission. I remind members of what they said: 'the use of price ceilings is consistent with the recommendation made by the commission in 2004' - 21 years ago - 'that ceilings be used to introduce a degree of targeting to the first homeowner scheme then in operation'.

I now point out to the House some statistics we were provided with in 2024. Maybe the Treasurer might have some more updated statistics but I believe what we have is the latest one. In 2024 mortgage lenders advised a parliamentary committee that the average first home buyer mortgage in Australia was $486 000, far less than $750 000. The 2023 report by the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, now Housing Australia, showed that the average purchase price for first home buyers in 2023 was $628 727, and for first home buyers accessing the federal home guarantee scheme, it was $503 311. 

In June 2025, the average value of a new loan for a first home buyer in Tasmania was $416 361, seasonally adjusted. In 2023-24 the average cost of completed homes in Tasmania was $411 245, and finally, the June 2025 quarterly report by the Real Estate Institute of Tasmania showed that in southern Tasmania, 21 first home buyers purchased land at a median price of $245 000, so not exceeding the $750 000. 

We are in a situation where we're having to make very difficult choices with our budget.
We're seeing community gardens and Neighbourhood Houses going without funding. Whilst it may seem a small amount in the grand scheme of things, is still an amount that we can achieve, that we can make as a saving by placing a cap. We can still target those most in need, but we're not providing what is essentially corporate welfare to the middle class to purchase homes in excess of $750 000. 

People can still purchase homes easily under that that price and can still avail themselves of this particular scheme, despite the fact that there is no evidence to show that it actually has increased housing affordability or increased the supply of housing in the market. If that is the government's wish, we should do that more responsibly by placing a cap and some constraints on this particular initiative.

Mr ABETZ - I indicated previously why the government was opposing all the amendments, so I invite people to refer back to my previous comments and also thank the member for Clark for not dividing the House on the previous amendment because it is saving us time. 

Mr WINTER - As previously outlined, I understand that the drafting of your amendment is that it be retrospective back to 1 July this year, meaning that people who were previously eligible for support would be ineligible. I repeat again the previous statement I made that I really do like the intent of what you've done here in terms of providing some guardrails and some means testing around this. The problem we've got is that we're here in November and we're talking about retrospectivity, which I think impacts the policy intent. I am more than happy to work with you around this issue for future financial years, but on this occasion I think it is too difficult and too late to add this sort of guardrail at this point of the financial year.

Mr BAYLEY - [Bookmark: Phr2_O=28.7_D=28.1_C=0.73]  I acknowledge that this is a similar debate to the motion that was just lost previously and this will presumably go the same way, but I do want to acknowledge the work the member has done in delivering some of the data about how this wouldn't impact on the scheme greatly in relation to the average value of houses that have been purchased under this scheme [Bookmark: Phr3_O=57.3_D=27.7_C=0.87]  in the past. From the Greens' perspective, we reiterate that there needs to be caps in relation to this kind of initiative and taxpayer support for the purchase of properties, given the budget situation and the desperate need of a whole range of different community sectors, including the housing sector, for additional support from the government. Given what we fear will be in the Budget on Thursday [Bookmark: Phr4_O=85.8_D=2.2_C=0.89] , it is wise to be putting in this kind of [Bookmark: Phr5_O=89.0_D=24.8_C=0.81]  constraint on a program such as this, notwithstanding acknowledging some of the retrospectivity challenges. 

We support the amendment and particularly the intent of it and, given the level of acknowledgement in this debate of the intent, notwithstanding the challenges, I think when we revisit this, as we will undoubtedly need to do over coming years [Bookmark: Phr6_O=114.6_D=2.4_C=0.90] , this could be something the government could [Bookmark: Phr7_O=118.2_D=4.2_C=0.86]  actively consider and work through in advance.

That the bill be now read the second time. 

This bill contains amendments that extend the operation of the Police Powers (Public Safety) Act 2005 and the Terrorism (Preventative Detention) Act 2005 for a period of 10 years to 31 December 2025. Both acts are due to expire at the end of this year.

 [Bookmark: Phr28_O=285.0_D=20.0_C=0.87] It is legislation like this that makes us pause and reflect about some of the biggest world events over the last 25 years and how we as a country and as a state responded. It also causes us to look forward and consider what protections are necessary to ensure our police, law enforcement, intelligence and prosecution agencies are appropriately equipped to respond to threats and acts of terrorism.

Following the 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre and Pentagon in the United States, and the 2002 Bali bombings, Australian States and Territories signed the Intergovernmental Agreement on Counterterrorism Laws in 2004. This led to the introduction of state-based counter-terrorism legislation to include the expansion of police powers in certain circumstances and a preventative detention regime. As a result, the Public Safety Act and the Preventative Detention Act were introduced in Tasmania in 2005. The introduction of the regime on a national basis was to ensure that there is consistency, in relation to the powers of available to our security agencies, and there are no vulnerabilities in the ability of any jurisdiction to protect its community against terrorist acts.

In Tasmania, the Public Safety Act provides police officers with necessary powers to ensure the safety of the public, where there is a potential terrorist threat to a significant event, a central infrastructure, or where a terrorist act has occurred. Following a grant of authorisation, police officers can stop, search and question people; search vehicles and seize and detain things. The Preventative Detention Act provides for an authorised person to seek the detention of a person for up to 14 days, in order to prevent an imminent terrorist act occurring, or to preserve evidence of, or relating to, a recent terrorist act.

Both acts contain appropriate safeguards. For example, the Public Safety Act requires approval of the Premier and in some cases the Supreme Court to exercise the range of powers. The Preventative Detention Act restricts multiple preventative detention orders being made and provides that a detainee may apply to the Supreme Court for revocation or variation of an order. 

A preventative detention order (PDO) cannot be made in relation to a person who is under 16 years of age, and the person detained is entitled to contact the Ombudsman and a lawyer to obtain legal advice. A person detained under a preventative detention order must be treated with humanity and respect for human dignity, and must not be subjected to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.

Neither act has been used in Tasmania to date. In fact, PDOs have been used sparingly around the country. This supports the intended purpose of the acts - to be extraordinary measures used in very serious circumstances. Three PDOs have been issued in NSW in 2014 and one in Victoria in 2015. Both acts were set to expire in 2015. On the 10th anniversary of the day of commencement, the acts include a sunset clause to ensure they will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, should they be remade. This is because of the extraordinary measures and powers provided for in the acts.

They depart from the usual warrant-based authorisation requirements and therefore governments around Australia have mandated they be reviewed regularly. They were extended to 31 December 2025 following the final report of the Council of Australian Government's Review of Counter Terrorism Legislation in 2013 and the second annual report of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor in 2012.

These reports agreed that PDOs should be retained, as their ongoing availability would ensure that law-enforcement agencies had a legal basis on which to take action to prevent a terrorist attack or preserve evidence in the immediate aftermath of a terrorist act - where an arrest or a prosecution is not considered to be open, but a person nonetheless presents a credible risk to public safety.

Some procedural and technical amendments were made to the Preventive Detention Act at this time. For example, providing that both the applicant and the senior police officer or Supreme Court must be satisfied that it is 'reasonably necessary' - as opposed to 'necessary' - to detain the person to preserve evidence relating to a terrorist act. Another change was enabling police officers to apply for PDOs orally or electronically in urgent circumstances. No substantive changes were made to the Public Safety Act.

Since 2015, there have been various reviews conducted in other states, as well as at the Commonwealth level. The Victorian government appointed an expert panel to consider terrorism and violent extremism prevention and response powers in 2017, which handed down two reports. In 2017 the New South Wales State Coroner handed down findings and recommendations from the inquest into the deaths arising from the Lindt Cafe siege in 2014.

Also in 2017, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor conducted reviews of the Commonwealth's police powers and preventative detention order (PDO) regime. In 2018 and 2021, the Commonwealth Joint Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security considered the Commonwealth's police powers and PDO regime.

The overall message of these various reviews is that a conclusion of redundancy does not automatically follow from the non-use of a particular law-enforcement tool. The reviews found that the powers afforded to police under the public safety act and the Terrorism (Preventative Detention) Act 2005 are necessary and should continue.

They are important tools in the belt for our police and other law enforcement, intelligence and prosecution agencies. This is supported by the position of other states and territories.

Equivalent legislation in Queensland expires in 2040; Victoria in 2031; the Australian Capital Territory in 2027; the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Northern Territory in 2026; South Australia and Western Australia at the end of 2025. South Australia intends to extend its legislation for 10 years and Western Australia for two years to synchronise their respective acts, which currently have different expiry dates.

Currently, Australia's general terrorism threat level is probable. That is, there is a greater than 50 per cent chance of an onshore attack or attack-planning in the next 12 months.

The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) notes and I quote: [tbc]

Australia's security landscape presented a vulnerable period and is being challenged by new threats with concerning trajectories. Our landscape is a reflection of the social and political environment in which we live.

RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

Members - Hear, hear.


TERRORISM LEGISLATION (EXTENSION) BILL 2025 (No. 52)

Second Reading

Continued from above.

Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice, Corrections and Rehabilitation) - Honourable Speaker, I certainly acknowledge the primary school students as well. It is great to have you here today. One day you could be standing here.

Before the lunch break I was part-way through the second reading speech on the Terrorism Legislation (Extension) Bill 2025. I was quoting the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and was partly through that quote, so I will continue as follows:

Our landscape is a reflection of the social and political environment in which we live. Social cohesion is lower and trust in governments and democratic processes globally is eroding.

ASIO is observing the emergence of domestic actors increasingly driven to action by sociopolitical issues intersecting with personal grievances. There is an increase in extremism fueled by conspiracy theories and anti-authority ideologies. Some actors hold a blend of ideologies, including those that justify acts of violence, to influence change. [tbc]

Although the threat to Tasmania and Australia has evolved since 2005, it remains real. It is marked by an increase in the threat of smaller-scale opportunistic attacks by lone actors and often driven by social media. For example, in the last couple of years we have seen in the media the first criminal prosecutions of persons conducting a Nazi salute in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, the first conviction of a person transmitting violent extremist material online in Western Australia, the Melbourne synagogue arson attack in December 2024 and various prosecutions of young people possessing violent extremist material in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.

The bill is important for this reason. It will retain Tasmania's security framework and preserve national consistency.

I will conclude by highlighting the ongoing work in this space across the country to ensure counterterrorism legislation remains fit for purpose. Western Australia is currently undertaking a statutory review of its legislation and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is undertaking a review of the definition of a terrorist act in the Commonwealth's Criminal Code Act 1995. Importantly, this definition is used in Tasmania's Public Safety Act and Preventative Detention Act. Relevant Tasmanian agencies are contributing to this review.

The government is committed to ensuring this legislation remains effective and will consider the findings of the various reviews in determining whether further reform of these acts in a future bill would improve their operation. I commend the bill to the House.

[2.33 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the Terrorism Legislation (Extension) Bill 2025. At the outset, I will thank the minister through his office for a briefing provided a couple of weeks ago by his department.

As we heard from the Attorney-General, the bill amends two pieces of legislation, the Police Powers (Public Safety) Act 2005 and the Terrorism (Preventable Detention) Act 2005. Those two pieces of legislation were introduced after the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City in 2001. The result of that action was, as we heard from the Attorney-General, legislation being passed by the Commonwealth and in each state and territory of laws that sought to provide a system or a regime to deal with what would happen if we saw something like that organised or planned for in Australia. They had a 10 year sunset clause, so this is the second time that that 10 year sunset clause has been extended. The first one was in 2015.

It is important to reflect on the circumstances that led to that legislation around the country being enacted and where we are now as a state and as a country. I have some history with this because I was working in Canberra in Parliament House at the time that first lot of legislation was enacted. I remember the time feeling a little bit like the early days of COVID. It felt very unpredictable, very confusing, and we knew that something was needed but we weren't quite sure what.

As a result, we've seen Commonwealth legislation in a range of different acts and acts being passed around each state and territory, but I think it is important to note that the circumstances that led to those pieces of legislation being drafted in the first place meant that they weren't inspected or intended necessarily to be enduring parts of our legislature or legislative statute book, and yet they have become enduring. I certainly recognise the need for that and we will be supporting the bill because terrorism still remains a threat to Australia and everywhere around the world and these are laws that are harmonised with other states and territories, which means that if we were to repeal ours, for example, we would be the missing link in the Australian context of having some harmonised laws that would allow the Commonwealth to deal with any potential terrorist threat that might be facing us as a country or different states and territories.

I think it's important to review these laws, and we know that there have been some reviews already done. New South Wales did one I think in 2023 and the ACT and Western Australia have reviews planned that we can learn from. I understand that the Tasmanian government will also be putting in place a review once this bill is passed, but those reviews need to really be cognisant of the fact that when those original laws were drafted they weren't expected to be enduring. By saying that, I mean we need to look at if this is the best way to deal with a potential terrorist threat. It may well be. It may well be that nothing needs to change, but it could be that we need to look, as we did with those COVID laws, at other enduring ways to deal with future potential threats.

Speaker, I wanted to share with the House some of the comments that have been made by people who are far more expert in this field than I. I will share from an article that was written by Professor George Williams in 2011 for the Melbourne University Law Review. He was writing this in the context of those laws having been in place for a decade at that time, so just before the first sunset clause was expiring. I will read a little bit of that in for the Chamber's interest. He starts the article by saying:

Australia has experienced a turbulent 10 years of enacting new laws to combat the threat of terrorism. Such laws have been introduced, often in great haste, in stunning scope and number.

At the federal level alone, over 50 new statutes, running into many hundreds of pages, have been passed by the federal parliament. This legislation has been of unprecedented reach, including laws providing for restrictions on freedom of speech through new sedition offences and broader censorship rules, and detention and questioning of up to a week by ASIO of Australian citizens not suspected of any crime, the banning of organisations by executive decision control orders that can enable house arrest for up to a year, detention without charge, or trial of up to 14 days, and warrantless searches of private property by police officers.

As these examples demonstrate, powers and sanctions once thought to lie outside the rules of a liberal democracy except during wartime have now become part of the Australian legal system.

Australia's anti-terror laws were enacted as a response to September 11 and subsequent terrorist attacks. As such, the laws were often cast as a temporary emergency reaction to these attacks and the possibility that such indiscriminate violence might be repeated at home. However, it is now clear that Australia's anti-terror laws can no longer be cast as a transient short-term legal response. This reflects the assessment of the Australian Government and its agencies that terrorism remains a persistent threat to the community. The National Terrorism Public Alert System has since 2003 said its threat level at 'medium,' indicating an assessment that a terrorist attack 'could' occur.

We heard from the Attorney-General that the Australian threat level is still rated as probable. I will go back to the article:

In 2010, the Australian government reiterated that 'the threat of terrorism in Australia is real and enduring. It has become a persistent and permanent feature of Australia's security environment.'

There are many prior examples of the federal parliament enacting national security legislation that conferred broad powers on government agencies and had a significant impact upon individual liberty. Such laws were typically found on the statute books during World Wars I and II. However, those conflicts were of a more definite duration and wartime legal measures ceased to operate after the conflict ended. By contrast, Australia's new anti-terror laws -

At the time they were new-ish.

have taken on a character of permanence. Indeed, what has been called the 'war on terror' has now run for a longer period than either of those worldwide conflicts, and continues unabated with no likely end in sight. Moreover, while a few anti-terror laws are the subject of 'sunset clauses' - 

Including these, Speaker.

that could see them lapse in a specific period of time unless reenacted, most have effect for an indefinite duration. [tbc]

I commend the article and the work of Professor Williams, who is an expert on what Australian parliaments did to deal with the threat of terrorism at that time. His work provides us with an important landscape and a template for how to look at these laws going forward. He gives some examples of migration of laws like this to other contexts.

For example, South Australia adapted this same model of prohibition and control orders to organised crime with their 2008 legislation called the Serious and Organised Crime (Control) Act 2008. That law allowed South Australia to declare certain organisations like bikie gangs as criminal, which enabled control orders to be made against their members. Other states, including New South Wales, Queensland and, indeed, Tasmania, have similar legislation on the books as well.

Professor Williams and his colleague, Rebecca Ananian-Welsh, also note that there has been a rhetorical shift with many people in different parliaments and in the media using language that used to be used to describe terrorist-like activity to describe bikie gangs, portraying them as essential threats to public safety.

By sharing this information, I'm not suggesting that the parliament shouldn't consider laws to deal with organised crime. Not at all. What I am saying, is that there has been arguably some legislative overreach or migration of this style of legislation to deal with other types of crime, and that's something that we need to be cognizant of as legislators.

I note that the legislation hasn't been used in Tasmania. That gives us some indication that there hasn't been a misuse of these laws in Tasmania since they were enacted in 2005. It doesn't mean, however, that we shouldn't be cognizant of the potential misuse of laws and overreach, which, as I said, is why a review of these laws is warranted.

In doing so, I will just note some of what was shared in Equality Tasmania's submission to the community consultation on this bill. They expressed concerns about the possibility of laws like these being misused to harass or persecute LGBTIQA+ Tasmanians, particularly trans and gender diverse people. They said that in a number of other countries, including Russia, LGBTIQA+ organisations have been designated as extremist or terrorist organisations simply because of their advocacy for equality and inclusion. Most recently, representatives of the United States' government have expressed a desire to do the same, with a strong focus on trans and gender diverse advocates and organisations in the United States. They explain that these kinds of stereotypes and suggestions are made despite the evidence showing that LGBTIQA+ people and trans and gender diverse people are far more likely to be victims of extremism and violence and crime than perpetrators.

There is no evidence that these laws have been used specifically to target LGBTIQA+ or any other group of Tasmanians, and I think Equality Tasmania would recognise that - in the materials to the bill show us that there hasn't been a need to use the provisions. The reason behind them providing a submission like this, however, is very important and should be front of mind when a review does occur, particularly in the current global context that we are in. They mentioned the United States. They go on to say that there are increasing calls from influential Americans and members of the United States' government to crack down on LGBTIQA+ and trans and gender diverse people, describing them and their organisations as extremists or terrorists. 

Similarly in the United Kingdom, we have seen Palestine Action organisation declared to be a terrorist organisation when it's actually a peaceful protest organisation standing up for Palestinian human rights and against genocide. When we see things like that, that kind of overreach of criminal law and misuse of laws that are intended to address something like the World Trade Center attacks, which is the genesis of this legislation, we need to be worried.

I think we can take comfort from the fact that these laws haven't been used in Tasmania, but it doesn't mean that we shouldn't be conscious of the potential for misuse. A review, which I understand will be conducted during the life of this revised bill, is really important. I want to put on the record in the Hansard today, for whatever positive purpose it might play to those who end up being tasked with that review, that I do hope that the reviewers will look at other jurisdictions, not just in Australia, but jurisdictions where there have been examples of that kind of legislative overreach and misuse.

It might be that we will end up with a much more functional legislative regime to deal with the obviously still present threat of terrorism, and it is important that we have harmonised laws across all Australian jurisdictions that can respond to those threats in an agile and rapid way. Equally, I don't think many of us in this place would like to see us go down the path that we've seen in the United States in particular, but as I said, there are examples in the United Kingdom and in Russia and elsewhere where laws like these have been used to vilify and persecute people in ways that were not intended at the time that those original laws were being drafted.

I have probably shared as much as I need to about the provisions of this bill. I understand that other members may have some amendments that I will consider in the course of the debate, and I'm interested in the government's views on those, and we will contribute to those amendment debates when the bill reaches its committee stage. I may have some questions to ask on other provisions during the committee stage, but at this point, at least, I will stop talking.

[2.49 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, this bill seeks to amend the Police Powers (Public Safety) Act 2005 and the Terrorism (Preventative Detention) Act 2005 to extend the powers brought in by those acts for an additional 10 years, and I will say at the outset that the Greens will be supporting this legislation and we have an amendment that I will get to and discuss shortly. 

It is always important to consider the context in which certain legislation was introduced. Minister, you noted the powers were instituted across Australia following the intergovernmental agreement on counter-terrorism laws in 2004 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.3_D=3.7_C=0.82]  that arose from the 11 September 2001 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.5_D=25.6_C=0.82]  attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States, as well as the 2002 Bali bombings. Those events are writ large in global consciousness. Since that time, terrorism has continued to be a prevalent threat across the globe. We don't take it lightly that ASIO has upgraded Australia's national terrorism threat level to [Bookmark: Phr4_O=58.0_D=3.8_C=0.76]  'probable', meaning there is a 50 per cent chance of an onshore attack [Bookmark: Phr5_O=62.1_D=28.0_C=0.87]  or attack-planning in the next 12 months. 

It's the responsibility of governments to act and sometimes to take extraordinary actions to keep citizens safe. We recognise that. We respect that. People want to feel safe in the community when they are going about their everyday life, when they're going into public places, when they're taking part in events, when they're going on public transport [Bookmark: Phr6_O=91.0_D=1.8_C=0.62] , where they're standing peacefully protest [Bookmark: Phr7_O=93.2_D=15.3_C=0.84] ing. All these situations require people to justifiably be able to feel safe. However, the United Nations Assembly did note that it is essential [Bookmark: Phr8_O=111.1_D=11.8_C=0.74]  to remember that, 'Effective counterterrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting goals, but complementary and mutually reinforcing.' That is obviously [Bookmark: Phr9_O=123.6_D=6.2_C=0.84]  the balance we're trying to strike here.

The Police Powers (Public Safety) Act 2005 gives authority to the police to, amongst other things, require that a person disclose their identity and arrest them without a warrant if they fail to comply; enter and search vehicles and premises without a warrant; seize and detain things without a warrant; to stop and search people without a warrant; and to conduct body cavity searches and strip searches without a warrant. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=160.9_D=16.0_C=0.87]  Most people would agree they are very broad powers. 

The Terrorism (Preventative Detection) Act 2005 allows the state to, in essence, deprive a person of their liberty for a crime that has not yet been committed. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=178.0_D=10.2_C=0.86]  These are actions that in ordinary circumstances are fiercely opposed by our rights-based system of law and have long been fiercely opposed [Bookmark: Phr13_O=189.4_D=25.0_C=0.89] . In extreme circumstances, we as a people may agree to derogate our rights in order to ensure the safety of the community, but those extreme circumstances cannot and should not go on forever, and they should not go on forever without forensic examination of whether they need to be [Bookmark: Phr14_O=215.4_D=0.7_C=0.97]  changed.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=217.0_D=16.8_C=0.81] Both acts contain sunset clauses that provide for the expiry of the legislation at a particular point in time. This bill would amend the sunset clauses to extend the operation of these powers by a further 10 years until 2035 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=234.2_D=15.9_C=0.81] . The Greens consider that to be a considerable extension of time, given the extraordinary nature of the principal acts. Minister, as you noted in your speech, sunset clauses are designed to ensure there is proper scrutiny by parliament if acts are to be remade. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=251.2_D=14.7_C=0.88]  In their submission on this bill, the Commission for Children and Young People noted that, unlike other jurisdictions, Tasmania has not completed a formal review of the principal act since they came into effect 20 years ago [Bookmark: Phr18_O=266.7_D=2.5_C=0.90] , unlike all other jurisdictions in Australia.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=270.4_D=21.4_C=0.88] I understand that it's the government's intention to review both the acts in the next year, perhaps with the support of the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute. The Greens think that is proper and in line with the intention of the original acts and also the broader international approach to terrorism laws in general.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=292.7_D=12.3_C=0.75] I want to quote a finding from the International Commission of Jurists Report of the Eminent Jurists Panel on Terrorism, Counter Terrorism and Human Rights. They observed a concerning drift of the extraordinary powers contained in terrorism legislation into the normal legislative framework. They said:

Much of the evidence suggested that these temporary and emergency responses tended to seep into other areas of law and negatively influence the institutional culture of the police, the legal system and the judiciary. [tbc]

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.7_D=1.7_C=0.82] It's critically important [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.3_D=21.6_C=0.85]  that parliament, the government, and the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute are able to properly scrutinise both of these acts before they're extended for a long period of time. It seems to us that a shorter extension period is appropriate to allow a proper review of both acts and their legislative frameworks.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=52.6_D=10.6_C=0.90] In this bill we will be moving amendments to reduce the length of extension from 10 years to three years. I want to explain why. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=63.9_D=14.3_C=0.85]  The Greens believe that three years will provide sufficient time to undertake a thorough review of the legislation and a buffer in case there are any delays, particularly to ensure the involvement of the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute [Bookmark: Phr6_O=79.3_D=4.8_C=0.93]  (TLRI). Some people would say three years is a long time to do this work [Bookmark: Phr7_O=85.3_D=7.2_C=0.79] . However, that seems reasonable given the role of the TLRI [Bookmark: Phr8_O=93.4_D=29.7_C=0.81] , not that I'm making any statement about the efficiency of their work, not at all. 

As noted by the minister, other jurisdictions in Australia have continued the operation of these acts for a variety of time periods. Queensland expires in 2040, Victoria in 2031, the Australian Capital Territory in 2027, the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Northern Territory in 2026 and South Australia and Western Australia at the end of this year. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=124.0_D=16.6_C=0.79]  Three years is a timeframe that's consistent with other jurisdictions, as well as consistent with recommendations on similar provisions from the Federal Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Securities review of police powers in relation to terrorism [Bookmark: Phr10_O=141.2_D=5.4_C=0.78] , which the minister mentioned himself in his contribution.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=147.8_D=29.4_C=0.81] It's also consistent with the view of the Law Council of Australia, who have said in relation to similar federal legislations -

 The extraordinary nature of the relevant powers in departing from the usual warrant-based authorisation requirements means that their continued necessity must be reviewed regularly. The Law Council notes that a three-year period of effect is preferable to any longer period of operation. [tbc]

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=178.5_D=16.3_C=0.86] Extending these acts to 2028 will ensure that Tasmania is broadly consistent with other states and territories and ensure that the police have necessary powers in the short term, while providing the time for a proper and thorough legislative review [Bookmark: Phr13_O=195.7_D=1.4_C=0.83] , which may recommend [Bookmark: Phr14_O=197.9_D=8.2_C=0.87]  extending that sunset clause further, or indeed doing away with sunset clauses altogether and making these provisions permanent.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=207.6_D=14.0_C=0.83] On balance, that is probably unlikely, but the point is we don't know what a review will recommend until it's undertaken. We don't consider it's appropriate to continue these extraordinary powers for another 10 years unchallenged.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=222.8_D=29.6_C=0.80] The final point I want to make continues with some of the comments that the honourable Ella Haddad made. It's something that was raised by Equality Tasmania in their submission to the draft bill and brings me to my earlier point about understanding the context in which legislation is introduced. We're in a markedly different environment now with regard to terrorism than we were following the September 11 attacks.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=252.9_D=22.2_C=0.79] The scale and nature of threats have changed, as has ASIOs categorisation of who or what is considered a threat - very different. We can't ignore the escalation of far-right extremisms that's accelerated in recent years, particularly since the election of Donald Trump and the COVID-19 pandemic.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=276.1_D=27.2_C=0.81] In every annual terrorism threat assessment since 2019, the Director General of ASIO, Mike Burgess, has observed an increase in the terror threat from far-right extremists. Young people, including in Australia, are being radicalised online by the far right and they're being aided and funded by famous figures such as Elon Musk, Alex Jones, Tommy Robertson and Jack Posobiec. 

I note that to demonstrate just how significantly our understanding of terrorism has changed since this legislation was first introduced - a completely different and new category of people. Of course, we can't have this debate without acknowledging that right-wing governments globally - but especially and infamously in the United States - are also using terrorism legislation to declare predominantly left-wing antifascist organisations as domestic terrorists. ASIO has noted that left-wing extremism is not prominent in Australia.

As Equality Tasmania has noted, in some countries, including Russia, LGBTI organisations have been designated as extremist or terrorist organisations, simply because of the advocacy for LGBTIQA+ equality and inclusion. Equality Tasmania goes on to say:

Stereotypes, misinformation and misperceptions about LGBTIQA+ people, extremism and terrorism create the real possibility of LGBTIQA+ people, especially transgender people, being targeted under anti-terrorism laws. This could take the form of harassment by particular law enforcement officers or persecution by a future government. [tbc]

I'm not suggesting that this government or the department would use the extension of these acts to target LGBTIQA+ Tasmanians, but it's important to consider how these laws could be used in the worst-case scenario. I note and endorse the concern that Ms Haddad raised about people who are peaceful activists protesting about the Australian government's lack of action for Palestinian people, wanting to make statements about the complicity of all Australians in the genocide that's occurring, being swept up as being anti-Semitic when really they're just speaking about the reality of the circumstances that are happening. 

That is a thread of conversation in Australia, as well as in countries overseas. We need to take that seriously. We need to make sure that people who are making genuine, peaceful statements are expressing the reality of what's happening, an uncomfortable reality for some, but a necessary conversation to have as part of a community of people upholding our rights to protest, to speak and to be able to hold peaceful public meetings. They're really important values to hold on to and now is the time to support them more than ever.

These are worst-case scenarios, but given the trends that we're seeing internationally, I believe the comments I'm making reflect the concerns of the community to strike a balance. We want to keep Tasmanians safe and the amendment we're looking at would do that. It would not remove any laws, it would bring forward the process of review and put a very clear timeline on when it would need to be done by, with the possibility of having that sunset clause extended if necessary, if for some reason things weren't conducted in that time. I think it's very unlikely that a review couldn't be undertaken within three years, but there's always the possibility of coming back if that hadn't happened, not that I'm encouraging that.

There is no change to the situation in terms of keeping Tasmanians safe, but neither is there a laxity about focusing on reviewing these very substantial powers that are available to the police and other authorities. Ten years is a long time for the community to have a fear held over their heads that powers could be misused and we want to make sure that they are reviewed and where necessary strengthened and focused, where they need to be focused to keep people safe.

Recognition of Visitors

The SPEAKER - Honourable members, I'd like us to welcome the second group of years 5 and 6 students from Andrews Creek Primary School. Welcome all, to parliament.

Members - Hear, hear.
———————————————————
[3.05 p.m.]
Mr RAZAY (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I would also like to make a contribution to the proposed terrorism legislation bill which amends the Police Powers (Public Safety) Act 2005 and the Terrorism (Preventative Detention) Act 2005 to extend their operation until 31 December 2025. 

Since the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, Australia has introduced 40 new counterterrorism laws. The Australian Human Rights Commission has highlighted how human rights may be infringed by counterterrorism laws, including how these laws can have a profound impact on fundamental human rights and freedom, including the right to a fair trial, the right to freedom from arbitrary detention and arrest, the right not to be subject to torture, the right to privacy, the right to freedom of association and expression and the right to non-discrimination. 

Given neither act has been utilised in Tasmania to date since being introduced in 2005, and in light of the profound impact such counterterrorism laws can have on fundamental human rights and freedom, I have an amendment to consider during our debate to extend the act for a period of five years rather than 10 years to allow the government time to review the principal acts before proposing to extend the operation of acts for a longer period. 

An extension between two and five years would better mirror the extension of counterterrorism legislation in some other jurisdictions, including the Commonwealth framework, which extended counterterrorism legislation for a period of three years until 2026, and likewise Western Australia, which extended the counterterrorism legislation for a period of two years till 2027. 

[3.07 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I will be brief in my contribution because I think the issues around this bill have been eloquently addressed by colleagues previously. Suffice it to say that they have highlighted the tension between community safety and public safety, and human rights, and making sure we find the particularly right balance in this. When we're conferring extraordinary powers, as others have said, that include the authority to detain individuals without charge and to stop, search and seize property without the ordinary thresholds of suspicion that would otherwise apply, we need to make sure we are doing all we can to be contemporary in the way we balance that particular extension of power with human rights. 

As others have done, I flag that I will be looking at and supporting amendments to review the sunset period on this bill. I think it's important that we ensure what we have before us is a contemporary bill when we're exercising such extraordinary powers, but I'll also flag my intention to move a motion before we move to committee where I will ask the committee to consider an addition to the bill, which would in fact provide the protections of the OPCAT Implementation Act to those subject to this particular bill. 

As others have indicated, we need to make that balance very clear with human rights. We were nation-leading here in Tasmania when we implemented the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021. I believe this would enhance and strengthen the terrorism bill we have before us and add to it in terms of oversight when we are exercising such extraordinary coercive powers and impacting on human rights. I'd just like to flag that at this moment for consideration soon.

[3.09 p.m.]
Mr GEORGE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I won't take up much of the House's time. At least the Attorney-General has recognised the fact that these are extraordinary powers and it needs to be clear that overreach by both governments and authorities such as the police, is not constrained merely to repressive regimes. We've seen the overreach of police around Australia and around other democratic countries over the past few years in pursuit of those who may commit a terrorist act. This means that under this legislation, it is possible to stop, detain, search, and incarcerate people without necessarily being able to produce reasonable cause before a court.

It's easy to abuse laws like this, however, they're clearly necessary. I note the fact that they've never actually been used in the years that they've been in effect in Tasmania. However, a sunset clause of 10 years is far too long. The human rights institutions all agree that a 10 year term is far too long in a modern world.

I rise to support my friend Prof Razay, who has suggested five-year term. Five years takes us to the end and a little bit beyond the term of this particular parliament. That seems to be a reasonable time for this legislation to be put into force, to be considered, to see if it is necessary to have it at all. In five years' time we will have a new parliament and a new parliament will have the opportunity to revisit this question.

I recommend to the Attorney General that he considers a five-year term rather than a 10-year term.

[3.12 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Attorney-General) - Honourable Speaker, I want to acknowledge and thank the honourable members for their contributions on this important legislation and timely legislation, and acknowledge the goodwill in the Chamber, the collaboration in the Chamber, and to speak to these important matters.

I acknowledge Ms Haddad and her role in Canberra when she was acting up there as an advisor, I assume, in that role and indicate that was a tough time for our nation in and around 9/11 and responding to that terrorist act which killed many Australians, hundreds, indeed, and 2700-plus Americans and many others. Of course, I was there in the Senate since February 2002 and was part of the response to the Bali Bombings, which was so impactive on our country. I know people in this Chamber and others outside the Chamber will remember those events and the response to it, which was heartfelt, meaningful, but it was also collaborative across the nation, federal and then state and territory governments responded appropriately, I believe, in the following years. Out of that you have the anti-terrorism legislation and as has been fairly, I think, outlined by the various speakers today. I acknowledge that.

I also acknowledge the Melbourne synagogue bombings masterminded by the Iranian government. This is on the public record. I mentioned it briefly in my second reading speech. This is in recent times. This has happened in recent times, and we need to be prepared. It's been well explained by many of those who contributed to this debate that these laws have not been used in Tasmania at all in those past two decades. I acknowledge that up front. Of course, it's hard to have a review when the laws haven't actually been used. However, they have been used in other states and action has been taken.

I will cut to the quick and in my summing up opportunity respond to the suggestion of a tighter timeframe. I acknowledge Peter George, Prof Razay, Kristie Johnston, and Dr Woodruff's calls in that regard and speaking in favour of that. I indicate as a government that we don't support reducing the timeframe. I will give you a heads up, but I will also respond to Ms Johnston's response regarding the OPCAT implementation, and I will speak to that shortly as well.

Whether it's two years, three years, five years - we don't support that. However, let me outline some of the reasons why, if that's okay, to assist in the summing up. Then during committee we can have further discussions, if that's the will of the Chamber.

It's preferred to extend the acts for 10 years in this bill and to allow the review, which I think, again, has been mentioned and I will speak more about the review to progress separately, recognising that unforeseen events can occur which make tight statutory timeframes difficult to comply with.

Why is it proposed to extend the act for 10 years? Why not a shorter period while the review is being conducted? As my shadow has noted and as well-known to others, it's been extended previously for 10 years, so it's now a 20-year process, and we're extending for a further 10 years. That's the plan in this legislation.

First of all, the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Services has requested the 10-year extension. That's consistent with the approach taken in most other Australian jurisdictions. For example, Queensland has extended to 2040; Victoria to 2031; South Australia has a bill before the parliament proposing a 10year extension. Ten years is a good timeframe for issues to be identified and a review to be undertaken, particularly noting that this legislation has never been used and is intended to provide measures of last resort, and I think we'd all agree with that.

I just wanted to at this time concur and take up the thoughts expressed by Prof Razay in terms of the freedoms that we enjoy in Australia today: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to express a view different to others, and the various freedoms that Prof Razay spoke so eloquently in support of. I believe most in the Chamber would agree with the importance of preserving those various freedoms. I acknowledge that as well. Certainly, given the current national security threat level in Australia, and I've said before in this place and it's publicly on the record, it's moved from 'possible' to 'probable' based on an ASIO advice just in the last 12 months, so that certainly gives rise to some concerns.

In terms of the terrorist-related activity that has occurred in the last few years: I've just mentioned the bombings in other states promulgated by the Iranian government driven by anti-Semitic objectives. The findings of other state and territory statutory reviews have been conducted recently, and it is unlikely that a review will conclude the acts are not required. However, it is acknowledged that they can be improved and there will be a review, and I will outline some of the thoughts about that as well.

In terms of the review, which I believe has been acknowledged, thank you, Dr Woodruff and others in terms of the merit of the review. I note that at the briefings on the bill which have been offered by myself through my department, which is excellent and appreciated, advice was provided that the acts in question would be reviewed by either the Department of Justice or the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute (TLRI). The Department of Justice has already commenced considering the operation of the acts. I've had further discussions with my department, and I can indicate that the capacity of the TLRI is not high, meaning they're very busy doing a lot of work in a whole range of areas which are important to law reform in Tasmania. But I can advise that the Department of Justice will continue to conduct the review. I can advise and will continue to advise and be very open about this and commit to a review of the legislation, including a process for community engagement and feedback from stakeholders and others, to provide a submission. We are looking at doing that review - conducting it, getting that feedback - in the first half of next year, with a view to possible/probable amendments in the second half of next year, 2026. That's the view of the government and the plan at this stage is to progress any legislative amendments in the second half of 2026.

The department will build on the work that has already been done, seek the views of the community as well as Justice stakeholders. The department will consider the findings of statutory reviews that are currently underway in Western Australia and, I'm advised, the Australian Capital Territory. We will be watching to see what responses are, and to see if we can learn from those reviews in other jurisdictions. The issues raised in the submissions from consultation on this bill will be considered as part of the review.

The review will also enable the Department of Justice to engage with other jurisdictions through the Inter-Jurisdictional Counter-Terrorism Legal Issues working group. That's a very long name for a working group, but it notes that the Commonwealth, New South Wales and the Northern Territory's Preventative Detention regimes are due to expire in 2026. This is an inter-jurisdictional - federal and all the various states and territories - Counter Terrorism Legal Issues Working Group. A senior member of our department has a very senior role in that working group, who happens to be sitting on the advisors desk there and many in this Chamber know Bruce very well. Thank you, Bruce, for your role in that working group.

That will inform the views of our government and, hopefully, in due course, the parliament, about the merit of the review and what would come out of that review, in the report and recommendations, which will be made available to this parliament in due course. It is difficult to review legislation, as I indicated, that's never been used in Tasmania before. It's important to learn lessons from other jurisdictions where these serious powers have been utilised.

I note that if the review concludes that the length of time for which the acts are extended should be amended, the government will consider these findings and make the necessary amendments at that time. I'm talking about the second half of next year, if that was to progress. This ensures that any change to the current approach, is informed by a thorough review into the operation of the acts and the powers they confer.

It is also important that any changes we make to the Tasmanian acts are made with due consideration to maintaining a harmonised framework, with the rest of Australia. I have indicated that most other Australian states have that long-term approach and that 10 years is deemed appropriate in terms of the harmonised framework with the rest of Australia, and not in any way that may unintentionally create gaps that expose the Tasmanian community to terrorist activities. That's something that we don't want, I'm sure members in this Chamber have a similar view on that, that we do need to protect the community interest and ensure that the community is kept safe.

Before I sum up, in general, I want to respond to the independent member for Clark, Kristie Johnston's intention, as outlined in her remarks, to amend the principal acts to make it clear that the acts do not prevail over the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 to the extent of an inconsistency. The first thing I'd say is, based on advice I've received, that's out of scope for the bill. I know the bill is to extend for a further 10 years, that's the advice I've received, it's out of scope of the bill. Therefore, the government doesn't support the amendment.

In regard to the intent of the amendment, if I can just speak to that, for one moment. The government notes that it has reviewed the amendment, and doesn't support it, because it is unnecessary. Section 7 of the OPCAT act already provides for the same thing. It's headed 'Relationship to Other Laws' -

A provision of any Act that prevents, or limits, the exercise of any function by a Tasmanian national preventive mechanism or the Subcommittee, with respect to a detainee or place of detention in accordance with this Act, has no effect or operation to the extent of any inconsistency with this Act.

The OPCAT act does prevail in each case.

In summary, the government notes there is nothing in either of the acts being amended that would interfere with this. I draw that to your attention, we can't see the merit of it and we don't support that, but thank you for bringing it forward and we totally respect your rights. That is the sort of thing that could come up in the review next year.

In summing up, I certainly want to put on the record my sincere thanks to Alice Lynch, Bruce Paterson and Peter Davish from the department. I appreciate their support for myself as Attorney-General and my office as well.

I want to indicate those who made submissions during the consultation. There have been references to a number of submitters in the debate today, so thank you for that. The department consulted directly with the following: the Chief Justice, the Chief Magistrate, Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management, the Department of Education, Children and Young People, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the interim Commissioner for Children and Young People, the Ombudsman, the Law Society of Tasmania, Civil Liberties Australia, and Equality Tasmania. We've had targeted consultation to get that feedback. Other government departments and legal and community stakeholders were directly consulted as well.

In summary, the Police Powers (Public Safety) and the Terrorism (Preventative Detention) acts are being amended to extend their operation for a period of 10 years to 31 December 2035.

As terrorism and violent extremism around the world endures, it is important that Tasmania's security framework remains in place. The Public Safety and Preventative Detention acts, provide Tasmania Police and other authorised police officers with the necessary powers to respond to terrorist acts or potential terrorist acts. The bill will preserve national consistency, which is important to enable Australia's police and law enforcement, intelligence and prosecution agencies to prevent terrorist acts occurring and investigate and prosecute those who commit acts of terrorism or who seek to commit such acts.

I commend the bill to the House. I thank those for bringing forward their views and thoughts and likewise for the heads up of views to be expressed in committee.

Bill read the second time.


MOTION

Terrorism Legislation (Extension) Bill 2025 (No. 52) - Consideration of Amendments Outside of the Scope of the Bill

[3.28 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 279, I move -

That the Committee of the Whole House be instructed to consider provision for necessary amendments to the Terrorism Legislation (Extension) Bill 2025 (No 52) in respect of matters relating to human rights protections.

The reason I am moving this motion is that I have sought and received advice from the Clerk of the House as to the intent of my amendments, and she has confirmed to me that the intent of the amendments are a little outside of the scope of this bill, however they are cognate to the purpose of the bill, and so it is in order for the House to instruct the committee of the whole to consider these amendments if it wishes.

As I outlined before, the purpose of my amendments is to make explicit that, despite granting law enforcement extraordinary additional powers, including preventative detention, robust human rights protections remain. This balance is a real concern to the community members I speak to and is also reflected in a number of submissions to this bill.

The Terrorism Legislation Extension Bill 2025 seeks to extend the operation of the Police Powers (Public Safety) Act 2005 and the Terrorism (Preventative Detention) Act 2005. These laws confer extraordinary powers, including the authority to detain with individuals without charge and to stop and search, and to seize property without the extraordinary thresholds of suspicion that would otherwise apply.

As the bill prolongs a life for these exceptional measures, it is both reasonable and necessary that committee be permitted to consider amendments to ensure adequate human right protections are embedded within the legislation and the principal acts it extends. Such amendments would not obstruct or diminish the intended effect of the bill, rather, they would strengthen it by aligning Tasmania's counter-terrorism framework with Australia's international obligations under the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT). Cross-referencing the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 within the terrorism and public safety legislation would make clear that the exercise of these coercive powers must be consistent with fundamental human rights standards. I recognise the Attorney-General's contribution in regard to it already being referenced within the OPCAT, but for the avoidance of doubt, this is why I'm seeking it be included in this particular act itself. 

In short, this instruction enables the Committee to consider reasonable cognate amendments that safeguard the rights and dignities of individuals by preserving the intent of the bill to protect public safety. I hope members will agree to give this consideration in Committee. 

[3.30 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice, Corrections and Rehabilitation) - Honourable Speaker, as I've indicated in my summing up, we won't be supporting this particular motion. I appreciate you bringing it forward for the two reasons I've outlined very clearly, that it's outside the scope of the bill and there will absolutely be an opportunity during the review in the first half of next year to consider the matters that you've raised. 

Second, in terms of OPCAT, section 7, as I've outlined in my summary, absolutely makes it clear that it cannot prevail over the OPCAT act. For those reasons, the government doesn't support this particular motion. I thank the House.

Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I'm going to speak to this now because if this motion doesn't pass, it means we can't consider the amendments. Is that right? 

A member - That's right.

Ms HADDAD - Okay. I don't have a problem with supporting the motion to consider the amendments. I myself have put amendments in the past that were arguably outside the scope of the bill, and the parliament supported me to do that, but I just want to speak to the content of the amendments in case this motion doesn't pass. Is that in order, Speaker, if I speak briefly to the content of the amendments at this point?

The SPEAKER - We have to decide on the motion before the House, which is that the whole House be instructed to consider those -

Ms HADDAD - Okay. In that case I will indicate that we'll support the motion to consider the amendments. I do have some questions about the amendments that we might not get to if the motion to support the amendments doesn't pass, so I will keep those for that point if we get to it.

Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, the Greens will support these amendments being considered.

Motion agreed to.


TERRORISM LEGISLATION (EXTENSION) BILL 2025 (No. 52)

In Committee

Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to.

Ms JOHNSTON - Deputy Chair, I move -

New clause A to follow clause 3. 

Insert the following clause A.

Section 4 inserted. After clause 3 of the principal act, the following section is inserted in part 1 - 

(4)	relationships to other laws. 

For the avoidance of doubt -

(a)	This act does not prevent or limit the exercise of a function or power by a Tasmanian national preventative mechanism or the subcommittee with respect to a detainee or place of detention in accordance with the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 within the meaning of that act; and

(b)	If there is an inconsistency between this act and the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021, that act prevails the extent of the inconsistency. [tbc]

I spoke to this a little when we sought leave to be able to consider this particular amendment within the Committee part of this bill and really did highlight that this is basically just ensuring that we have an alignment between some very important acts that protect and also infringe on individuals' human rights. I recognised that we were a leading jurisdiction in the adoption of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 and that, as the Attorney-General said in his contribution earlier, the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 would apply in these particular circumstances, I think it's very important that this parliament, when it is extending the exercise of extraordinary powers and infringements on human rights for very good reasons, that it reflects and refers back to the human right protections that are available to individuals. This is an very important piece of work and act that would have oversight in the event that these extraordinary powers are ever utilised in Tasmania.

I highlight that a number of submitters have raised concerns and have also recognised that the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 provides significant protections and oversight, so I would recommend and commend to the House this particular amendment in addition.

Mr BARNETT - Thank you very much for putting forward those remarks. My earlier remarks remain. It is unnecessary. The OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 does prevail. Section 7 makes it very clear and I've outlined that section to the Chamber. It says:

A provision of any other Act that prevents, or limits, the exercise of any function by a Tasmanian national preventive mechanism or the Subcommittee, with respect to a detainee or place of detention in accordance with this Act, has no effect or operation to the extent of any inconsistency with this Act.

That's the view of the government and the advice I have received. In light of the time, I don't wish to delay the Chamber and will respect the views of the Chamber, but I see it as unnecessary. I acknowledge the views of the Independent member for Clark with respect to Tasmania leading the nation in 2021 in introducing OPCAT into this great state of Tasmania. I will just pause there for one moment.

Chair, I have further advice from the department which it makes it clear that the amendment is particularly unnecessary in the Police Powers (Public Safety) Act as the act doesn't include detention powers. Obviously, the primary bill deals with two bills, one of which is the Police Powers (Public Safety)Act, which doesn't include detention powers, so it's particularly unnecessary in that regard.

Ms HADDAD - I want to make a very brief contribution. I absolutely appreciate and understand the arguments that my colleague from Clark, Ms Johnston, has put forward and the importance, as we all said in the debate, of the balance between protecting community and our human rights obligations and rights protection.

I was also glad when Tasmania acted quickly in 2021 to adopt the OPCAT legislation that we did, and we supported that. You mentioned a human rights act as well and it remains Labor policy that a human rights act is needed in Tasmania.

While I'm usually a fan of avoidance of doubt clauses, I do have a worry about this one in light of what the minister has said in that section 7 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 means that it already prevails over any other legislation. My only worry about overtly mentioning it in this legislation is that if we do it in this act, we should do it everywhere in any other legislation; if we're making it over here, we should make it overt in every other piece of legislation that allows for detention.

Either that or we trust the provisions of the OPCAT Act which say it prevails. My thoughts are not very well put together, but that's my gut feel on the very worthy intent of this legislation. However, the potential, possible unintended consequence of meaning that it might by implication give readers of our legislation and other acts that allow for detention to believe that there isn't an expressive intention for the OPCAT regime to oversee those other pieces of legislation. Does that make sense? Okay.

Dr WOODRUFF - The Greens will be supporting this amendment. Thank you to Ms Johnston for bringing it in.

I will make my explanation - it is that Tasmania is a leading jurisdiction in Australia and it is a new law; 2021 was an important date for Tasmania making a statement and signing on effectively in the reality of standing up against torture and speaking to our commitment to international obligations. It is about the creation of an independent body that will regularly visit people who are deprived of liberty to prevent torture and other mistreatment. It enables the conduct of visits of people who have been detained. It enables interviews with them. It allows the implementation monitor to make recommendations to authorities, to publish the thoughts, to improve conditions and treatments. It's very important. It is a new body.

Ms Haddad, I listened to what you said. I hear what you're saying. However, I don't believe there are that many other pieces of legislation where detention occurs. It is okay to make something overt in an act when acts are read as standalone bodies as well as intersecting with other acts. However, I believe that, because it's such a new and important body, the OPCAT implementation monitor and that role in Tasmania and to prioritise the importance of that, I see no problems with having this for an avoidance of doubt in here. I don't think it in any way detracts from any other legislation which empowers the government to detain people if it's not there. If that legislation comes to parliament for amendment, for some other reason, I believe we should consider inserting it. I believe it needs to be given a privileged status because it's new, because it's important, and I genuinely think it's unlikely that it's going to cause confusion by having it in here and not another act.

I believe people aren't going to be looking at another act and going it doesn't have OPCAT in there, therefore, it doesn't -

You couldn't make a legal case, could you, because you'd have to say that the OPCAT Implementation Act didn't have Section 7 in it.

I believe it's a good thing; it's a new law; it's a very important law. It is about the people who, for example, with this terrorism legislation, as we've all agreed in this Chamber, it is manifestly important that we have these laws and powers, but it also must be balanced by making sure that they are being used in a way which is appropriate. All this does is it gives an independent body the opportunity to make an assessment of people who have been detained, which under terrorism legislation is without warrant so it just gives that opportunity for an extra level of oversight.

We do support it.

Ms JOHNSTON - I thank members for their contribution. In relation to the concerns raised by my colleague, the member for Clark, the honourable Ella Haddad, I do understand the concerns raised. It is a tricky thing to get your head around conceptually in terms of finding that right balance between having things repeated in multiple acts. However, as the honourable Leader of the Greens, Dr Woodruff, has outlined, it doesn't detract or cause necessary confusion, and given the extraordinary nature of the powers conferred in this, but in the principal act, it is extra important that it is reiterated for the avoidance of doubt that the OPCAT Implementation Act does apply in this particular instance.

I would also argue - and I know the honourable Ella Haddad is a passionate advocate for human rights, as I am - that we should, as a parliament, at every opportunity insert more protections for human rights, particularly when we're dealing with the infringements of human rights or the taking away of individual powers. This is an important opportunity that we have before the parliament at this particular point in time to insert this provision for the avoidance of doubt.

I would hope, as Dr Woodruff has indicated, that should there be other bills coming before this House where we deal with detention in other settings, that we likewise turn our mind to the human right implications of detention, of searches and things like that, and make sure it's explicit in those acts as well, that there are human rights protection. 

This is an important opportunity to draw a line in the sand and to also make it very explicit that whilst we do appreciate the need for community and public safety, and we are prepared to extend powers to this extent, we do expect that there be compliance with human rights obligations as well.

Clause 4 -
Section 34 (Expiry of Act)

Dr WOODRUFF - Deputy Chair, I foreshadowed this amendment, and I will read it into the Bill. I move -

Page 4, clause 4.

Leave out '2035'.

insert instead '2028'.

I made my points for this pretty clear in the second reading that I gave. It's clear that the government has signalled its intention to do a review next year. That's what I think I heard you say again, minister. We certainly got that advice in the briefing that we had, and thank you to the staff for the briefing. You've committed to the government doing a review of this by next year. Just on the basics of it, there's absolutely no argument then to extend the legislation for 10 years when you've committed to doing a review on it next year.

We could be moving now to have a sunset clause on this bill for one year, but that seems to be manifestly unreasonable. Things don't go to plan. You've committed to doing a review by the end of next year. What we're proposing is a three-year sunset clause. Just so all the members will be clear: the situation will be that South Australia and Western Australia are going to have amended their legislation. They're committing to do it by the end of this year.

Northern Territory, New South Wales and the Commonwealth are going to amend theirs by the end of next year. The Australian Capital Territory will have done it by 2027. We're proposing in this amendment to have it done by the end of 2028. Therefore, Tasmania is the outlier. All we're talking about doing is, not changing the law, not weakening the law, but putting a firm three-year extension for when a review is to be completed. Given the government has already said that you're planning on doing it by the end of next year, I think there is a fair amount of wriggle room for the things that can reasonably go awry for lots of reasons - TLRI, government staff, other issues. That's all fair and cool. That's why we've come up with three years. It's not too small, it's not too large, it's just in the sweet spot of trying to get the balance. Ten years is not that sweet spot, and I think that's pretty clear.

Mr BARNETT Deputy Chair, I thank Dr Woodruff for putting on the record your amendment, which we made clear in my summing up. We don't support three years. We don't support two years. We don't support five years. We support 10 years, which is what's in the bill. That's why we've worked so hard to get this bill forward as quickly as possible to ensure that we can roll it over by 31 December this year for a 10-year period, which will be consistent with other jurisdictions.

I've made clear Queensland's now extended to 2040. Victoria to 2031, South Australia has a bill before it proposing 10 years. Ten years is a good timeframe, and of course these are measures that are to be used as a last resort. I make the point that they have never been used in the last 20 years. They've been rolled over since day dot. This is the second time - for a further 10-year period, so it will take it for a further 10 years. It's consistent with the two previous bills. 

I am responding to the Independent member for Franklin, Peter George's, comments earlier. Just to make it very clear, it has not been used at all and it's to preserve our security and safety in Tasmania, consistent with the rest of the nation. It's really important that we stick to the plan and have the review next year. I've indicated on the public record that there will be a review, getting feedback, particularly in the first half of the year, and then coming back to this parliament with what comes through from that report and recommendation. So there will be plenty of opportunity for further comment or feedback, and that will be towards the second-half of next year. 

We have the interjurisdictional committee, which is federal, state and territory jurisdictions. We are represented on that. That needs to take its place, and there are other reviews that are taking place. We can learn from other jurisdictions where it has been used. It hasn't been used in Tasmania, so we can learn from other jurisdictions where it has been used and respond accordingly. Ten years is what it has been, the last two lots of 10 years, and we're rolling it over consistent with other jurisdictions and we support that plan. 

We don't support the amendment of Dr Woodruff and the Greens. I commend that view to the House. 

Ms HADDAD - Chair, I remain really undecided about this because I'm absolutely taking in good faith what the Attorney-General has shared with the House, which is that the work of a review is already underway in the Department of Justice, that national work is going on through the Interjurisdictional Counterterrorism Working Group that's doing work right now and currently, and that the Attorney-General has the intention to conclude the review next year and to seek to move amendments in this place in the second half of 2026. To my mind, that really means that it shouldn't really be an impediment to any of that work continuing on a timeframe of three years rather than 10 years. 

I want to reflect again on the time between 2001, when the 11 September attacks occurred, and shortly after there were the Bali bombings, and then this legislation in 2005. A 10-year sunset clause was viewed as a really long time back when those original pieces of legislation were being put in place, but parliaments around the country, including the Commonwealth, did so because of the extraordinary nature of what the globe was seeing at that time with those terrifying events taking place.

However, it isn't right for us to simply extend sunset clauses without further review, which is why I shared the words of George Williams in my substantive contribution. He recognises, of course, that these laws are now part of our longer-term legislation around the country and the world. That's not in contention here, but from my perspective there are two pathways forward.

There is an argument - and the Leader of the Greens alluded to it in her substantive contribution - to say if we need these laws in an ongoing sense, then make them a permanent part of our legislation, a permanent part of our statute books. Do the review. The review may suggest more temporary legislation with a long or short sunset clause, or it might indeed recommend that we need something permanent on our statute books to deal with the ongoing evolving threat of terrorism in the different ways it appears nowadays. It is different now; there's all sorts of online threats that weren't in the thinking of parliaments back in 2005.

Alternatively, I suppose I want some more answers from you, Attorney-General, with respect, to ask why three years isn't enough. That's the crux of my question. Why is either three years or five years not enough, considering that the work's already underway? If, by chance, a three-year sunset clause is what the parliament agrees to today and that work isn't complete, the government will know that in enough time to come back with a bill to extend the sunset clause, say by another three years, to accommodate that work. 

I'm not trying to be tricky here at all. I'm genuinely putting my views, having heard both arguments on the record here today, but I haven't yet been convinced as to why three years isn't enough time to do that review, considering it's already begun. If the Attorney-General said the review is planned for 2027 and this is what's in place and we need more time, then my views might be a little different. However, considering that the work is already substantially progressed, that's really encouraging and I haven't yet been convinced as to why we couldn't shorten the sunset clause here in recognition of that work needing to happen, because we have had these laws now for 20 years and there hasn't been a review in Tasmania. It would be a sign from the parliament that we want that review work to continue rapidly and for the parliament to be able to consider any legislative changes in the second-half of next year, which the Attorney-General has already mentioned is his anticipated timeframe.

Mr BARNETT - Chair, if nobody else is responding, we have an amendment before us which is supporting a three-year sunset clause and it seems that my Labor opposition counterpart is looking at that favourably. I want to express to this Chamber in the strongest possible terms the strongest possible opposition to the amendment before us, and make it very clear that if this amendment were to be agreed, in three years time it is possible that we wouldn't have anti-terrorism legislation in this state. That is a concern I have on behalf of the government.

We have put forward a 10-year recommendation in this bill. It's been thought through carefully and is consistent with other jurisdictions. If you have one piece of the puzzle missing when it comes to terrorism, that's exactly what will happen if we're not prepared as a state and as a nation. We've seen it in recent times with the anti-Semitic objectives of the Iranian government in Melbourne bombing synagogues, and we've come out of 9-11, we've come out of the 2002 Bali bombings, and for good reason. We put these legislations in place across this nation at a federal level for 10 years, in 2005 for 10 years, in 2015 for another 10 years, and that's exactly what we're doing. These laws haven't been used in this state. We're rolling it over for another 10 years. 

You make reference to the review which I've mentioned consistently through my remarks. That review is for the purposes of improving the legislation. There's nobody who would countenance throwing it out the door altogether. Nobody's countenancing that, but that's exactly the effect of the legislation and the amendment that's been put forward by the Greens. Let me make it very clear that we are protecting community safety. That's what this government's about. 

I am concerned this is inconsistent with other jurisdictions and inconsistent with what's happening at the federal level. We are acting consistently across the nation to combat terrorism and we won't have a bar of anything less than full support for community safety in the protection of the public.

Ms Haddad - It's really disingenuous of you to suggest that it's anything other than that in this place today, Attorney-General, and you know it.

Mr BARNETT - I've made it clear that 10 years is what we support and I've said that all the way through the debate. We now have an amendment for three years. We won't have a bar of it; we'll be voting against it. 

Dr WOODRUFF - Minister, I've seen you get grumpy before when you don't get your way with legislation and things get amended that you haven't agreed to, but I have not yet seen you stoop to attacking us for asking reasonable questions. You've yet to dignify Ms Haddad with a response, and I have the same questions.

What exactly is wrong with three years? It's keeping everything as it is. It's not not passing the legislation. That is a completely rubbish argument. Surely, you know that. If you don't, I'm embarrassed for you. It's not true, and it's not okay for you to come in and make stuff up because you feel threatened that we want to make an amendment, that you haven't yet mounted a single argument for why our amendment is unreasonable. All we're doing is saying, you're the person who's saying it's going to be done and dusted by the end of next year. Well, great. We're giving you another two years on top of that, for the avoidance of any doubt, and it is not inconsistent with what's happening in other parts of the country. That is also not true because, as I outlined, other states will have their reviews done by the end of this year, by the end of next year, by the end of 2027.

All we're talking about is getting the review done by the end of 2028 and maybe not making any changes to the laws because they're fine or maybe strengthening them, or whatever. It's about a proper assessment and holding the government to account. If you say a year, well, we'll give you three, but we collectively expect you to do it and you're just expecting us to take your word, and I'm sorry, we want it in writing.

Ms HADDAD - Deputy Chair, through you, I'm a little bit offended by the implications of the Attorney-General in his contribution. I asked a good faith question, understanding that he told me and the House that the work is already happening in his department and at a national level through the inter-jurisdictional counter-terrorism working group. I asked a genuine question, why is 3 years not enough? I haven't put forward the amendment. I'm considering the amendment on behalf of the opposition.

If the work is already underway, I genuinely want to know, hand on heart, why three years is not enough. The answer the Attorney-General gave me is that Labor and the Greens offer a threat to community safety, that we wouldn't have counter-terrorism laws and that this is some underhanded threat upon the legislation and the regime that we have, which is a really dishonest way to present an argument when you've just heard every speaker in this place explain their understanding, including my own, of the need for laws to address the threat of terrorism. While those laws were seen as extraordinary when they were considered in 2005, everyone knows they're now part of our legislative make-up. They're part of the reality of dealing with legislating in modern-day Australia and around the world.

No one is arguing against that. No one is saying we should 'throw them out,' which I believe are the words the Attorney-General used, or that we shouldn't have counterterrorism laws or anti-terrorism laws. Nobody is arguing that, least of all me.

It is concerning to see that explosive response from the Attorney-General just now which indicates his intent, possibly, to go down a very ugly path with this, to make some suggestion that the opposition and crossbench are not committed to counterterrorism laws, which, of course, we absolutely are.

There is a number of options for government here. One of them is to not have legislation with sunset clauses and to make permanent legislation a priority. That could be something that the review recommends. That is possible.

I haven't been convinced by the Attorney-General yet as to why 10 years is needed. If it's work that's underway right now, why is three years not enough? I note Prof Razay foreshadowed in his contribution that he also has a proposed amendment, which has a five-year sunset clause. Why is five years not enough? We all want that review to take place. We all want robust laws on our statute books that keep Tasmanians safe, that keep us free from the threats of terrorism that might affect us and our fellow Tasmanians. No one is arguing against that.

I am really disappointed in the response. I feel that the debate on this bill, until this amendment debate, has been very respectful and understanding of the fact that the parliament does need these laws. However, I have not yet been convinced by you Attorney-General, I'm sorry, as to why 10 years is required for a sunset clause, other than it's what we had before. I can tell you from my personal experience in 2005, part of the national debate is that 10 year sunset clauses are generally considered very long in Australian parliaments. Sunset clauses that I've seen in bills since I've been in this place are usually between one and five years.

I want Tasmania to have the best anti-terrorism laws, on the books that we can, that keep Tasmanians safe, and that cooperate and work in a national context with the laws of our state and territorial counterparts on the mainland. Everybody wants that. I'm not arguing against that, but, I haven't yet been convinced as to why, other than the Attorney-General wants to make some unfair and baseless claim that this is about not having anti-terrorism laws. I want to make it really clear on the record right now, that if that's what the government intends to do, or if that's how it's intended to be reported in the media, that that is false. That is not true and it is not the view of the Tasmanian Labor Party.

Dr WOODRUFF - Deputy Chair, I want to add to that. If the government would be preparing some sort of media release that would falsely claim that we don't support these laws, then that would be false. It's completely counter to the way we talked about behaving in this parliament. When we formed this 52nd Parliament, collectively, we talked about representing the views of what we do in here in good faith and working in good faith. It doesn't mean you can't have robust debates, as we're doing now. To just turn on 'attack' is unnecessary. Just answer the question.

Mr BARNETT - Through you, Deputy Chair, to be very clear, as I indicated already, under the amendment that has been put, if it was passed by this Chamber, these laws would expire in three years time. They would expire. That's the effect of the amendment.

Dr Woodruff - They're going to expire in 10 years time under your law.

Ms Haddad - They will actually expire this year, if the bill is not passed right now.

DEPUTY CHAIR - Thank you, member for Clark.

Mr BARNETT - Deputy Chair, the purpose of the review is to improve the laws, based on an analysis of other jurisdictions and their feedback. The purpose of the review is not to up-end them altogether and throw them out the window. The purpose is to improve the laws. Let me make that very clear. If you were thinking that the review is for the purposes of doing away with the laws altogether, that is not the purpose from the government's perspective, of the review. If they can be improved in some way, then that's what we would like to achieve in that review. We will get the feedback, we will engage with the public, express the view accordingly, and then bring all that forward into the parliament and progress accordingly.

The effect of this amendment, if it were to be passed, would put Tasmania out of step with the rest of the country. The 10 years is consistent with the 10 years before it and the 10 years before that from 2005. It was a 10-year extension and then a further 10-year extension. That's exactly what we're doing. If you're not sure - through you, Deputy Chair, to my shadow Labor minister - talk to your federal colleagues in Canberra. It's consistent with the views expressed out of Canberra. It's consistent with most of the jurisdictions. Yes, some of them are still having reviews, but there's no intention of a sunset clause in those various jurisdictions, very, very soon. In fact, most of them are consistent with where Tasmania is at. Tasmania is trying to be consistent - because as I mentioned earlier, the piece of the puzzle - if you build one piece out, terrorism is a very real possibility in this country, and it's increased from possible to probable based on ASIO's assessment. It's on the public record, this is a concern.

I talked about the firebombing, orchestrated by the Iranian government of Israeli interests in Melbourne, in recent times, and that's a very good example. It has been used in other jurisdictions, it hasn't been used in Tasmania. I want to make that very clear. The position of our government is very clear. If this amendment were to be supported, it would expire in three-years' time, not in 10-years' time, and it's something we just don't support.

Mr GEORGE - Deputy Chair, I wasn't going to engage in this debate. The Attorney-General and I have had several conversations and briefings, and up until now they've been rational. Unfortunately, he's departed from that. I take offence at the suggestion that because someone wants to change the timing of a sunset clause, they apparently are enabling or supporting the potential for terrorism in Tasmania. 

I'm not sure when Tasmania decided that it had to follow the rest of Australia. Generally, Tasmania and this Tasmanian parliament make up its own mind. There is nothing wrong with changing a sunset clause. The point is that in three-years' time, five-years' time, 10-years' time, this legislation may not be tough enough, or we might find it's too tough, or we find that it's not working, or we find it's working fine. If it's working fine in five-years' time or in three-years' time, it will sail through the House again.

The fact that a sunset clause is imposed, that doesn't suit the government - I hate to mention the fact that it's a minority government and therefore has to collaborate with not only the opposition from time to time, as I've noticed you have today, but also you have to collaborate with the crossbench. Three years and five years or 10 years is just a number. It doesn't affect the legislation at all, and it certainly does not imply that anyone on the crossbench, anyone in the opposition, or indeed anyone on the government benches may be a supporter of terrorism or may be leaving the window open for Tasmania to become a target of terrorist.

I support the idea of not imposing a 10-year sunset clause but something more rational and shorter.

Ms HADDAD - Deputy Chair, I will reflect again on what the Attorney-General said, that these laws would expire in three years if this amendment is passed. He's quite right. However, if this bill doesn't pass - which is not a threat, it's just a statement of fact - the laws would expire this year. That's how sunset clauses work. Right now, it's going expire at the end of 2025. If this amendment passes, it'll expire at the end of 2028. If Prof Razay's amendment for five years passes, it will expire at the end of 2030. If the government's bill passes unamended, it will expire at the end of 2035.

I want to make it really clear, very calmly here right now, that these laws are necessary, that the review is necessary, and strengthening of the laws if required is necessary. The Attorney-General has already said that he intends to complete the review and legislate by the end of 2026. Nobody is talking about removing these laws. No one is talking about that. Not you with your bill, because they will expire. By your own logic, they will expire because there's a sunset clause in the bill, and that's how sunset clauses work. Therefore, they're either going to expire at the end of this year, at the end of 2035 or the end of 2030 or the end of 2038, and be extended.

As I said on the last contribution I made on this amendment, if the review work isn't complete - which can happen, I've worked in the bureaucracy, I know that things can sometimes take longer than anticipated - the government will have time to come back with another amending bill with a new sunset clause. No government is just going to let these laws expire either at the end of this year, clearly, because we're here debating this bill right now, or at the end of three, five or ten years. Any government of any persuasion will act at that time. No matter when a sunset clause expires, any government will act. I still haven't had an argument from the Attorney-General that has convinced me about why 10 is the number, other than it was 10 before. 

I would like to have the opportunity to debate Prof Razay's amendment as well. I'm not sure if it's his intention still to move it, but it might be a nice middle ground for the government to consider since there is concern in the parliament that's been raised today and should be considered. Not in a disingenuous base political way of suggesting that anyone in this place doesn't think that we need laws to address terrorism. That's not the case. 

Ms JOHNSTON - Deputy Chair, I agree with the contributions made by my colleagues, particularly on the crossbench and the honourable Ella Haddad. I pose a question to the Attorney-General: should the review conclude towards the end of next year and find that there needs to be a strengthening of our terrorism laws, or there be an interjurisdictional move to strengthen them, would the Attorney-General wait for the 10 years for the current bill to expire or the current act to expire, or would you act earlier? This merely provides a timely opportunity for the parliament to consider any changes that might need to be made to this particular piece of legislation to ensure that it's contemporary. I cannot for the life of me understand why you would not take that opportunity. I do, as others have in this place, object to the insinuation that we are somehow soft on terrorism or would allow Tasmania to become a safe haven for terrorists. That's not the intent at all of anyone raising this particular concern.

In fact, I think there is wholehearted agreement that we wanted the most robust, strong anti-terrorism laws here in the state. We want to make sure that it's reviewed properly and there's an opportunity for this parliament to strengthen those and to make sure that what we are doing is correct, is following contemporary laws. 

I object to the insinuations that have been made by the Attorney-General, and ask the question, simply: if the review finds that there needs to be strengthening of those particular laws or major changes, would you wait the 10 years for the act to expire, or would you act earlier? If you would act earlier, then why on earth can't it be three years for the expiry of this particular bill?

Dr WOODRUFF - Deputy Chair, what I hope will be my final word is - minister, you said before that we would be introducing this sunset clause for three years. I want to put it really clearly on the record: you introduced the sunset clause. You've put a sunset clause in this bill. It's got a sunset clause. It's your sunset clause. We're not introducing a sunset clause. We're amending the date of the sunset clause, and you have still not yet provided any response or any argument for why, when you've said your review's going to be done at the end of next year, why three years isn't an abundantly long time. Even if it wasn't done, you are the government: you could still come in, as we would expect you to, and provide another amendment to the sunset clause for another period of time to get the work done. You're the government. You've got all that time, and if you're actually saying that you don't think you can get it done in three years, maybe just be honest with us that that's actually what you think is likely, because we've heard from you and staff that next year is what you're talking about. That seems fair and reasonable. That's why we provided an extra two years. We all want Tasmania to be safe, and I think this amendment will allow that.

Mr BARNETT - Deputy Chair, some concluding remarks to make a couple of points. To make it clear and on the record, of course, I concur with the remarks of those in the Chamber that have been aired today in terms of our concerns for community safety. I want to put that on the record. I acknowledge that. I think the good intentions throughout the Chamber are acknowledged. I want to make that very clear as well.

However, I also make the point that here we are at the eleventh hour of the 10 years, which expires on 31 December this year, and that's because - so I'm just making the first point. I'm making the point that, timeframe-wise, this is tight. We have to get these laws passed this year. That's because we've had an election in the middle of this year; otherwise it would have happened sooner. I would be concerned going into a future period where you've got legislation where this bill expires - finito - in three years' time. I don't know what would be happening at that time in that last year if there were to be an election, if caretaker kicked in. I'm just raising that point and that's another reason. I've made it clear that our legislation is consistent with most of the other jurisdictions, including the Commonwealth - it is 10 years. 

As to the review that I've outlined, we will take feedback from other jurisdictions which are having reviews at the moment and including next year. I'd like to think we could get the feedback from those jurisdictions and learn from those jurisdictions where they have implemented their laws. That will take time and it's for the purposes of improving the legislation. It's not for the purposes of pulling on another sunset clause or throwing the legislation out altogether. 

I think I've been considerate, thoughtful, and have responded to the views that have been put. Ten years is a very strong argument and we certainly don't support the amendment for three years and we commend that view to members in this Chamber. 

DEPUTY CHAIR (Mr Mitchell) - The question is that the amendment be agreed to.

Amendment negatived.

Prof RAZAY - Deputy Chair, I move the following amendment to clause 4 - 

Page 4, clause 4.

Leave out '2035'. 

Insert instead '2030'.

What a lovely debate we had, so passionate. It created so much connectedness between us all. I learned so much from this debate. We all agree, we are all supporting the Terrorism (Preventative Detention) Act 2005. We all argue about the duration. I have looked at other states: the Commonwealth has extended the terrorism legislation for three years; the ACT extended it for six years; Western Australia three years; Queensland to 2031; Victoria to 2031; New South Wales expires at the end of next year, and the preventative detention act authorised the police for another three years; and South Australia had it for 10 years.

After listening to all contributions from our honourable members, perhaps we have to reach a compromise? How about we go to the middle? That's why I propose five years and that means leaving out the clause to 2035 and insert 2030.

Mr BARNETT - Deputy Chair. I acknowledge Prof Razay's contribution. I thank him for his remarks in terms of the goodwill across the Chamber, which I concur with, the collaboration. The views which have been expressed, which differ and we could agree to disagree. In this case, the government disagrees with Prof Razay's amendment. We won't be supporting the amendment, for the reasons that I've outlined earlier in terms of support for 10 years.

Noting the concerns about the pieces of the puzzle, and if one's missing, then yes, terrorism can take place. We want there to be consistency across the nation, across jurisdictions and across the country. I appreciate where you're coming from, Prof Razay, and the views across this Chamber, but, as a government, we won't support that amendment, for the reasons that I've outlined earlier in the debate.

SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS

Third Reading Forthwith

SITTING TIMES

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Treasurer) - Deputy Speaker, I move -

Pursuant to Sessional Order 18A that, for this day's sitting, the House not stand adjourned at 6.00 p.m. and that the House continue to sit past 6.00 p.m.

The purpose for that is simply so that we can deal with the next bill that is on the Notice Paper. Hopefully, we won't be needing it, but just in case. The idea is that we try to deal with bills as they come up so we don't have a huge logjam at the end of the sittings.

Motion agreed to.


COMMISSION FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE BILL 2025 (No. 54)

Second Reading

[4.58 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice, Corrections and Rehabilitation) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the bill be now read the second time.

The government is committed to implementing all 191 recommendations made by the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings. A critical reform was the recommendation to establish a commission for children and young people. The Commission for Children and Young People Bill 2025 fulfils this commitment. It will create three new statutory roles in the new commission, a Commissioner for Children and Young People, a Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People, and a Child Advocate. The existing Independent Regulator who overseas Tasmanian organisations to comply with the Child and Youth Safe Organisations framework will be part of the commission.

The bill is the product of a whole-of-government approach with extensive community consultation. The departments of Premier and Cabinet; Justice; and Education, Children and Young People work closely together. The Commissioner for Children and Young People and the Independent Regulator were closely consulted throughout drafting. The government undertook extensive public consultation on a draft bill for three months from September 2024. The final bill has been amended and improved significantly from the consultation draft. There were 14 targeted consultation sessions with key stakeholder groups, including children and young people, Aboriginal organisations and people, victim-survivors, and foster and kinship carers, including Tasmanian government agencies. We also received 31 written submissions. Submissions and a 'what we heard' report on face-to-face consultations were published in April this year.

The feedback received was detailed and constructive. I thank all stakeholders who contributed to this important process. There was overwhelming support for an enhanced Commission for Children and Young People.

How the commission will operate. It is important to be clear on what the new commission will be expected and empowered to do. As the COI noted, the new commission will not be a general complaints handling or investigative body. However, the COI also considered that, after a transition period, the same person would fill the roles of both the Commissioner for Children and Young People and the Independent Regulator. This would embed the investigative functions of the independent regulator under the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Act 2023 within the commission. The COI wrote that:

As the successor to the current Commissioner for Children and Young People, the new Commission will have the benefit of being known to Tasmanian children and families as an organisation that can help with concerns relating to children and young people. It will ensure there is one oversight body in Tasmania with a focus on their safety and wellbeing. [tbc]

The COI considered this to take account of Tasmania's relatively small size and the need for regulation to be effective and efficient.

I will first walk through how the commission will work. The new Commissioner for Children and Young People will be the head of agency for the purposes of administration of the commission as a State Service agency, and will be the first of the three new commissioners appointed. As a State Service agency, the commission will be able to manage its staff and finances directly, rather than through a department.

Ultimately, one person will be appointed as both Commissioner for Children and Young People under the bill and independent regulator under the Child and Youth Safe Organisations act. This will follow a transition period during which two different people hold those roles. The transition period is expected to be up to three years after the commencement of the act, as the current independent regulator's term of appointment expires on 24 January 2029.

The Independent Regulator's functions and powers remain in the Child and Youth Safe Organisation Act. The Commissioner for Children and Young People, Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People, and the Child Advocate will have both specific functions and powers relevant to their office and shared general powers of the commission.

The bill sets out several principles to be applied when a person is performing a function or exercising a power under the bill. The paramount consideration is the welfare and best interests of children and young people.

As a result of consultation, the final bill expressly states that this paramount consideration is reflected in, but is not limited to, the rights and principles specified in the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child, Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It also states that relevant provisions of those documents are to be taken into account when performing a function or exercising a power.

The commission's general functions will include making recommendations to government on system improvements, to conduct inquiries into systemic issues, and advocacy for all, or a class of, children and young people. Further, it will promote the safety and wellbeing, rights and participation and care and treatment of children and young people in out-of-home care or the Youth Justice system.

The Child Advocate and Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People have exclusive powers and functions regarding advocacy for an individual child or young person. The bill will require the Child Advocate to establish and administer an independent visitor scheme regarding children and young people in detention and out-of-home care. The Child Advocate may consult with the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People about how that applies to Aboriginal children and Aboriginal young people. Both of those commissioners will be empowered to appoint independent visitors. Each of the three commissioners is taken to be an independent visitor under the scheme. The bill creates those powers but does not establish the scheme itself.

The COI scheduled date for completion for the scheme is July 2029. The bill does not contain coercive powers of entry to residences or premises regarding the out-of-home care system. I anticipate that the Independent Visitor Scheme, when established, will include strong but measured considered powers regarding access to an oversight of children and young people in out-of-home care. I also expect that this will occur with appropriate community consultation and input from the commission.

The child advocate has further functions and powers which include helping a child or young person, in appropriate circumstances, to make a complaint or even to make that complaint as proxy to a statutory complaints authority. That means a person or entity, including an agency, with a legislated function or power to determine complaints or review decisions. This is an expansion of a COI recommendation about assisting with complaints to the Ombudsman.

The Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People has similar functions and powers as the Child Advocate in respect of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person is to be appointed to this commissioner's position.

In terms of the powers. The commission's general powers include requiring information and data for the purposes of maintaining information about Tasmanian children and identifying and monitoring trends relating to them.

It has systemic investigation inquiry and review powers. It does not inquire into specific decisions, complaints, or circumstances regarding an individual, child or young person. However, it can investigate or review a systemic matter that arises as a result of a matter raised about an individual. It can also hold an inquiry into a matter raised in respect of an individual, if that is commenced by the Child Advocate or Commission of Aboriginal Children and Young People. These mechanisms allow the commission to examine services and provide recommendations to government through reports tabled in parliament.

The bill gives the commission power to access, inspect and review a detention facility without warrant. This is not intended to match the extent of the powers of the Custodial Inspector or national preventive mechanism, because the commission is essentially an advisory and reporting body.

There is ongoing work to consider the different approaches recommended by the COI and former Ombudsman, Mr Connick, in relation to the powers of the Custodial Inspector and the national preventive mechanism regarding children and young people.

The relevant COI recommendations in this area are 12.38 and 12.39 and will progress by 1 July 2026 as scheduled. They are not expected to require amendments to this bill, but amendments to the Custodial Inspector and National Preventive Mechanism Legislation may be required.

The bill's inspection powers allow general access during the ordinary business hours of a detention facility or as agreed between the commissioner and person in charge of the facility. They can occur with or without notice.

There is power to take photographs, files or audio or visual recordings. It is an offence for a person in charge of a detention facility to unreasonably refuse a commissioner access.

However, the commissioner has access to a resident child, young person or person with care or charge of a child in a detention facility at any time to monitor the safety and wellbeing of the resident.

A person in charge of a detention facility, a member of staff, or a person providing services at the detention facility commits an offence if they do not allow a commissioner to interview a resident in private or allow an interpreter to accompany the commissioner for that purpose.

Written communications between the resident and the commissioner are also protected.

Important definitions. The bill contains definitions that have been significantly strengthened since the consultation draft. A child is a person under the age of 18.

The term 'young person' covers people aged 15 through 20 inclusive, who still have or have had experience in the youth justice or out-of-home care systems.

Out-of-home care is also defined to cover a range of orders or statutory powers under the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1997 and some under the Adoption Act 1988. This gives certainty to the commission's jurisdiction.

There is a collection of definitions regarding detention.

'Detention facility' has a broad definition to cover detention centres, prisons holding children and young people, various police facilities including stations, vehicles and watch houses and courts. This covers people on remand or people under sentence. Other terms 'facility resident' and 'resident' round this out to cover someone with a child of their own in detention there because of that parent's circumstances.

The bill applies to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in two different ways. Children and young people need only self-identify, or to be recognised as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people, to access the assistance of the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People. Such children would mostly self-identify while the commissioner can also support very young children or children with communication needs who can't self-identify but who are recognised as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children - for instance, this may be the recognition of a parent or relative or persons in the community.

The bill also defines the phrase 'a person known to be an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander'. This definition applies to the appointment of adults to positions created by the bill. These include the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People an Independent Visitor appointed to visit Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, and the majority of selection panel members appointing the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People. These persons must be of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, identify as such, and be accepted as such by a recognised Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisation. This reflects the definition and test as recently passed by parliament in the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Act 1923.

The bill also makes clear that using the word Aboriginal in reference to a child or young person is taken to include a reference to Torres State Islander too. Each commissioner in the new commission, when providing services to children, will be bound by the Child and Youth Safe Standards and the universal principle in the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Act.

That means the commission must provide an environment that respects the right to cultural safety of children who identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. Appointment requirements for commissioners reflect the COI recommendations. These include a transparent process, compliance with best practice for merit-based recruitment and a selection panel with at least one non-government employee and, if appropriate, at least one young person.

A panel of children and young people must also be consulted for its views and opinions regarding selection of the commissioner and determining the best process for selection. The selection process for the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People also requires the majority of the selection panel to be known to be Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.

Finally, before making a recommendation to the Governor regarding appointing a commissioner, the minister is to consult with at least one representative of each political party that then has two or more sitting members of parliament.

The bill's information management provisions were significantly redrafted after consultation to clarify and improve them. The bill requires the commission to protect the identity of a child or young person as far as is practicable. There is express guidance on commissioners sharing information within the commission to ensure information privacy. The commission may request information from persons and specific bodies. 

When necessary, the commission can also compel the provision of information, a group of government and statutory bodies who have their own information-management powers and responsibilities defined as relevant authorities are not subject to this power. An example is the Integrity commission. There are further safeguards which the commission must consider before compelling identifying information.

It is an offence not to comply with the requirement to provide information unless a listed exemption applies. The Magistrates Court may make an order requiring compliance with the commission's requirement. The bill provides for the commission's ability to disclose or refer information under specified criteria and for confidentiality of information obtained under the bill. The bill improves upon the consultation version by using a more targeted exemption to the Personal Information Protection Act 2004 which maintains personal information protection obligations where possible.

By consequential amendment to the Right to Information Act 2009, the bill adds the commission and each commissioner as excluded persons or bodies, so that act only applies to information about the commission's administration. This is consistent with the current Commissioner for Children and Young People.

Timeframe to establish the commission: the COI acknowledged it would take some time to fully establish the new commission. The COI provided a timeframe of 1 July 2024. However, work on the bill found that this timeframe did not allow for the significance and complexity of this reform. Consistent with the COIs recommendations and timelines, the full implementation of the bill will take place in phases.

The first phase on commencement of the bill is the establishment of the commission and appointment of the new Commissioner for Children and Young People. The second phase includes appointing the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People and the Child Advocate. These appointments are due by July 2026. Establishing the Independent Visitor Scheme is due by July 2029.

As I've mentioned, one person will ultimately be appointed as both the Commissioner for Children and Young People and the independent regulator. The bill manages these steps by being drafted in a way that allows the relevant sections to be commenced by proclamation of the Governor at later dates.

Independence: the bill has multiple provisions designed to ensure the independence of the commission and each commissioner. Each may perform the functions and exercise the powers of the commission. If one commissioner performs a function or exercises a power, this does not stop another commissioner or the commission from performing that function or exercising that power.

The commissioner is not subject to the direction or control of the minister or any minister. The commission and each commissioner must act independently, impartially and in the public interest. When doing so, a commissioner is not subject to the direction or control of any other commissioner nor to the State Service Act 2000 in respect to that statutory function or power.

As the minister administering the bill, I have a power to request that the commission conduct an inquiry, which can include an inquiry outside the commission's usual jurisdiction. This reflects the power regarding investigations or reviews under the current act. However, the bill gives the commission discretion to refuse this request, preserving its independence.

Oversight: the bill also has appropriate oversight mechanisms. If the commission is satisfied that the function or power is unable to be performed or exercised by a specific commissioner without a conflict of interest being present, the commission may authorise another commissioner, if appropriate, to perform that function or exercise that power.

Provisions regarding the commission's administration cover annual reporting requirements. These include summaries of any inquiries, a list of published reports and a forward-looking annual plan describing the proposed program of work and activities as known for that financial year.

This must be tabled in each house of parliament. There is discretion too, at any time, to table other relevant reports in each house of parliament, or provide them to the minister or joint committee, or to publish reports.

The bill creates a new joint standing committee on the Commission for Children and Young People. This is based on the Integrity Commission Act 2009 and its joint standing committee on integrity. This new commission is so different in purpose and function with its child-centred focus that it justifies a new committee being established.

The bill preserves the Children and Young People Advisory Council and Children and Young People Consultative Council, created under the existing Commissioner for Children and Young People Act 2016. The Child Advocate must establish an advisory group in relation to children in out-of-home care. The Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People must establish an advisory group in relation to Aboriginal children and young people. There are broad discretionary powers to establish other committees or advisory groups, to determine their terms of reference, and to consult with the committee or advisory group in respect to the proposed terms of reference.

The Joint Standing Committee is to review the functions, powers and operations of the commission and each commissioner and to table its report as soon as practicable after the third anniversary of the commencement of the relevant provision.

Second, a statutory review is to occur in respect to the five-year period commencing on the first appointment of a commissioner under the act. The bill requires the commission to liaise with other relevant statutory authorities, statutory officers and official bodies when conducting an inquiry or investigation. One purpose of this is to prevent, if appropriate, duplicate inquiries or investigations. 

Another purpose is to facilitate the coordination and resourcing of inquiries or investigations into matters that are to be conducted separately. Hence, concurrent matters are not entirely ruled out.

The same provision also requires the commission to take certain actions if it becomes aware that a child or young person has sought assistance from another of its counterparts in that cohort. It must take all reasonable steps to avoid unnecessary duplication of assistance while facilitating the provision of support and assistance in respect to that matter.

There are general offence provisions around protection from reprisals for persons providing information to the commission, and protection from liability for those acting in good faith. The bill effectively combines four different statutory officers into one new commission. It is the product of sustained effort to honour the COI recommendations and improve on a consultation version, thanks to the detailed input of many and varied stakeholders.

I thank everyone who has contributed to this bill - a tremendous step forward in the shared purpose of this government, this parliament, and the community at large, to make Tasmanian children safer. I commend the bill to the House.

[5.21 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important bill. I will start where the Attorney-General finished his contribution. This is historic and landmark legislation. It was one of the key recommendations of the commission of inquiry that a new statutory office be established, and I remember at the time that the Office of the Independent Regulator was being established we as an opposition did express some concern at that time. Not because we were in any kind of disagreement about the need for that role, but because of the very compelling evidence that the commission did hear about the disjointed and fragmented nature of our oversight systems in Tasmania, which, in the very worst examples, didn't cause but allowed things to go unnoticed and unchecked, and people were not held to account for the kind of heinous and awful crimes of the very worst nature, sexual crimes against young people in particular. 

I also want to put on the record today, as I have at other debates in this place, my gratitude and admiration to everybody who gave their stories to the commission. How important it was that people were able to do that. How compelling those stories were but also recognise how painful it would have been for many of those individuals, as well as their families and loved ones and advocates, to retell those stories, to reshare those traumas. The value of them having done that is profound, absolutely profound, in reshaping our systems of administration and oversight to keep young people safe, and, without their generosity and their bravery to share their stories with the commission, we may not have had the kind of wide sweeping recommendations that the commission was able to make. It's profoundly important that we respect those people who did that, shared their stories to make Tasmania a safer place for children into the future. 

But, likewise, I also commend everybody that worked on the commission, the commissioners themselves, the staff, the people within government who worked on it and have been working on the implementation since. It is a heavy burden of work that the commission and parliament have quite rightly directed, but it doesn't go unnoticed that it is tough work. It's tough work for the people who are doing it, but they're doing it for the right reasons. They are improving Tasmanian systems of governance and they are making an incredible difference to the safety of Tasmanian children into the future, and they should be thanked and commended for doing so.

The commission, as I said, did identify systemic failures. In their final report of 2023, and I will quote, they found 'profound and widespread failings.' They described the system as fragmented and disjointed and at worst completely dysfunctional. They recommended the need for stronger advocacy, recognising that at the time the Commissioner for Children and Young People's powers were not enough to satisfy what the commission saw as the need for young people to be able to be kept safe. They said that the powers under the previous act, lacked the necessary independence, powers and functions and resources to effectively advocate for children's rights and monitor child-safe practises.

They, of course, also made a key recommendation to abolish that former role and its enabling legislation and create a new commission, which is what the bill before us today does.

I want to reflect on the long road that has led to this important legislation and pause to recognise that it is very important that the government has acted on this really relatively swiftly in terms of the wheels of bureaucracy and parliament and an election in the meantime - it's commendable that this is being progressed today.

As we heard, the purpose of the bill is to establish that new commission, the Commission for Children and Young People. It will abolish the old role and establish three new roles: the Commissioner for Children and Young People; the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People; and the Child Advocate. Importantly, they will all sit together in one organisation, all under the leadership of the new role of the Commissioner for Children and Young People.

I mentioned the Independent Regulator before and I also want to commend Ms Coe, who is currently in that role, and the people working in her team for the important work that they are doing right now in overseeing child safety at the moment.

My understanding is that that role will sit within the new commission for a period of time and then eventually will be fused with that head role, the Commissioner for Children and Young People will also hold the functions of the independent regulator. I think I said 'monitor' before: I'm sorry, there's so many roles, which is kind of the point. I should have said the 'independent regulator' earlier as well.

The bill provides the functions and powers of this new commission, which will include advocating, upholding and promoting the rights of children and young people and monitoring the operation of the out-of-home care and youth justice systems. All three of those new commissioners, once appointed, will be able to perform the functions and use the powers provided under this bill. Individual commissioners will also have specific functions relating to their roles.

I recognise the widespread community consultation that was conducted on this bill. It's a very important component of legislative development that people affected by legislation are consulted and able to give their views. Ordinarily, I would read a lot of those into the Hansard. I've chosen not to do that today because I recognise that there have been substantial changes to this bill as a result of that community consultation, in the briefing, which I should put on the record- my thanks to the minister and his office for organising a briefing for me with his departmental officers who have worked on this massive piece of law reform. But I understand from the briefing that the version of the bill that went out for community consultation was, I think, version number 8, and this is version number 22. That's significant change.

For that reason, I am not going to read a lot of the concerns that were raised by those submitters, which are ordinarily always do in this place. But I did want to explain my reasoning behind that because I do recognise that not everything that was raised in that community consultation was addressed, and there might be some further legislative reform for some of those bigger issues that were put on the record by some of those community consultation submissions. I did want to put on the record my thanks to the people who did do that work of providing feedback to the government on the bill, likewise, with the work that was done in the commission, without practical suggestions from Community organisations and from individuals who are affected by the laws that we make in this place, we're unable to make the best laws that we can.

I want to put on the record my thanks to the people who did provide very robust and important feedback to the government, much of which I understand, has been adopted in this bill, but not all. Some of the things that have been done as a result of that community consultation include strengthening the role of the relevant United Nations conventions and naming them up in the in the bill itself, as well as clarifying that the commission undertakes systemic reviews rather than individual complaint handling functions, but also reiterating the fact that they do have advocacy functions, which of course can be informed by individual cases.

There was also a lot of redrafting in the definitions and the key terms parts of the bill, as well as providing whistleblower protection for people providing information to the new commission. The bill sets up a systemic oversight role for the new Commissioner for Children and Young People. The functions will generally include advice and recommendations to ministers and organisations, investigating and influencing policy development of government, conducting inquiries into systemic matters, advocating for children, promoting the wellbeing of children, empowering and upholding the rights of children, monitoring the care of children in out of home care and youth justice as well as other functions as well.

When I was talking about the independent regulator, not monitor, I'm sorry for that, once that role is fused with the commissioner role, those two statutory officers will be held in one position, the Commissioner for Children and Young People. Holding these two officers will expand that commissioner's role to include oversight of the Child Youth Safe Organisations framework, as well as compliance with the child Standards and enforcing the reportable conduct scheme. All of those functions will come into one organisation.

Importantly, the commission recommended two other statutory officer roles to sit within this same organisation, which the government has addressed in this bill, and that is the appointment of a Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and young people, and a child advocate for those positions are created by this legislation.

The Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People will be an independent commissioner who advocates for Aboriginal children and young people. The bill provides that that person who is appointed to that position will be a Tasmanian Aboriginal person.

Their functions and powers will include monitoring and investigating the experiences and treatment of Aboriginal children and young people in out of home care and youth detention, promoting the safety and wellbeing of Aboriginal children and Aboriginal young people, and assisting Aboriginal children and young people to make complaints to statutory complaint authorities such as the Ombudsman. I want to reflect on the very deep importance of this role.

There is an over representation of Tasmanian Aboriginal young people in our out of home care system and in our youth justice system, as well as an over representation of Tasmanian Aboriginal people in adult justice system. It's the responsibility of all of us as policy makers and legislators to do the things that are necessary to address that inequity and to address the kind of systemic issues that lead to that over representation. 

The fact that there will be a specific role advocating for the rights of Aboriginal children and young people is in itself very important and sends a very important message to the community about the value that the parliament places on the safety of Aboriginal children and young people, but the fact that they will also have an oversight role in how Aboriginal young people are experiencing the out of home care system or the youth detention system is also very important.

The fact that the new commission will have the power to assist Aboriginal young people to make complaints to other statutory complaint authorities is very important because one of the key things that led to this recommendation from the commissioners was the fragmented nature of our current systems. The fact that there are often complaint-handling avenues for Tasmanians to access, but they don't know about them, or they don't know the right one to go to. I remember it was reported quite widely in the media a day when the commission heard from a range of statutory officers and, without being flippant about the evidence that they gave, it was very clear to the commissioners, the media and anyone else observing that day that there was a real risk of people slipping through the cracks. Each of those statutory officers gave examples of particular cases that didn't fit within their jurisdiction. They had very cogent arguments about each case, and they weren't wrong to understand and exercise their powers within their own jurisdiction. What became clear, however, was that the end result was young people slipping through the cracks.

All the more reason for this commission to be set up and set up swiftly. It will mean there is less fragmentation across our system, while recognising that there are other statutory officers that may have a role to play or that people might want to access - the Ombudsman, as the Attorney-General named, but also the Anti-Discrimination, and the Health Complaints Commissioners. There is a range of other statutory officers who will continue to exist and continue to be able to look at complaints within their own jurisdictions, but the fact that this commission will be able to help young people to do that is compelling. That was a very roundabout way of me saying that that's a good part of this bill.

Finally, the third statutory officer created under this bill is the Child Advocate who will be another independent commissioner who will administer an independent community visitor scheme and a permanent advisory group relating to out-of-home care. The Child Advocate will advocate for children and young people, inquire into youth justice services or out-of-home care services if a concern has been raised about the provision of those services, as well as assist and support young people and children to make complaints in the same way that the Aboriginal Children and Young Persons Commissioner will be able to do. They will also have an oversight facility of children and young people in detention facilities and out-of-home care.

The Child Advocate and the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People will be able to appoint people to be independent visitors. Under that scheme, people who are appointed will be able to visit facilities and people in detention facilities and children in out-of-home care.

My understanding is that the other bodies, including the National Preventative Mechanism, will concurrently hold their powers to visit and inspect detention facilities or places where children and young people are detained to monitor their safety and wellbeing, but this will be an added role for these new commissioners as well. There will also be an inquiry function. The commission will be able to conduct inquiries into services, policies or practices of an organisation or agency, government or non-government agency, and to table reports in parliament on any matter arising in connection with the performance or functions that they have under this act and in doing those inquiries.

Finally, the act also creates a Joint Standing Committee based on the Joint Standing Committee for Integrity that's established under the Integrity act. That committee will be a new Joint House Standing Committee of this parliament with functions and powers, including monitoring and reviewing the performance of the commission and of each commissioner. They will also conduct a review of the commission after three years. There is also a statutory review of five years in the act, so there will be a lot of early information to the committee and to the parliament around any changes that might need to be made.

I will foreshadow that I have a small amendment to move in the committee stage that goes to that joint house committee. I will get to that when we get into the committee stage, but, it will just create an obligation for the minister to consult with that Joint House Committee, once it's established, on appointments to the role of commissioner, which is something that already exists in the same way, for appointments to the role of Integrity Commissioner, the minister needs to consult with the Joint House Standing Committee on Integrity. I'm seeking to move an amendment in the committee stage that would replicate that obligation. I note that the bill already has provision for the minister to consult with members of any party with two or more members in parliament. My amendment retains that requirement, as well as adding a new one to consult with that joint house committee, once it's established as well.

I also want to foreshadow that I understand, in moving that amendment, that the committee probably won't be established in time for this first round of appointments. It is in no way intended to be a delaying mechanism. We want the government to be able to proceed as swiftly as possible, to appointing to those new roles, and I anticipate that in the future when those terms expire, that then this new amendment, if it passes, will come into play and the minister will also need to consult that joint house standing committee.

With those comments, I will resume my seat again. I again indicate that we will support this bill and we really commend the government for bringing this new commission forward so swiftly. All 191 recommendations were compelling and important, and have their own evidence based behind them, but this was one of the ones that jumped out at me early on after the release of that report, just how important it is that we get these oversight mechanisms right. I commend everyone who did work not only on this bill, but also on the commission itself and, most importantly, those Tasmanians who shared their stories with the commission.

[5.42 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, when the commission of inquiry handed down their report, they wrote: 'It is important that children's rights and safety receives the focus and attention it deserves.' For that reason, they recommended a new Commission for Children and Young People to be established. On behalf of the Greens, I'm pleased to indicate that we will be supporting the Commission for Children and Young People Bill 2025.

There are dozens of recommendations from the commission of inquiry that relate to the commission and our assessment is that this bill closely follows these recommendations. There are a lot in here, but I'm going to refer to them, because it's helpful to have the ways that this bill addresses the recommendations on record. I will have some questions along the way, as well.

The commission of inquiry recommendation 18.4.a. and 18.6.2.a. and b. outline that the independent regulator should be embedded within the new Commission for Children and Young People. This relates to an element of the bill that is unclear to me. Clause 7(2)(a) sets out that the commission is composed of the commissioner, the Child Advocate, and the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People. Clause 7(2)(b) sets out that it also includes the Independent Regulator and the Deputy Regulator if these officers are not also held by a commissioner. This means if these officers are held by a commissioner they do not form part of the commission, but if they are held by a separate person they do.

Initially, we thought this may be an error, however, I understand from advice we have sought that it is deliberate. As I understand it, the current Independent Regulator will form part of the commission. However, when all the provisions are proclaimed, it is intended that the Commissioner for Children and Young People will be appointed as the Independent Regulator. That's quite clear to me, but what's not clear is what the rationale is for the independent regulator no longer being part of the commission, when the Commissioner for Children and Young People is appointed to that role. I understand that if it's the same person, the person will be part of the commission by virtue of holding both roles. However, the current Ombudsman, Custodial Inspector and Health Complaints Commissioner are all the same person, but these various roles do not form part of the same office.

The Custodial Inspector is not part of the Health Complaints Commission, for example, despite also being the Health Complaints Commissioner. I would think that the Independent Regulator should be part of the commission regardless of whether or not they also hold another statutory office that is part of the commission. 

As I understand the impacts of this, if the independent regulator is not also the Commissioner for Children and Young People, then they can, for example, perform functions and powers held by, 'The Commission,' including the functions listed in clause 8. However, if the Commissioner for Children and Young People is also the Independent Regulator, then wearing their Independent Regulator hat, they are not considered part of the Commission and, therefore, cannot exercise those same functions and powers under clause 8. 

I note that the COI did not put a qualifier on their recommendation that the Independent Regulator should be embedded within the new Commission for Children and Young People. This appears to deviate from the recommendations and my question is why? What is the purpose of this? We haven't prepared an amendment on this but may consider an amendment in council if there is not a compelling explanation.

COI recommendations 18.61 and 9.331 outline that the commission should include the roles of Commissioner for Children and Young People, Aboriginal Commissioner for Children and Young People, and the Child Advocate as a deputy commissioner, all subject to five yearly appointments. These recommendations are all met, other than the Child Advocate being a deputy commissioner and is instead a full commissioner in this bill. The supporting material for the draft bill argued that it would create conflict of duties of advocacy and regulation if the child advocate was in a deputised position. This is a reasonable explanation, so the Greens consider this deviation justified. 

Paragraphs A and B of COI recommendation 18.7 outlined that the appointments for commissioners and deputy commissioners should be an externally advertised merit-based selection process. The recruitment process for these roles include a nonpartisan adult selection panel with at least one member external to the Tasmanian State Service, and a separate children's selection panel.

Most of these outlined requirements are specifically spelled out in the legislation and we acknowledge that going into this level of detail on these matters in legislation is uncommon. We take the level of detail stipulated in the provisions of this bill as a good-faith effort to align closely with the recommendations. 

That being said, the recommendation that the adult panel be nonpartisan is not in the legislation. In fairness, it is difficult to see how this could be reasonably navigated in the legislation. To reasonably enact this, there would potentially need to be an assessment of political party membership, employment history, and the history of election campaign participation. This could be arduous and invasive, and would potentially disqualify, for example, a person who door-knocked for an Independent or a party candidate in the past.

Very few actual appointments would require such a disqualification. Electoral Commission appointments are the only ones that come to mind, let alone for selection panel membership. 

On this basis we can understand not going down this path. We are, however, interested in hearing an explanation from the government. Was this considered? Were potential definitions of partisan considered? On what basis was it decided to not include this requirement?

COI recommendation 18.7C outlined that the adult and children's selection panels for the role of Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People should have a majority of Aboriginal members. The bill covers off on this recommendation in clause 1(2a) of schedule 1 to the bill. 

COI recommendation 18.7D stipulates that before making a recommendation to the Governor for an appointment to the Commission for Children and Young People, the minister should be required to consult with the leader of any political party with at least two members in parliament. This recommendation is covered in clause 1(3) of schedule 1 to the bill - actually, I think that might be a typo, because it says three people in here.

Recommendation 18.62 states that the commission should have the functions of the current commissioner. In comparing the proposed functions, our view is that the existing powers are fully covered off on. Similarly, recommendation 18.63 provides that the Commission for Children and Young People should have all necessary powers to perform its function. This is a subjective matter, but our read is that it appears to be met.

Recommendation 18.62C outlines that the commission should administer the Independent Community Visitor Scheme for children in out-of-home care, youth detention and other residential youth justice facilities.

The bill provides that the child advocate is to establish an independent visitor scheme that applies to facility residents in a detention facility, children in out-of-home care, and children and young people in other prescribed facilities. I know that other residential youth justice facilities are not spelled out in the legislation but acknowledge that this may be covered by other prescribed facilities. However, given the lack of any other residential youth justice facilities at present, we recognise that may be difficult to define.

Minister, are you able to advise whether it is the government's intention to prescribe, for example, assisted bail facilities?  Are any other facilities in particular being considered for the regulations?

Recommendation 18.6.2. stated the commission should advocate for individual children in out-of-home care, youth detention, and other residential youth justice facilities. As previously mentioned, residential youth justice facilities are currently not covered by the bill. However, under clause 13(2(b)(i), the child advocate can advocate for any individual child or young person, including but not limited to a child or young person in a detention facility or in out-of-home care. Given the non-exhaustive list provided, sufficient scope appears to be provided to meet this recommendation.

Recommendation 18.6.2.e. provides that the commission should monitor the operation of the out-of-home care and youth justice systems and the provision of out-of-home care and youth justice services to children. The functions of the commission include to monitor and review the safety, wellbeing, care and treatment of children and young people in out-of-home care or the youth justice system, and to monitor the operation of detention facilities where facility residents reside.

As far as we can determine, no specific function of monitoring the operation of out-of-home care is in the bill. However, there are many examples of powers and functions that functionally empower the commission and commissioners to monitor the operation of out-of-home care.

Recommendation 18.6.2.f. says the bill should provide for conducting inquiries into the out-of-home care and youth justice systems and the services provided to individual children in those systems, including own-motion enquiries. The child advocate has the power to inquire into youth justice services or out-of-home care services if the child advocate is contacted about the provision of those services to a child or young person. The Commissioner for Aboriginal Children in Young People has similar powers in respect of Aboriginal children or Aboriginal young persons. The commission, more broadly, has powers for inquiry, investigation, and review on systemic matters. This recommendation appears to be covered off on.

Recommendation 18.6.2.g states the commission should have the function of making recommendations to the government for out-of-home care and youth justice system improvements. This is included in the functions of the commission.

Recommendation 18.6.2.h says the bill should provide for promoting the participation of children in out-of-home care and youth justice in decision making that affects their lives. The functions of the commission include to promote and empower the participation of children and young people in influencing decisions and expressing opinions on matters that affect their lives or the lives of all or a specified class of children and young people. While this does not specifically stipulate out-of-home care and youth justice, it is a broader mandate than is recommended and functionally provides for this.

Recommendation 18.6.2.i. relates to upholding and promoting the rights of children in the out-of-home care and youth justice system. The functions of the commission more broadly include to promote and uphold the rights of all or a specified class of children and young people, and the functions of the child advocate specifically include uphold and promote the rights of children and young people in a detention facility or out-of-home care. This recommendation appears to be comprehensively covered.

Recommendation 18.14.4. outlines that while the Commission for Children and Young People should be promoted as the key agency for receiving reports, complaints or concerns relating to conduct towards children. People should be able to raise reports, complaints or concerns with any of these agencies and these agencies should ensure the matter is appropriately referred. The no-wrong-door approach. While the functions do include assisting the making of complaints to other authorities, much of this recommendation isn't specifically relevant to this bill. I would, however, request that the minister outline how the commission will be promoted as the key agency for receiving reports.

Recommendation 9.37 outlines that the secretary of the DYCP should notify the Commission for Children and Young People of sexual abuse allegations involving children in out-of-home care that fall outside the reportable conduct scheme, including incidents of child abuse by non-carers and of the outcomes of investigations into those allegations. The Commission for Children and Young People should have the power to require the department to provide it with information about its responses to such allegations. 

While the bill provides broad powers to compel information, mandatory notification from the secretary is not included in the bill, and I acknowledge that the recommendation was not specifically to legislate this requirement. Can the minister outline how this recommendation is intended to be enacted?

Recommendation 12.17.2. outlines that the Commission for Children and Young People should annually review the use of electronic surveillance in detention to determine whether it increases children and young people's feelings of safety in detention and should continue to be used. The initial review should seek the views of children and young people at Ashley Youth Detention Centre on whether electronic surveillance should be deployed in the proposed new detention facility. The functions of the commission include quite specifically to monitor and review the use of electronic surveillance in detention facilities at regular intervals of not less than 12 months and make recommendations on whether the use of electronic surveillance is appropriate or recommended and on any other matters in relation to electronic surveillance that the commissioner considers appropriate.

Recommendation 12.25.b. outlines that the Tasmanian government should introduce a new process for approving transfers of young people from youth detention to an adult prison facility that requires the Department for Education, Children and Young People to notify the Commission for Children and Young People of any proposed transfer. I note this is not included in the bill but acknowledge that the recommendation was not specifically for something to be legislated. Is the minister able to outline how this recommendation will be enacted?

Recommendation 12.25.d. is for the Magistrates Court to be required, in determining whether to approve a transfer, to consider, among other matters, to seek the views of the Commission for Children and Young People on the appropriateness of the transfer? This is likewise not included in the bill, though I assume this would be required to be legislated. Can the minister outline what the plan is for this recommendation?

Recommendation 12.32.b. was for all incidents of harmful sexual behaviours in youth detention or other residential youth justice facilities to be reported to the Commission for Children and Young People. Again, this isn't included in the bill as far as we can tell. Can the minister outline whether this will be legislated and in what legislation?

Recommendations 12.31.2.e.iii. and 12.33.2.c.iii. are to ensure Ashley Youth Detention Centre and any future detention facility provides the search register, the use of force register and all relevant supporting documentation to the Commission for Children and Young People on a monthly basis or more frequently. This is somewhat addressed in the bill. The commission can request or compel this information as needed and it is explicitly outlined in their powers. However, there is no requirement for this information to be proactively provided on a schedule. Can the minister outline why this approach has been taken?

Recommendation 9.27.c.iii. is to ensure when a child in care is admitted to youth detention or another residential youth justice facility that the child's child safety officer notifies the Commission for Children and Young People of this child's admission to youth detention. This is not included in the bill. Can the minister please outline if there is an intention to legislate this at a later point or if this is to be handled through non-legislative mechanisms.

Recommendation 12.38.b. is to ensure the commission has the power to enter adult prison facilities to visit children and young people in those facilities to monitor their safety and wellbeing.

In this bill, the commission has the power to enter detention facilities, which is defined to include a prison within the meaning of the Corrections Act 1997, where a child or young person may be detained or otherwise reside.

The Corrections Act 1997 defines prison to include a place of detention, irrespective of the title by which it is known, and includes the whole area, whether or not walled or fenced, established as a prison. This is quite broad and would appear to comprehensively cover off on this recommendation.

Recommendations 12.38(C) and 18.8 are to ensure the commission is adequately resourced on an ongoing basis to fulfil its systemic monitoring functions and is separately and directly funded rather than through DCYP. Any funding arrangements or conditions should be structured to ensure the commission has power to control its budget and staffing. While this is not necessarily a matter for legislation, I would like the minister to outline any details they can in respect of how the government intends to address this recommendation.

Recommendation 12.39(A) was to appoint the commission as an additional NPM. While, this is not included in the bill, under the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021, the Governor may appoint a person or more than one person as a Tasmanian national preventive mechanism.

I note that these provisions relate to the appointment of a person as an NPM and the COI recommended the commission, not a commissioner, be appointed as an NPM.

Has the government sought advice on whether or not the wording of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 would allow for the commission to be appointed as an NPM?

Does the government have a position on this matter?

Recommendation 18.9 was for a joint standing committee of the Tasmanian parliament that should oversee the performance and proper execution of functions of the Commission for Children and Young People. This recommendation is adopted in full.

Recommendation 9.35 was for legislation establishing an independent child advocate in the Commission for Children and Young People and should provide the Child Advocate with power to make a complaint to the Ombudsman on behalf of a child who is in out-of-home care, youth detention or another residential youth justice facility, seeking the child's permission to do so first.

The bill does establish a child advocate and they have the power to assist and support any individual child or young person to make a complaint to a statutory complaint authority or to make a complaint on their behalf with the consent of a guardian.

Recommendation 12.38(A) is to ensure the Commission for Children and Young People has functions and powers to monitor youth detention centres, other residential youth justice facilities and the youth justice system more broadly, including regularly monitoring and reviewing custodial population data and information on serious or adverse incidents and the use of isolation, force, restraints and searches, conducting regular on-site inspections and conducting own-motion inquiries into systemic individual or group issues. This is quite a substantial list, and we believe all of these outlined powers and functions are within the bill. 

Finally, recommendation 9.38(1) is that the commission should monitor the out-of-home care system and services to children; monitor data and conducting own-motion systemic inquiries; conducting own-motion inquiries into the services received by an individual, child or group of children in out-of-home-care; making recommendations to the government for out-of-home care system improvements; advocating for children in out-of-home care, including supporting children to make complaints and to apply for independent reviews of departmental decision making; administering the independent Community Visitor Scheme; and upholding and promoting the rights of children in out-of-home care. All these matters appeared to be covered by the bill.

I thank members for their patience, but it's really pleasing to see that so many of the commission of inquiry recommendations have been covered in this piece of legislation. It's a thorough piece of legislation, and the commission will go a long way and will do the work of ensuring that children's rights and safety are an important focus in Tasmania.

I thank the minister for bringing forward this bill and I thank also your staff for the briefing that they provided to our office.

The construction of various provisions of the bill make it clear that considerable effort was put into covering the COI recommendations very closely and we are pleased that this is the case, and on behalf of the Greens, I will just say again that we are pleased to support this bill. 

[6.05 p.m.]
Prof. RAZAY (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I welcome the Commission for Children and Young People Bill as a crucial step by government in response to the commission of inquiry toward establishing an independent commission for children and young people.

This commission will serve an especially important function in further protection of children and young people and ensure that the views of children and young people on matters that affect them will be taken into consideration when making decisions.

I commend the government's proposal to better protect vulnerable children and young people from harm and exploitation, and to recognise, respect and value the contributions made by children and young people.

This commission will have a particularly significant role in advocating, upholding and promoting the right of children and young people and monitoring the operation of out-of-home care and youth justice systems, including youth detention facilities.

My question is in relation to clause 18 of the bill, and the proposed limitation of the commission's authority to investigate and review certain matters under subclause (1), including, in particular circumstances, the application of systems, policies and practices of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Police Service, or Tasmania Legal Aid.

Can the Attorney-General please clarify the definition and provide examples of specific circumstances in subclause (1), paragraph (c), subparagraph (i)? Thank you.

[6.07 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Attorney-General) - Deputy Speaker, I acknowledge the heartfelt response of the various contributors, the shadow attorney-general, the Greens spokesperson, Cecily Rosol, Prof George Razay, and I also acknowledge other members in this place who aren't here and haven't contributed in this debate, who've been part of the process in terms of landing this particular bill to establish what is an incredibly important piece of framework that flows from the commission of inquiry. I want to note that upfront, acknowledge the support and encouragement and of course the many, many questions which I will come to shortly, particularly from the member for Bass on behalf of the Greens, and do my best to respond to those. 

I put on record my sincere thanks for that and indicate upfront that the original lead agency for this bill was actually the Department of Premier and Cabinet. I acknowledge their incredible work in the beginning of the response to the commission of inquiry and then likewise my department that led that hard work. I also acknowledge the Department of Education, Children and Young People which was intimately involved in the preparation of this bill.

I should say, and this has been noted earlier by the shadow attorney-general, and that is this is the 22nd draft of this bill. We've worked so hard as a government with the feedback from so many various stakeholders and members of the community. I want to do a special shout out of course, and acknowledge the victim-survivors who've made contributions that we've taken into account. It's a heartfelt thanks for all that hard work, 22 drafts, and here we are today. I believe we've landed well with this bill. Of course, I will go through in terms of the many questions, but I want to put that on the record. I want to say thank you for the community consultation and feedback.

My department received some 31 submissions, in terms of the community consultation process. I'd like to thank the following organisations for their contributions: The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners; Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service; Carers Tasmania; Tasmanian Council of Social Services; Life Without Barriers; Laurel House; The Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre; Community Legal Centres Tasmania; Jack Davenport; Sally McCutchan [? 6.10.28], The SNAICC's National Voice for Children Sexual Assault Support Service.

In terms of the commission of inquiry, as I've indicated, on 1 December 2023, our government released its formal response to that very substantial report. That was a very important milestone for our government for and on behalf of the people of Tasmania. It outlined the various agency responsibilities, the timeframes for implementing, all the final reports, 191 recommendations across the three phases that many in this Chamber will recall.

The Tasmanian government's committed to implementing all of the commission's recommendation, and, as of October 2025, I'd like to give an update to colleagues in this place and to members of the public, and that is: across government, 54 of the total 191 recommendations have been completed. Today's bill is another example of the government prioritising the commission of inquiry and we're getting on with the job and delivering. There are more than 15 commission of inquiry recommendations that relate directly to the establishment, operation of the new commission and its commissioners, and their roles, functions, powers and responsibilities.

Recommendation 18.6 is the primary recommendation related to the establishment of the Commission for Children and Young People, including a new Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People and a Child Advocate.

Recommendation 18.4 recommends the independent regulator and the deputy regulator are included, as part of the new Commission for Children and Young People. This has been established in the bill with transitional arrangements. I will say more about that shortly, in response to the Greens spokesperson, Cecily Rosol.

Recommendations 9.14, 9.33, 9.34, 9.45, 9.38, 12.17, 12.36, 12.38, 18.4, 18.5, 18.6, 18.7, 18.8, 18.9 are implemented by the bill. I want to put that on the record.

Colleagues in this place will know the very important purposes of the bill, to establish the Commission for Children and Young People, as recommended by the commission of inquiry. The bill, as you know, establishes the following roles, the Commission for Children and Young People, the Commission for Aboriginal Children and Young People and the Child Advocate.

The independent regulator and deputy regulator under the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Act 2023 will also form part of the commission, as I indicated in my second reading. The provisions commenced by proclamation and will be commenced in stages. Consistent with the government response to the commission of inquiry, commencement dates will be staged to align with the timeframes outlined in the Tasmanian government's response to the COI's report, and to reflect the time required to set up the new commission logistically.

Once all provisions are proclaimed, the person appointed as the Commissioner for Children and Young People will also be the independent regulator, this is scheduled to occur after the completion of the current independent regulators term of appointment, and reflects a transition period as was contemplated by the COI.

The bill provides the functions and powers of the new commission and this includes advocating, upholding and promoting the rights of children and young people, and monitoring the operation of the out-of-home care and youth justice systems.

I see Ms Johnston is in the Chamber. I acknowledge the involvement and interest of Ms Johnston with my department and the various briefings and the questions that she has had. I will come to the responses in terms of the definition of 'young person', shortly. Again, I acknowledge the good intent behind that, and in-principle support for that.

I will respond to at a high level - Labor's proposed amendment in terms of Ms Haddad's proposed amendment to the bill that will - I just indicate the government will support this particular amendment to Schedule 1, which builds on the commission of inquiry's recommendations regarding appointment of commissioners and, while the bill as tabled accomplishes those recommendations, the proposed amendment strengthens the COI's recommendations. I acknowledge the intent and the heart behind that as well, and that just provides an extra level of accountability. I think it strengthens the accountability of the minister's consultation process on the appointment of commissioners before making the necessary recommendation to the Governor. It's modelled, at least in part, on the Integrity Commission Act 2009's mechanism for appointment of board members, the chief commissioner and the chief executive officer, and it makes the appointment of commissioners under the bill more stringent than those positions under the Integrity Commission act because they do not also have the requirement pursuant to the COI's recommendations regarding bespoke selection panel.

I just wanted to add to the point there in terms of that particular amendment that, while I'm mindful of the risk of potential delay to the appointment of commissioners to the new commission, our government supports the additional opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny of appointments to these important independent, apolitical statutory positions, which are so integral to the protection and the safety and wellbeing of Tasmanian children. I acknowledge that upfront - I'm sure we will get there in the committee stage - and thank the shadow attorney-general for that. 

I'd just like, before I get to the Greens' questions, to foreshadow to Ms Johnston's amendment, if I could at this stage, and say that we will be supporting Ms Johnston's amendment that's been brought forward by the independent member for Clark. I'd like to thank the member for her engagement on this important bill, as I've just done.

The amendment will amend the definition of young persons so that it means, relevantly, a person who has attained the age of 15 years but has not attained the age of 21 years who:

(e)	is in out-of-home care, or 

(f)	was in out-of-home care before the person attained the age of 18 years.

As I said, the government will be supporting the amendment, which will expand the jurisdiction of the commission to a person who is 18 to 20 years old and was in out-of-home care at any time in their lives. 

I'd like to clarify that this is not correct to say that the bill as tabled only applied to a young person who was in care after they attained the age of 15 years. The bill, I'm advised, applies to any and all children in Tasmania simply by virtue of the definition of child, being anyone aged 17 or younger. The young person issue only becomes relevant for 18- to 20-year-olds. They are only covered if ever involved in youth justice proceedings or in out-of-home care any time since they were 15 and now, with this amendment, it will apply if in out-of-home care at any time.

The definition of young person builds on the definition of vulnerable in the current Commissioner for Children and Young People Act 2016. I am advised it is also why the term young person is defined so differently in this bill to its other uses in Tasmanian legislation where the term remains within the overarching definition of child and thus does not go beyond the age of 17. While there was stakeholder feedback warning that having no countback mechanism could mean too broad a cohort of young people coming within the new commission's jurisdiction, we do want to ensure that no child is left behind and the two statutory reviews will allow for monitoring of the resource implications and needs met. I just put that on the record as well and again I acknowledge the Independent member for Clark. 

To start the responses to the Greens' representative, member for Bass Cecily Rosol, thank you again for your earnest approach to the bill. A very comprehensive assessment and, of course, broad support for the bill for which the government is very grateful, and to just walk through, starting at question one, with respect to the honourable member's questions.

I know some of these have been raised in the briefings and, again, thank you for acknowledging my department, which they've done an incredible job over a long period of time and I might just acknowledge right here and now Vinton Pedley, who has led the charge for and on behalf of the department of Justice with Isabella Comfort and Bruce Patterson's support as well. I put that on the record and sincerely thank you for all the work that you have done to support not only the government but the parliament and the people of Tasmania.

This is a milestone event today with this bill, and you should be very pleased with the efforts that you've made to support this parliament to progress such important legislation. Not to mention members of my office who have likewise supported me and the department accordingly. 

With regard to how the independent regulator will be embedded in the new commission, it is in two stages. Clause 7(2)(b). Clause 7(2) provides that the Commission for Children and Young People includes:

the following persons appointed under this Act:

the Commissioner for Children and Young People;

the Child Advocate;

the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People; and

(b)	the following persons if the office is not held by a Commissioner:

the Independent Regulator;

(ii)	the Deputy Regulator;
The bill proposes that initially the current Independent Regulator and any person appointed to be deputy regulator will be part of the Commission for Children and Young People, the commission, but will not be commissioners. Subclause 7(2) folds the Independent Regulator into the new commission for an initial transitional period while she remains otherwise statutorily separate from it. It also achieves this permanently for the deputy regulator.

That is while two separate people hold the different positions of Commissioner for Children and Young People and the Independent Regulator. Once all provisions are proclaimed, the person appointed as the Commissioner for Children and Young People will also be the Independent Regulator. This is scheduled to occur after the completion of the current independent regulator's term of appointment and reflects a transition period as was contemplated by the commission of inquiry. The Independent Regulator already exists under her own 2023 legislation and her term of appointment expires on 24 January 2029.

With regard to what the commission of inquiry said about this, I will just respond to that question. The COI recommended that the functions of the independent regulator and the deputy independent regulator under the Children and Youth Safe Organisations Act 2023 be embedded within the new commission. It stated and acknowledged there may be a transition period to combine those roles.

The COI reports talked about creating a new body with special skills and knowledge about children's rights and safety, independence, powers and resourcing aimed towards a clearer, more integrated system of oversight of children's safety. The bill further follows the COI's recommendation about the Commissioner for Children and Young People also performing the independent regulator's role so that the Child Advocate and Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People are free to perform individual advocacy.

The COI acknowledged there may appear to be a tension or conflict between the performance of individual advocacy functions and regulatory functions being the independent regulator's role by a single entity. The COI said this could be addressed through the Commission for Children and Young People performing the functions in respect to the Child and Youth Safe Standards and Reportable Conduct Scheme, on one hand, and, on the other, the new Child Advocate and Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People performing individual advocacy functions for children in out-of-home care and youth detention.

How does the bill reflect what the COI said? To avoid conflicts of interest and to maximise the efficiency and efficacy of the existing office of the Independent Regulator and set-up of the new Commission, there is a necessary transition period in which the Commissioner for Children and Young People and Independent Regulator roles will be held by separate individuals. The end state of the new act will see one person appointed to both roles and this is deemed by some provisions in the bill. 

The advice I have is the commencement of the provisions in the bill in stages by proclaiming certain provisions in tranches will provide a transitional period that accommodates existing appointments and provides adequate time for all aspects of the new commission to be developed and staffed.

Once the positions of the Commissioner for Children and Young People and the Independent Regulator are held by the one person, the officers will be strongly integrated through transfer of existing staff to the new independent commission and co-location in office premises. At that time, the Independent Regulator's role will be embedded in the new commission by virtue of this dual appointment.

The bill supports appropriate information sharing between these important parts of Tasmania's child-safe framework and, importantly, will be led by the one person. That's the advice I've received; it's quite extensive. 

For a number of the other questions put, I will just follow through and respond in terms of why does the selection panel implement COI recommendation 18.7 that the recruitment process for those roles include a nonpartisan adult selection panel. Recommendation 18.7 says,

The Tasmanian government should ensure the process for appointing future Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners for Children and Young People adopts the following:

future Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners be appointed following an externally advertised merit-based selection process to ensure they have relevant professional qualifications and substantive experience in matters affecting vulnerable children
	
the recruitment process for these roles include a non-partisan adult selection panel with at least one member external to the Tasmanian State Service, and a separate children's selection panel
	
the adult and children's selection panels for the role of Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People have a majority of Aboriginal members
	
before making a recommendation to the Governor for the appointment to the Commission for Children and Young People, the Minister will be required to consult with the leader of any political party with at least two members in Parliament.

Schedule 1 of the bill provides for the appointment of commissioners and implements COI recommendation 18.7 to the greatest extent possible. The commission's report did not discuss the partisan concept further in the text supporting recommendation 18.7.

Schedule 1 lists various practical, measurable requirements that are all inconsistent with what a partisan selection panel would entail. In other words, it is considered that the provision, as drafted, achieves the COI's recommendations, although it does not use the exact same words. There would be drafting difficulties with using a term such as 'nonpartisan' and any association definition.

I will go on because I believe the shadow attorney-general made these points. We support the views of the shadow attorney-general and the amendment that's been foreshadowed.

There are also requirements around a panel of children and young people. Importantly, when selecting a person to appoint as a Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People, the majority of the members of the selection panel must be known to be Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and the majority of children and young people on the panel have to be Aboriginal children and Aboriginal young people, and I did make that point in my second reading. I believe that covers that particular point.

As for Ms Rosol's question about the meaning of 'residential youth justice facilities' and the submission by the children's commissioner, the bill was amended from the consultation draft to remove the terms 'other residential support facilities' and 'other residential youth justice facilities,' as these terms were superfluous. The commission of inquiry intended them to describe specific sorts of facilities, but these do not yet exist. It is not possible to define something hypothetical. Future contingencies of this nature are covered by adding a 'prescribed facility limb' to the definition of 'detention centre', so I wanted to make that point.

Ms Rosol also raised recommendation 9.37, which involves proactive disclosure by the Department of Education, Children and Young People about children in out-of-home care. That power was not part of the consultation bill and is also not in the final bill, I am advised. It is being considered how it operates with a similar recommendation regarding children and young people in detention. That recommendation, I am advised, is part of a series of others that relate to appointments and operations within DECYP. There is work being done on these recommendations, and relevant information triaged and handled through DECYP will be shared with the commission.

In terms of the recommendation 12.38 being fully implemented, this is phase two of the DECYP-led recommendation. The bill does implement COI recommendation 12.38 by providing that the commission has a function to monitor and review the operation of youth detention facilities and the safety and wellbeing of children and young people within them; and can conduct inspections of facilities where children or young people are in youth detention. The bill provides for entry to and inspection of detention facilities, including the power to enter adult prison facilities if they house young people, to monitor and review the use of isolation, force, restraint, and searchers on children and young people in serious incidents relating to or involving children and young people in detention facilities. It is appropriate that the new commission, once appointed, works with the custodial inspector to fully realise this recommendation.

In terms of the funding issue raised by Ms Rosol, the consult bill contains no provisions that are specifically adapted to give statutory recognition to the commission of inquiries' recommendations about funding and resourcing the proposed commission.

The government has committed funding to establish the new commission. This includes the current funding for the independent regulator and the Commission for Children and Young People with additional establishment funding. Funding for the establishment of the commission was included in the Department of Premier and Cabinet 2024-25 budget. Funding was included separately in the 2024-25 budget and the Department of Justice and Department of Education, Children and Young People for the Office of the Independent Regulator and the Commissioner for Children and Young People respectively. These three funding streams will be combined and transferred to the commission once it is established.

The commission is being established as a state agency under the State Service Act 2000 and the Financial Management Act 2016. This will ensure that the commission has control over the management of its budget and staffing as recommended by the commission of inquiry.

Future budget bids will be managed and assessed in the usual budget process. Any budget issue will be resolved over time once the new operating model has been established. While the new commission would be created as a separate agency as part of the new legislation, it can only receive funding through an appropriation act. As a result, until an appropriation act is passed, any required funding to establish the new commission, such as the new Commissioner for Children and Young People's salary, will be paid by the department from establishment funding. That's the advice I have received. July 2026, the likely date for a supplementary appropriation bill based on Treasury advice.

I think I've touched on most of those queries. I just need to respond to Prof Razay and see if there's any other responses I could provide.

Through you, Deputy Speaker, and thanks again for your indulgence colleagues because I do want to respond to Prof Razay, who put forward a challenging couple of questions. I appreciate your opportunity to be briefed by the department representatives as well. I'm advised accordingly that, pursuant to clause 33, can the minister or commissioner make a request to conduct an inquiry into services, policies, practices of an agency that provides services including the DPP, Legal Aid, Police service despite section 18.

You asked about examples, but I can advise accordingly, the commission can undertake informal inquiries, but there is also a formal inquiry function specifically dealt with under Part 3. All inquiries can be on the commission's own initiative.

A third type of inquiry is a formal one proposed by the minister. The decision to do so is still for the commission to make. The Attorney-General, whoever that is, can request an enquiry, but it's their decision to agree or not to agree to that request.

There is a limit to the commission's jurisdiction, which is set out in Clause 18. This goes to jurisdiction, which is set out in clause 18. This goes to jurisdiction generally; it is not only for inquiries and reflects the intention that the commission has a systemic advocacy function. It is not an individual complaint-handling body and is not to inquire into particular decisions. For formal inquiries, the commission may conduct an inquiry into services, systems, policies or practices of an organisation or agency, government or non-government that provide services that effect children and young people.

Clause 33 includes a non-exhaustive list of services the commission may inquire in to. I hope that assists the honourable member.

Clause 18 prohibits the inquiry into services, policies and practices of the Director of Public Prosecutions, police and Legal Aid in certain contexts. The commission can still conduct a self-initiated informal inquiry into the services, policies, practices, the DPP and police services, other than the specific cases or determinations of whether to apply for family violence orders. I'm advised it can do so similarly in relation to Tasmanian Legal Aid, other than the systems, policies and practices in respect of legal advice. I hope that assists the honourable member.

I'm sure we will end up in Committee shortly. I'm more than happy to respond again to the shadow-attorney's amendment and likewise, the Independent member for Clark's amendment. However, at this point, I profusely thank honourable members for their inquiries, comments and support. I'd also indicate that I'd be more than happy to take further queries or questions directly to me, which I could then respond directly to you, which you could then share with colleagues in the other place, if this was your wish to progress this bill tonight, if at all possible.

Having said that, I really want to say, this is a milestone day for the Tasmanian parliament. It's probably the most important and key recommendation from the Commission of Inquiry. We're making a very significant difference for Tasmanian children. We are making it safer in Tasmania for Tasmanian children, as a result of this legislation. I commend the bill to the House.

Bill read the second time.


COMMISSION FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE BILL 2025 (No. 54)

In Committee

Clause 1 and 2 agreed to
Clause 3 - Interpretation

[6.38 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON - Chair, I wish to move an amendment to this clause, as the Attorney-General alluded to, in his second reading contribution. I thank, at the outset, the government's indication of their support for this particular motion.

To explain, for the context of the Hansard and for those who may not be familiar with this particular amendment. It relates to the definition of a young person in Part 1 Section 1(e) of young persons, which is in the definition of section of the bill. Apparently, the clause defines a young person, for the purposes of the bill, as someone who: 

(e)	was in out-of-home care at any time after they attained the age of 15 years.

This will somewhat randomly exclude a cohort of young people who have had care experience, with all the trauma and subsequent support and advocacy that flows from that experience from being eligible to be part of the commission's activities, under the Community Visitor Program or its Advocacy Program.

In a briefing, I was told by the department that this was to avoid being swamped and that having an age cut-off would allow the commission to focus on more vulnerable young people or those most at risk and in need of support. However, in my view, the commission is being set up to have a protective role for a cohort of children and young people who share the experience of having been in care. We should not be arbitrarily drawing a line to say that some of that cohort are truly in need and others aren't.

If a child under 15, for example, had voted with their feet, if you will, and left home or a care placement, and we do know that for many children and young people there are good reasons for them to do this, and the department, for whatever reason, decided not to pursue another care order, that child would not be eligible for some of the commission's services. Yet their circumstances may be precisely the reason they later need support or advocacy.

My office has liaised with the interim Commissioner for Children and Young People who is supportive of a more permissive approach to the definition of 'young persons' as it relates to those with a care experience. The interim commissioner also said it would be a matter for the new commission on how it manages the capacity consistent with the provisions and principles of the act. That is, she did not advise that having a more permissive definition would create a problem of demand for the new commission. 

The bill itself gives commissioners the discretion to advocate on behalf of a particular child or young person. There should be no fear that this simple and fair amendment will lead to an unmanageable caseload. For your information, section 13(2)(b) child advocate and 14(2) Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People, describes their powers using permissive language - they may advocate, inquire, assist, et cetera. There is no duty clause requiring them to act in every case. 

The interim commissioner's submission to an earlier version of this bill, which has the same definition of the young person in relation to a care experience, makes it clear that young people themselves want the new commission to be able to advocate for the rights of young people aged 18 and above. My amendment is very simple. It replaces E with two paragraphs to be consistent with how proceedings and services under the Youth Justice Act 1997 are to be dealt with in paragraphs A and B of the definition of 'young people'. I move - 

Clause 3, page 11, subclause (1), definition of 'young person', paragraph (e).

Leave out that paragraph.

Insert instead the following paragraphs:

(e)	is in out-of-home care; or

(f)	was in out-of-home care before the person attained the age of 18 years.

I will just get the copy. This change will mean that a person who is in out-of-home care at any age will automatically become a 'young person' for the purpose of this act, i.e. the act will apply to that person up until the age of 21.

I think it's a very simple and fair amendment which aligns the interim commissioner's recommendations in her submission, and I again thank the government for indicating their support and recognition that this sort of clears up an area, but particularly for young people from ages of 18 to 21, as we noted beforehand. 

Mr BARNETT - Chair, I confirm what I shared earlier and thank the honourable member for Clark, Ms Johnston, for bringing this amendment forward. I also acknowledge the Interim Commissioner for Children and Young People and the submissions and the contributions that she has made through the process and acknowledge that and her support for this. 

It's an improvement to the bill, makes it more comprehensive and clearer that it applies to all children in Tasmania from out-of-home care in that age bracket as outlined.  I've outlined my support earlier reasonably comprehensively. Again, I acknowledge the honourable member and thank her for bringing the amendment forward.

Ms HADDAD - Chair, we will also support the amendment and acknowledge the government's support for it as well. I think the member for Clark explained it very well: that it would exclude a cohort of people who would quite understandably expect to be within the jurisdiction of the commission. It could lead to some pretty unintended consequences and some pretty sad outcomes if they sought that advocacy and weren't able to receive it. We will support the amendment as well. 

Ms ROSOL - I confirm that the Greens will support this amendment.

Amendment agreed to.

Clause 3, as amended, agreed to.

Clauses 4 to 59 agreed to.

SCHEDULE 1 - APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSIONERS

Ms HADDAD - Deputy Chair, this is also a fairly straightforward amendment. I've sought advice from the clerks to move both the first and second amendment at the same time because otherwise it won't make any sense. I will read it into the Hansard. I move -  

First amendment

Page 81, clause 1, subclause (3)

Leave out everything after 'The minister is to consult'.

Insert instead the word 'with'.

Second amendment

Page 81, clause 1, subclause (3), at the foot of the subclause.

Insert the following paragraphs:

At least one representative of each political party that has two or more sitting members in the parliament at that time; and

The joint committee, if the members of the joint committee are appointed at that time. 

For clarity, I will explain the amendment to the House. Currently the bill, on page 81, clause 1 subclause (3), makes it a requirement for the minister, before recommending to the Governor an appointment under the act, that the minister is to consult with at least one representative of each political party that has two or more sitting members in the parliament at that time. My amendment retains that requirement for the minister to consult in that way, but adds a second layer of consultation that the minister is to consult with members of the joint committee that is also established under this bill. 

This amendment mirrors the requirements of the minister to consult with the Joint Standing Committee on Integrity when making appointments to or making recommendations to the Governor for appointments to that commission. This will mirror that requirement for appointments to the new Commission for Children and Young People, but it also retains what the government had in their original drafted section, which is that the minister will have the opportunity also to consult with representatives of political parties that have two or more members in the parliament. It's my understanding, that doesn't exist for the integrity commission appointments, rather in that act the minister is to consult with the joint committee or with the leaders of political parties in the event of being in caretaker or the committee not being established. 

Lastly, I will explain the wording of my new Part B, which is that if the members of the joint committee are appointed at that time, the reason for that is an understanding that this bill establishes the committee, so it won't likely be established in time for consultation for this first round of appointments. Maybe, but I didn't want this amendment to lead to any delays in establishing the commission and making recommendations for appointments. For that reason, IPC's advice was to phrase it in that way. In other words, if the committee exists, it's consulted with, if it doesn't, then the minister will still have the obligation to consult with at least one representative of each political party with two or more sitting members in the parliament. I'm grateful for the minister's indication of support.

Mr BARNETT - Chair, I thank the honourable member. The amendment that I have just received is slightly different to the earlier one.

Ms Haddad - This could be a copy/paste error on my part.

Mr BARNETT - It's possible. Can I just draw to your attention in B the wording that I had seen and approved and agreed was as follows.

The Joint Committee, if the members of the Joint Committee are appointed at that time.

Ms HADDAD -That's what I've moved. I think you might have a printout of the old one.

Mr BARNETT - The amendment I have in front of me says:

The Joint Committee, if appointed at the time, the recommendation is made. 

That was the one that the Clerk gave me. Let's just clarify. The Clerk might confirm which amendment? If we've got clarification and confirmation of the version that the government supports, of course we'll be supporting it.

Ms Haddad - I have moved the version you're expecting.

Mr BARNETT - Do we need to clarify that with the Clerk? I will just check through the Chair.

DEPUTY CHAIR - Read the amendments again, please.

Ms HADDAD - Sure. Schedule 1:

First amendment 

Page 81, clause 1, subclause (3). 

Leave out everything after 'the minister is to consult'. 

Insert instead 'with. 

Second amendment 

Page 81, clause 1, subclause (3), at the foot of the subclause.

Insert the following paragraphs.

At least one representative of each political party that has two or more sitting members in the Parliament at that time; and

The Joint Committee, if the members of the Joint Committee are appointed at that time.

Mr BARNETT - There we go. This is why we're doing this job. We get it right. We go down and we cross the t's, and we dot the i's. We get the job done. It is collaboration and eagle eyes, little bit of legal background here with the eagle eyes happening. So we got there, and I appreciate the indulgence of the shadow attorney-general and also the support of my advisers to get it right.

We support this amendment. As I said earlier, it's providing a little bit more of a robust process, more accountability. So rather than just going to each political party, the two sitting members or more, it's also going to the Joint Committee if the members of the Joint Committee are appointed at that time. Of course, there's a timeframe here. As you know, we're trying to get the commission and the commissioner appointed by 31 March because that's the deadline that we're working towards, which is when the current interim commissioner's term expires. Obviously we need to progress as soon as possible.

We're not sure exactly when that Joint Committee will be established, but if it is established, they will be consulted. If they're not, then we can still progress accordingly. We support that. We thank the honourable shadow attorney-general for that, and I thank the House for the indulgence to be able to get that right and to dot the i's and cross the t's.

Having said that, I think that might be the last amendment. I'd like to through you, Chair, just quickly say thank you again to my department staff, as I said earlier, to everyone who's been involved, particularly to the victim-survivors for their incredible contribution and support. We acknowledge them tonight. This is a milestone day for Tasmania, and Tasmanian children will be safer as a result of this legislation. I thank all members of this place for their support and encouragement to progress this important milestone legislation, and I commend the bill to the House.

Gaming Care Officers

[6.57 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise today to speak about the government's proposal for gaming care officers released yesterday for consultation. Let's be very clear, this initiative is not based on evidence, not recommended by experts and not driven by harm minimisation. It is being pushed by the gambling and hospitality industry, the very sector that profits from the harm. Once again, the gambling industry is writing the policy, and this government is signing off on it.

The proposal is to fund so-called 'gaming care officers,' with the government saying that at least one would be located at each of the three regions of Tasmania. Not one per venue, not even one per local government area, one person for an entire region tasked with reducing harm across dozens of pokies venues.

We are asked to believe that one officer with no authority to intervene and no power to enforce anything will make a meaningful dent in gambling harm. Meanwhile, pokies in pubs and clubs strip more than $190 million every year from Tasmanian households. That's money not going to groceries, rent, school shoes or medical appointments. This proposal is simply not credible.

There has never been an expert in gambling harm who has said, 'What we need is a roaming officer employed by the industry' - not in an inquiry, not in research, not in any evidence-based framework.

Experts, academics and lived-experience advocates repeatedly call for gold-standard reform, a universal player card with mandatory default loss limits, a system that actually stops escalating losses and gives people a circuit breaker before harm occurs. That reform is backed by evidence, and has the support of the Tasmanian Liquor and Gaming Commission and lived-experience groups. It is also backed by the Alliance for Gambling Reform who say, 'Based on the information provided, the Alliance for Gambling Reform cannot support the gaming care officers being proposed.' The model of officers employed by Hospitality Tasmania is yet another example of government asking industry to regulate itself.

The government should ignore industry lobbying and return to mandatory card player pay systems with binding loss limits - the gold standard to prevent harm and whilst we're talking about mandatory player pre-commitment cards, dare we say the government ought to look to its own Deloitte report? That would be the report that has gone missing. The report that the government is sitting on, despite the fact the Premier committed to releasing it 'shortly' over a year ago.

The government says the initiative for gaming care officers is modelled on South Australia. Yet, this year pokies losses in South Australia broke the $1 billion mark, for the first time. If that is the model, we should be running in the very opposite direction. The industry knows that a player card, with default loss limits, would actually work. It would reduce losses and reduce their profits. Which is exactly why they don't support it and why they do support gaming care officers. It lets them look responsible, while nothing changes.

If the government is serious about reducing gambling harm, not just looking like it, the answer is simple: stop letting the gambling industry write their policy; invest in reforms that work; give Tasmanians a mandatory precommitment player card. Put people before pokies' profits.


Longford Show

[7.01 p.m.]
Mr SHELTON (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to pay tribute to the wonderful committee of the Longford Show Society, who successfully ran the 168th Longford Show on Saturday 18 October. It was an exceptional day, with the weather gods looking after us, with a beautiful spring day full of sunshine, and the bumper crowd through the gates was fantastic.

This year's show saw the return of the much-loved chocolate wheel after a few years hiatus. Crowds gathered around the truck for the many spins, and winners were able to choose from the array of prizes specifically sought for the occasion. Young children were delighted by the animal nursery, where they could pet lambs, goats, chicks and ducklings, and they learned about farm animals in general. Our very own Tassie Devil, Rum'un, made an appearance, captivating AFL fans young and old and obliging many with selfies and photos for the parents. Paw Patrol characters Chase and Marshall, also made an appearance alongside Sonic the Hedgehog, creating mayhem and jubilation with the children when they arrived. Rides, showbags, dagwood dogs, chips and fairy floss were all popular, as were the dog and sheep displays.

This year's show had a special inclusion and presentations not normally seen at the annual event. The Tom Talbot Wool Shed was officially opened in the days prior to the show, a great honour for the Talbot family, which recognised Tom's dedication to the wool industry throughout his career and his volunteer service to the show society. Showcasing Tom's career in wool and sheep classing and show judging, the Tom Talbot Wool Shed is a wonderful tribute to a man who played a key role in establishing the fleece competition at the Longford Show.

Another special presentation was made to Joan Barnes, from Longford. As a dedicated volunteer and general committee member of the show society, since 1985, Joan was awarded a life membership, to thank her for her many years of valuable service. Congratulations to the Talbot family, and to Joan Barnes for these wonderful tributes - awards for a lifetime of dedication and commitment to the local community.

A country show is always a great event to attend, and the Longford Show Society is doing a phenomenal job in continuing the show tradition. I look forward to the 169th show next year, and commend the committee for their hard work and dedication, in making the show the great success that it was this year.


TasTAFE - Cuts

[7.04 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise this evening to talk about the TAFE cuts that are happening to the current courses in lab-tech, arts, and screen and media. I seek the leave of the House to table two documents, which are petitions that have been prepared, but unfortunately do not conform with the Standing Orders. These documents have been circulated to the leaders of business in each of the major parties, to the Clerks and to each of the Independents. I have some hard copies if anyone else is interested in those at this moment. 

Leave granted; papers tabled.

Ms BADGER - Thank you, honourable Speaker. Both of these petitions are about important TasTAFE courses, courses which have had their subsidies cut recently, as I mentioned, in the arts, screen and media, and lab tech as well. While these courses' subsidies have been cut to TasTAFE, it's essentially just priced students out. The courses are not going to run into the future. It's simply not good enough. 

But, Skills Tasmania are providing subsidies to private RTOs so that they can run these courses. For example, in lab-tech, the RTOs that are going to be running the possible courses that have been cut at TasTAFE, they actually have no physical presence here in Tasmania. It's simply not good enough. There's been no data provided to members to actually provide the success rates of completion or for employment after studying through the RTOs that we, Tasmanian taxpayers, are subsidising to justify the money going to them, to the interstate agencies over TasTAFE. 

The justification for these cuts, as we've heard from the minister just this morning, is the high rates of students dropping out of the courses or low numbers of students studying. To be clear, there are a variety of reasons that might lead to students dropping out of a course, and that includes getting employment early. What a fantastic result. Isn't that the whole point?

For these courses, there are actually no statistics, though, of the past students on why they left those courses. Yes, some of these courses only have a dozen or two dozen students enrolled, but these courses have waitlists. They have the limited number of students because there simply aren't enough teachers. These are courses that should be expanded, evidently, and not reduced. Both of these petitions, in summary, are calling on the cuts to be reversed.

The Save TasTAFE's Laboratory Technology Courses Petition was signed by 661 petitioners as of yesterday, and that had been running since 13 October.

Over 50 per cent of the graduates from the lab tech-course actually go on to be employed in our health system, which is in a crisis. They go on to be employed in pathology. They go on to be employed in industries such as mining. 

School science lab technicians had a recent survey which they shared with members just today. It was undertaken by those also organising the petition, and that showed an overwhelming percentage of the school science lab technicians received employment while studying. As I said before, that's a great outcome. The completion of the lab-tech courses from international students is close to 100 per cent. Minister Ellis has quoted around 40 per cent completion rate for this course in 2024. That is actually correct. That's also incredibly low compared to every other year that the course has been running. You can't just pick that one off and cherry-pick it and use it to cut the course. It's simply not good enough. Also, for context, provided by those in lab-tech, was that the open enrolment policy for students puts most courses at around a 60 per cent completion rate. The numbers in the Diploma of Lab Tech have been consistently lower since Skills Tasmania withdrew funding in 2016, which meant course fees went up to the commercial rate ever since, over $10,000.

The Save Affordable Arts and Screen in Tasmania Petition was signed by over 2117 petitioners, and that ran from 8 October through to 29 October, when that statistic came in. A former TasTAFE teacher of five years said:

I can tell you firsthand these courses bring so much value to students, more than just learning about the creative industries, they bring confidence and connection, and it is a pathway to growth.

These cuts don't really align with the Tasmanian Skills Plan of 2024 to 2028 because page 8 has a beautiful glossy promotional picture of fashion and design which has now been cut. 

Where's the consultation with UTAS, who are also restructuring and cutting aspects of their arts? Where was the Arts Minister advocating for cultural and social inclusion, breaking down benefits and the mental health benefits that bring with studying in the arts?

Time expired.


Public Sector - Pay Dispute

[7.09 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Thank you, honourable Speaker, and I rise to talk about public sector pay. Last week saw three large rallies for public sector workers in both frontline and other positions held in the north-west, the north and on the lawns outside this place. I want to send a shout out to those workers, supporters and their unions. You sent a clear message to the government. Wages are not keeping pace with inflation, nor cost of living. The gap between Tasmanian public sector wages and those on the mainland is unacceptable. Conditions are often poor, causing burnout and fatigue. 

The government's offer falls well short of public expectations. Workers don't walk off the job lightly. They are concerned that they have been in the sights of the government. Only a few months ago, in March, public sector workers were concerned of job cuts with the then treasurer Barnett's DOGE-style Efficiency and Productivity Unit. We heard this morning Treasurer Abetz's small government mantra which fails on all counts to meet the needs of Tasmania's circumstances and our population.

Right now we are seeing vacant positions not being filled. We are hearing in our electorate offices of the dubious dismissals, the positions not being replaced, people being overlooked for jobs in professions where there are shortages, such as nursing and other medical professions. This all comes down to political choices the Treasurer will make when he hands down his interim budget or his first budget and subsequent budget in May.

He could extend the respect to public sector employees, the dignity of fair pay, by funding public sector wage rises and better conditions, but we know that there will be resistance to improving public sector wages and conditions because of more pressing priorities of this government. There will be no new taxes to adequately fund a functioning public sector and the government wants to build a stadium at Macquarie Point. The Macquarie Point stadium, with no cap on its price tag now well north of $1 billion. The bogus argument that this is an essential infrastructure project.

Moreover, we have the Labor Party in lockstep with the government on both these issues, effectively selling workers short of a result. This is not the way to treat public sector workers, and I remind the House that during the last parliament we saw Saputo workers in the north-west who went on strike for a remarkable 20 weeks to secure pay parity with their mainland counterparts, eventually receiving a 21.7 per cent pay rise. This House passed a unanimous motion in support of those workers because it was the right thing to do.

It's not only about pay. Working conditions in Tasmanian schools and hospitals are so poor that we see trained staff leaving in droves to work in other states. A one-year deal won't cut it for public sector workers. Tasmanian workers deserve certainty and the chance to plan for the future. Public sector workers should not be taken for granted. People are still concerned for their jobs. The budget is not looking good. This is a government with an austerity agenda in mind and that will undoubtedly hurt Tasmanian workers; it will hurt Tasmanian business, and it will hurt those relying on public sector services.

My office has heard from trained nurses desperate to work in our health system, but the hiring process is deliberately made to be frustratingly slow. Meanwhile, we continue to spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on locum health workers and their accommodation costs. Until workers in Tasmania can imagine a future here, they can realise their dreams without the need to move interstate, we will continue to see many young people leave for better paying conditions. We are already seeing workers closer to retirement age leaving their jobs because of poor pay and conditions.

This is not reasonable. The Greens stand by Tasmania's public sector workers who deserve respect. They deserve better wages and conditions and we therefore call on the government to negotiate in good faith. 


Indigenous Business Month

[7.14 p.m.]
Mrs ARCHER (Bass - Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to acknowledge that October marked the 11th year of Indigenous Business Month, a celebration that shines a light on the remarkable talent, resilience and enterprise of First Nations business people right across Australia.

Here in Lutruwita/Tasmania, we have every reason to be proud. Last week Hobart's Princess Wharf came alive with the sound and spirit of community as the Palawa Business Hub hosted its second Aboriginal Business Showcase. The gathering allowed Tasmanian Aboriginal business owners to come together to share their stories and showcase their work. From handmade art and design to food and fashion, the showcase captured the strength and diversity of Aboriginal enterprise in our state. For some, it was the first time they had ever presented their business publicly. The pride was unmistakable and the support from the community overwhelming.

As many members would know, the Palawa Business Hub was co-founded by Leah Cameron and Sara Maynard, and it has been a fantastic success story that has changed the landscape for Aboriginal entrepreneurs in Tasmania. Run by Aboriginal people, for Aboriginal people, it is a one-stop shop for guidance, mentoring and connection.

I recently attended their first birthday celebrations and in just a year the hub's business directory has doubled to include more than 60 Aboriginal owned enterprises, which is a fantastic example of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people backing themselves and each other.

This kind of initiative embodies what the Tasmanian government's Closing the Gap commitments are all about. Genuine partnership and shared decision-making to support strong economic participation and development for Aboriginal people and communities.

The work of the Palawa Business Hub is not just about business, it's about empowerment, self-determination, opportunity and creating pathways for the next generation to thrive.

I acknowledge Leah and Sara for their leadership and vision and every Aboriginal business owner who took part in the showcase for their courage, creativity and contribution. Tasmania is richer economically, culturally and socially because of their success and it's wonderful to see Aboriginal people supporting one another to dream big, build strong and share their success with the community.

I look forward to seeing the continued growth of the Palawa Business Hub and to celebrating even more Aboriginal business success stories in the years ahead.


Ron Barwick Prison - Petition

[7.17 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise this evening to present a petition, but it's not a normal petition. This is a petition on behalf of people detained in division 4 of Ron Barwick Prison. I don't have signatures to table because the signatories are people currently detained in prison and any communication they send out from prison is opened and checked before being released. To get this petition out, they dictated it over the phone to someone outside the prison, who then emailed it to me.

I present the petition now as sent to me.

We, the undersigned, being the residents of Division 4, Ron Barwick Minimum Prison, do unanimously agree to being collectively represented when being considered for a response to the following concerns.

1.	Was the mental wellbeing of inmates of Division 4, hereafter residents, given proper consideration in the process of deciding upon and announcing the decision to introduce bunk bed furniture to the cells within Division 4 for the purpose of shared-cell accommodation of residents?

2.	Was the suitability of cells of a footprint of approximately 3 metres by 2.5 metres considered from a health and safety perspective when making this decision? Was particular consideration with regard to adequate ventilation and appropriate privacy and dignity given for a two-person sleeping quarter with in-cell toilets being the only available toilets within Division 4?

3.	Was the primary factor in making this decision to relieve pressure on the accommodation within medium security? If so, was it considered that this decision may be counterproductive and disincentivise inmates from the perceived reward of moving from medium security to minimum security, when doing so would result in moving into doubled-up cell arrangements?

4.	Was the security of residents' possessions, particularly medications, and the heightened risk of conflict over cell assets - TVs, radios, lights, et cetera, considered when making this decision?

5.	In reference to point 4, was the potential for increased workload pressures on corrections staff considered when making this decision?

Thank you to the residents of Ron Barwick Prison for alerting us to this situation and to the person who helped get these concerns out.

I note the steps people in Tasmanian prisons had to take to get word out about bunk beds being built in prison cells. They couldn't simply send a letter. They couldn't send out a sheath of signatures with their petition. One assumes they didn't feel they could go to the Custodial Inspector. Instead they had to dictate their petition over the phone and ask someone else to send it on their behalf. This is why the Custodial Inspector amendment protection from the Reprisal Bill 2025 is so important. It is designed to provide protections for people in prison who report concerns and issues to the Custodial Inspector.

We have a problem in our prisons. Prisons and corrections in Tasmania have been chronically underfunded. Rehabilitation is barely accessible. Community corrections are underfunded. Conditions in our prisons are deteriorating and lockdowns are increasing. There is a terrible negative feedback loop happening in our prisons. Conditions are terrible, people in prison are not being rehabilitated and the result is they are more likely to end up back in prison not long after release.

The Custodial Inspector 2024-25 annual report captures the interaction between all these factors. About time out of cells, it says time out of cells:

… allows them to access rehabilitation programs, participate in work, maintain contact with family and community, access lawyers, and take part in recreational activities. Without these various activities, the correctional system only serves to warehouse people during their sentence. These individuals are then released back into the community with little to no rehabilitation or reintegration planning, and are essentially being set up to fail.

It's a terrible situation. Combine it with this government's predilection for locking people up and it is no wonder our prisons are overflowing, which is why bunks are being added into single cells in Ron Barwick Prison. The government needs to build a bigger prison. To do that, they need to move some people into Ron Barwick and cram them into small cells designed for one.

This government needs to take rehabilitation seriously. They need to invest in staff and processes that keep people out of lockdown in our prisons. Instead, they're funding a stadium we don't need. Their choice is to prioritise a debt-making project that will only lead to less investment in services Tasmanians need, including people in our prisons who deserve to be treated humanely.

This petition is now a matter of public record and I call on the minister to answer the questions it raises.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Delegation to the AFL in Victoria

[7.22 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to highlight the recent delegation of elected representatives who travelled to Melbourne to meet with the AFL to put to them the views of our constituents and challenge them to justify their position on the stadium at Macquarie Point, in the face of the expert planning recommendation that it should not be built given the escalating budget crisis, and against overwhelming community opposition that denies the project a social licence.

In June, elected representatives first wrote to the AFL requesting a meeting. That correspondence was both ignored and gazumped by the prorogation of parliament, so, in the wake of the recent election we wrote again. Eighteen elected representatives, two local mayors, most of the crossbench, members of the Legislative Council, Greens, independents and JLN senators, and the local member for the federal House of Representatives. Significantly, the local mayor and every non-major party state representative of the central Hobart area, the very location of the stadium, and every non-major party federal representative signed on to that letter.

The first response was a simple acknowledgement:

We appreciate your concern and want you to know that whilst we may not respond to your specific email directly, it has been forwarded on to the office of the CEO.

It felt like the AFL was bluffing, so I sent it on to other AFL contacts with the request it be followed up. Eventually, there was a reply from the new COO, Tom Harley, a Geelong premiership captain and well-regarded Sydney Swan CEO, recently elevated to the AFL executive. While initially signalling that it would be inappropriate to meet ahead of the parliamentary vote, to his credit Mr Harley agreed to a meeting, but not before a couple of more messages and notification that we were coming anyway, come what may. We called their bluff.

Last Wednesday, member for Clark, Ms Johnston, member for Franklin, Mr George, member for Hobart, Ms O'Connor and I travelled to Melbourne at our own expense for a 12.00 p.m. meeting at AFL House. Let me be clear here, as I was in the lead up to the delegations visit, this was not about changing the AFL's mind there and then in the meeting and have them come out and pull up their anchor - no stadium, no team. Why would they, with the Labor Party writing a blank cheque for the Rockliff government no matter the impacts on the heritage of Hobart, including the Cenotaph; no matter the stakeholder and community opposition; and no matter the cost and debt crisis? Why would they?

In the absence of the Rockliff government, accurately representing the interests of Tasmanians and pushing the AFL to renegotiate; with the Labor Party not just missing in action, but complicit in action. It was up to the 18 representatives to put the perspective of the majority of Tasmanians, who don't support the stadium. Poll after poll has demonstrated majority opposition to the stadium. It varies depending on where you poll, but the majority oppose the stadium.

We opened the meeting with strong support for the Devils, support for the teams, the High Performance Centre and the $130 million upgrade for York Park, one of the best playing surfaces in the country and an arena for AFL games for almost 25 years. But of course, the conversation soon settled and centred on Mac Point.

We welcomed the chance to put to the AFL that where they thought they picked a winner two and a half years ago, when the licence agreement was signed, things have changed significantly. Where once a roof stadium at Mac Point, of 23 000 seats looked like a positive part of a successful Devils club, it was now a net negative. With a lack of social licence, explicit planning refusal and immense cost in a profound budget crisis, the stadium is now a corrosive agent, eroding public goodwill, for the teams and for the brand of the AFL.

Where the Devils once presented an opportunity to unite Tasmanians around our rightful place in the national competition, hitching them to a derided and discredited white elephant - that has done nothing but deceive and divide - has a sad, predictable end.

The meeting was professional, and to the credit of Mr Harley, he heard us out, and we gave them something to think about. We walked out knowing the AFL had nothing. Nothing of substance to justify their position, given the community concerns, the planning rejection, the budget crisis. Nothing to say but 'a deal's a deal'. Everybody knows agreements can be renegotiated. Tasmania has already breached this one. If the Legislative Council do the right thing and refuse the stadium, with the momentum behind the club, with the existing stadiums we have and with some champions in the AFL - we walked out believing that it can be done - we can have the teams we deserve, without trashing the waterfront, breaking the budget and shafting the very people the Devils need to succeed: key stakeholders and the actual community they need to cheer them on.


Frog Newman - Tribute

[7.27 p.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about a pretty remarkable individual. I get in the habit of not checking my phone come weekends and put it aside. A couple of weeks ago, I wish I'd checked it. I got a message on the Friday, from my old football coach's wife. He was on his deathbed; he fell ill pretty quick, went into palliative care and then they medicated him until he passed on. His message was to me, it said -

Thank you, for your friendship. I've really enjoyed my time with you. You're a bloody good man. Keep those parliament bastards honest. You're doing a great job and I'll see you on the other side.

Frog.

Now, Frog came up to me when I was 19. I was playing in the reserves at the time. I got 10 minutes, kicked a couple of goals and Frog was the coach of the opposing side, which was Burnie. He came up to me after the game, he said, 'You will never get anywhere here, boy.' He said, 'They will never change. We're going to do a trade and we're going to take you across to Burnie.' That's where I went. 

I was there one week, I didn't train on the Tuesday. I turned up late for training on the Thursday night and Frog came up to me and he said, 'I'm going to upset a few people here this week, I'm throwing you in on Saturday. Don't let me down,' and off he walked. If you knew from Frog Newman, he was a big man, he was a scary man. He's the only player I've seen on the football field where opponents actually cried when he walked towards them through fear, and that is the honest to God truth.

He threw me in that Saturday and we came up against Smithton, which was the best side in the comp. They had stars all the way through the centre of the field. They were all big men, and all we had was - in his own words - 'a bunch of bunch of whippets and tryhards'. His coaching method that day was to kick it out to the flanks - out to our whippets - to run it down the boundary line, to stay away from their stars and then at the last minute, kick it in to me and a fellow called Chris Saunders, that was past his prime in football. He came from the South, he came to Burnie. Guess what? We beat them that day. They won the flag that year, we were bottom of the ladder.

I learned a lot off of Frog. I had such a good time that year. We were the only side to walk off the field; we did that against Ulverstone and we called for a head count. There was a lot of stuff going on, and Frog said 'Bugger this', and kicked the football over the grandstand and off we went. He saved the committee at the club the trouble of sacking him. He took it on the chin and resigned, and he moved on. I had such a good time in my short time there. He went to Yolla. A year later, I went up to Yolla. I think I only played one game and I broke my wrist, and he brought me in for the grand final. Once again, he said, 'I'm going to throw you in for the final, don't let me down.' Well, I won a flag.

The next year, I thought I owed the club, so I went back for another year and guess what? I played a full year and I won another flag. Then Frog went on to coach Wynyard. Wynyard had no money at the time, so they went for a budget coach, and what he instilled in that club with solidarity, there was no one bigger than him, everyone else was equal.

The next year, Colin Robinson, who played for the Norm Smith medallist for Hawthorn, came along, took over the club and all Frog's good work - Colin just added the polish to it and we had some success there. We would have won the flag that year, except for the semifinal. I dislocated my shoulder. I was a prime mover then. Corey Robinson got reported and Scotty Walker did a hamstring or something. Our three prime movers were gone and that was it. 

But one of the biggest things Frog said to me, my first forum, running for an election, I was nervous as buggery, and all these people turned up to the point at West Park, and he could see I was nervous. I didn't know what to say. He came up to me and he said:

Write this down, Couta. There's two things in this job you gotta remember, raw honesty and sense of community, and if you stick to that, you won't go wrong.

He was right, and here I am. I never thought I'd get here. He was such an amazing man. He also stated if you can have success on the football field, you will have success in life. It's all about commitment and preparation, and football's a team game. Much the same as what we are in here, but a little bit different. But we're all working to the same goal. So, this is for Frog. What a great man. He was an absolute leader. There has never been anyone in my life that will come close to him, and I can't see anyone in the future coming close to him. He was representative of a bygone era where men were men, and the sheep were nervous.


David Perry - Tribute


[7.32 p.m.]
Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Management) - Honourable Speaker, I'm going to have to shamelessly steal that one, Mr Garland, at some point in time.

We're lucky in life to meet some extraordinary people that - you could say the glue that holds communities together. In the small community that I live in, one of those people was David Perry. David was a wonderful man, heavily involved in historical machinery. The little grey Fergie on a stick as you're driving through Sassafras. One of two significant monuments that we have in our local area, along with the Premier's big spud. A massive contributor to local community events, and in the world that I knew David, a big contributor to the Sassafras Fire Brigade.

David and his wife, Gloria, always host our annual Christmas party. They bred pretty much 50 per cent of the firefighters that are currently in the Sassafras Fire Brigade, and are always there giving of their time, coming through to the brigade after training and after meetings. Just being there to break bread and be part of the community and be part of the institution.

David passed away over the course of this last year and at our Sassafras Christmas celebration, which we hold very early being, you know, the importance of fire season and everyone doing their job during that time, we honoured David and his wife, Gloria, with a new perpetual award to be given to someone in the Sassafras Brigade that demonstrates a legacy of leadership, that really speaks to the kind of man that David was, his integrity, his love of community and the strong commitment that he had through volunteerism. It's an important moment in the life of any brigade to name an award after someone, but particularly for someone like David Perry, with a contribution that he made to our local community.

The outstanding individual who received the David Perry Award, Will Colerick, is a hugely committed firefighter and received a number of accolades during our Christmas event this year, but none more so significantly than the David Perry Award. It is a credit to Will, but even more so to David and Gloria. 

An honourable mention to our firefighter of the year this year, Brendan Rockliff,  a great man, relatively new firefighter, very committed and very keen. Brendan has been advocating to be awarded the firefighter of the year for about 12 months since the last one was handed out and controversially Brendan missed out. We're really grateful for the service that Brendan has put in. I've been with him on a number of jobs and he is becoming a very skilled and committed firefighter, and the worthy recipient of the firefighter of the year for the mighty Sassafras Brigade.

We also awarded a range of different medals for many people in our brigade who've served 10 and 20 years long service with the TFS and also the Operational Service Medal with a number of Sassafras Fire Brigade members taking part in the West Coast complex bushfires.

During the recent weeks, I had the privilege of being there for the Southern Region Medal presentation for National Medals and we have had some extraordinary people serving the Tasmanian Fire Service and the community. The 55-year class for the National Medal for Service to Robin Howlett (AFSM) of Campania and Peter Meyburn of Parratta with 55 years extraordinary commitment. Michael Dunbabin and Robert Hill received the 45-year class, Nigel Goodwin, Scott Perry, Lindsay Kingston, Jim Mulder, Glendon Jackson and David Archer received the 35-year class. Colin Goode, Andrew Zelensky, Nicholas Barter, Rocco Mangione, Stuart Madsen, Dion Grace, Graham Facey and Darren Norman received the 25-year class. While the National Medal for 15-year service went to Brett Seabrook, Ben Gear, Nicholas Moore, Jeremy Duggan, Stephen Franklin, David Orpen, Michael Conway, Stuart Conway, Alastair Cook, Jake Breen, Kurt Walters, Thomas Wilshere, Stephen Whelan, William Bylet, Matthew Blunt and Maurice Baker.

We're all very grateful for their service to their communities and through the Tasmania Fire Service and the commitment shown. 

Time expired.


Reflections and Learnings - Report into Salmon Mass Mortality Event

[7.37 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, yesterday the government released its long-overdue multi-agency report into their response to last summer's mass salmon mortality called Reflections and Learnings. Unfortunately, it was a whitewash. It didn't land a single bit of blame or make any serious actions for genuine changes to prevent this happening again. Taking us back, we can never forget the months earlier this year when residents of the Huon and Channel and Bruny Island had to live through a hellish summer period. They had diseased stinking and rotting fish washing up on their shorelines that are usually beautifully clear. The government's report into the event laid bare multiple failures of leadership and coordination between agencies, the effects on workers in the industry and their entirely inadequate response plan to deal with thousands of tonnes of dead fish. 

The report did highlight communication breakdown between agencies, government and the community, and none of that is a surprise to the Greens. We were at beach meetings where thousands of people stood talking about their experiences, and we heard from them. No one in the government had bothered to tell them that the diseased fish carcasses and fat balls that their dogs were eating could have contained antibiotics. There was no information available to them about which companies were doing the clean-up.

The report peddled the myth that salmon companies communicated accurately and openly with the community, but we heard stories from people who saw obvious salmon staff clearing the beaches at Verona Sands and Randalls Bay, trying to clean up the mess, who were clearly identified with the company but refused to say who they worked for. It was only after public pressure and the immense scale of the disaster that Huon Aquaculture admitted it was their own workers.

Locals saw Eric Abetz and Janie Finley actively supporting the companies that caused the disaster, but they were nowhere to be seen on the beaches, talking to their own constituents and communities. Nine months on and there haven't been any penalties applied to Huon or Tassal for what they did. Two mega multinational corporations who continue to operate as they wish in public waters on increasing scale with Liberal government agencies constantly running interference for them.

In March, the Greens called for a parliamentary inquiry into the summer mass mortality to get some real answers and to make sure there was change to prevent this happening again. But the Liberals and Labor Party stood together and voted it down.

Following that, the community group Neighbours of Fish Farms, who are truly on the frontline of that disaster, put forward a petition backing our calls for an investigation. Today, I tabled that petition that had nearly 2000 signatures of concerned locals. They want answers, they want changes.

Yesterday's weak response from the government to what happened doesn't pass their sniff test. The NRE's report failed to identify the cause of why the disease spread across biosecurity zones. It didn't acknowledge the salmonoid biosecurity program that was designed by the industry failed spectacularly and it resulted itself in the spread of Piscirickettsia salmonis between biosecurity zones. 

However, most outrageously, the report yesterday didn't offer any solutions to prevent it happening again this summer. The actions that we need to prevent disease spread is for companies to de-stock pens, to fallow them, or to remove them altogether from diseased areas. The only course of action that the government is proposing is to fast track a new antibiotic to dose up fish in the hope they will survive long enough to get them to market. They're looking to Chile as best practise country for solutions. It is a sick joke to propose a country that has a notorious global record for salmon industry collapse, widespread Piscirickettsia salmonis disease among salmon, plummeting numbers of wild fish populations and local fishing communities that have been devastated by the loss of wild fish catch. The future for Tasmania under the Liberals, backed by Labor, is writ large in what has happened to Chile's wild coast.

The Greens and Tasmanian coastal communities won't stand for it. We won't accept this toothless report as an adequate response. We won't accept our coastlines being trashed so that companies in Brazil and Canada can profit.

The House adjourned at 7.42 p.m.
