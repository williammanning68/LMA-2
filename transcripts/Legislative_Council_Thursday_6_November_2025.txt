ANSWER TO QUESTION

Bruny Island Bushfires

[11.05 a.m.]
Mr DUIGAN (Windermere - Minister for Parks) - Mr President, as committed to yesterday, I rise to provide information to the member for Hobart in relation to fires on south Bruny Island.

In answer to the first question, which was whether the Parks and Wildlife Service established how the fires started, I'm advised the PWS compliance team is currently undertaking an investigation into the cause of the bushfire. I'm told three different ignitions were observed and photographed from afar on the evening of Thursday 30 October near the northern end of the Labillardiere Peninsula. Labillardiere Peninsula, as I'm informed. I wasn't aware of it. With the absence of any prior lightning in the area, an investigation is being undertaken to determine the cause.

The second question was whether a fuel-reduction burn had been planned in this location in months to come and was lit early because of the original fire. The peninsula had been identified for fuel-reduction burning within the next five years due to its fuel loads and the time since a fire. This plan did not progress into the next 12-month window for values assessments. I am advised there is an approved burn area closer to the Jetty Beach campground that has been postponed due to swift parrot habitat.

There is one effective firebreak that runs across the peninsula. This firebreak was used to anchor backburning operations to contain the fire, given the elevated fire weather forecast over the weekend. I am advised this tactic was effective and proved successful to contain the fire to the peninsula and limit any movement toward the lighthouse in Jetty Beach under warmer northerly conditions, which were experienced on Sunday.

The third question was about how much of the peninsula was burnt by the original fires, and how much by the subsequent parks burn. I am told that the elevated fire weather over the weekend and the ignition and backburn fires linked up as expected, and that makes it difficult to attribute the resulting burn areas for each fire.

The peninsula had not been burned for over 40 years, and with elevated fuel loads, limited water resources and few escape routes, direct attack on the bushfire was not safe nor practical. Utilising only the firebreak across the peninsula was the best option to contain the bushfire.

I understand an aerial reconnaissance on Monday revealed approximately 750 hectares of the peninsula has now burned out. I believe the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service (PWS) continued to monitor the fire earlier this week, to survey impacts on values and to deal with the remaining hotspots.

The fourth question was about what natural values have been impacted by the bushfire. I understand significant work was undertaken by two bucketing aircraft helicopters to protect seabird colonies during the bushfire. Staff are planning to undertake an acoustic assessment of swift parrots starting later this week. Fortunately, on initial assessment, it appears that the flowering blue gums have not suffered too much scorch. However, more assessments are planned in the coming week.

DANGEROUS CRIMINALS AND HIGH RISK OFFENDERS AMENDMENT BILL 2025 (No. 46)

Second Reading

Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move - 

That the bill be now read the second time.

The amendments contained in this bill are the same as those that are included in the Dangerous Criminals and High Risk Offenders Amendment Bill of 2025 that the minister for Justice introduced into parliament earlier this year, but which lapsed with the calling of the 2025 Tasmanian state election.

This bill makes several amendments to the Dangerous Criminals and High Risk Offenders Act 2021 in relation to the making and operation of high-risk offender orders. The act commenced in December 2021 and provided for the Supreme Court to make dangerous criminal declarations or high-risk offender (HRO) orders in relation to certain offenders, following an application from the Director of Public Prosecutions.

Dangerous criminal declarations have the effect of detaining an offender in custody indefinitely after all their relevant custodial sentences have expired, subject to regular reviews by the court to determine if the declaration remains necessary. Dangerous criminal provisions were previously contained in the Sentencing Act 1997, but they were repealed so that updated and improved provisions could be included in the new standalone legislation.

The Dangerous Criminals and High Risk Offenders Act also introduced a second-tier scheme for high-risk offenders to provide for post-sentence supervision for serious sex offenders or violent offenders in the community, subject to various conditions imposed through an HRO. This second-tier scheme applies to serious offenders who do not meet the threshold for indefinite detention, but who are nevertheless considered to pose an unacceptable risk of committing another serious offence unless they are made subject to an HRO order. HRO orders may also operate as a step-down mechanism for the court to consider when reviewing a dangerous criminal declaration. An HRO order may be made for a period of up to five years. It is possible for the DPP to apply for a further HRO order to enable continued supervision beyond the period of an initial order.

An interim HRO order may be made in circumstances where the DPP has applied for an HRO order, but it appears to the court that the application will not be determined before the offender has been released from custody or made subject to the HRO order. An interim HRO order may not be less than three months or more than six months in duration unless the court considers that a longer operational period is warranted. The amendments in this bill only apply to the HRO order provisions of the act and not to the dangerous criminal declarations.

I will now outline the key clauses in the bill: inclusion of attempted crimes as serious offences. Schedule 1 of the act lists those offences that are considered to be serious offences for purposes of the act. The term, 'serious offence' is defined in section 3 and appears throughout part 3 of the act in relation to HRO orders. In particular, the term is used in section 24 to define who is a relevant offender, which in turn determines whether an application for an HRO order can be made in relation to that person.

Clause 4 of the bill replaces the current definition of 'serious offence' with an expanded definition that includes an offence of attempting to commit an offence against a provision listed in schedule 1. This means that where an offender has been convicted for attempting one of these crimes, they may be considered eligible for an HRO order application by the DPP. This amendment addresses the current gap where, for example, a person could be considered eligible for an HRO order on the basis of having been convicted of murder, but not on the basis of having been convicted of attempted murder, where the intent to commit a violent act may be indistinguishable regardless of the outcome.

Another example would be where an offender has been convicted of multiple attempted rapes over a period of time, but because the sexual act was never completed in any of those attempts, the offender would not have committed a serious offence for purposes of the act and could not be considered for an HRO order based on that offending alone.

While this amendment slightly broadens the range of offenders who may be considered for an HRO order, it remains at the discretion of the DPP to decide whether to apply for an order in relation to any particular offender based on their individual circumstances and risk profile.

Limited period of detention to facilitate arrangements for an HRO order. Clause 5 of the bill inserts a new subsection 4 into section 35 of the act to provide that when making an HRO order, the court may order that the offender is detained for a period of not more than seven days beyond the day on which they would cease to be in custody, if it is satisfied that such a period of time is required to make arrangements to give effect to the conditions imposed under the order. Related amendments concerning the issue of a warrant of committal are also included through the insertion of new subsections 5 and 6 to ensure that any extended period of detention is properly authorised. These amendments mirror the existing provisions in section 37 of the act that apply to interim HRO orders.
 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=3.6_D=27.2_C=0.82] 
 [Bookmark: _Hlk213333318] Like section 37, the amendments are designed to facilitate the successful release from custody of persons subject to HRO orders so as to avoid a lack of suitable arrangement leading to a breach of conditions. It is important to note that this limiACted extension of the detention period may only be granted where the court considers it is necessary.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.2_D=1.8_C=0.83] It will not occur by default or  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=33.4_D=2.7_C=0.91]  simply as a matter of course.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=36.8_D=30.0_C=0.83] Clarification regarding operational period of HRO orders. I now turn to clause 6 of the bill which amends section 39 of the act. Under section 39, an HRO order or interim HRO order is suspended when the offender who is subject to that order is in lawful custody; for example, if they are remanded in custody when charged with a crime or sentenced to a custodial  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=66.9_D=1.3_C=0.25] term. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=73.1_D=16.6_C=0.91]  Suspension means that the order remains in place but the obligations under that order, such as reporting to a probation officer or residing at certain premises, are suspended. This ensures that an offender is not found in breach of the conditions  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=90.1_D=7.8_C=0.88] of their order simply because they are physically unable to meet those conditions due to being held in custody.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=100.3_D=29.4_C=0.86] Interim HRO orders are not normally made for a period of more than six months. Section 39(5) provides that if an interim HRO order is suspended for a period, the operational period is extended by the period. This means that if an offender subject to an interim HRO order is placed in custody, time stops running for the order and then resumes again when the order is  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=129.8_D=0.9_C=0.13] released.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=131.5_D=26.1_C=0.82] This ensures that the relatively short duration of an interim HRO order does not completely expire during any custodial period. Subsection (5) was intentionally drafted to apply only to interim HRO orders and not HRO orders which may have an operational period of up to five years.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=158.0_D=2.7_C=0.67] When an offender subject to an HRO order  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=161.2_D=13.2_C=0.89] is placed in lawful custody their obligations under the order are suspended, but the time period of the order continues to run. Despite this deliberate drafting  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=174.9_D=7.6_C=0.80] questions were raised within the Department of Justice around the desirability or explicitly  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=186.4_D=16.8_C=0.81] reflecting this intention in the act. For the removal of any doubt, clause 6 of the bill inserts a new subsection (5A) into section 39 of the act to make this clear and unambiguous.  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=205.1_D=27.7_C=0.83] I note that this is not a change of policy but rather confirms the policy intent when the act was originally passed by the parliament and reflects a distinction between HRO orders and interim HRO orders. The HRO order provisions are premised on the court being able to satisfy itself in relation to the risk profile the offender at the time the court makes the order.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=233.2_D=25.1_C=0.82] If section 39(5) were to apply to HRO orders as well as interim HRO orders, it could potentially extend the HRO orders operational period and its obligations on the offender well beyond what the court considered appropriate at the time the order was made.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=258.6_D=4.7_C=0.88] Inclusion of additional offences relating to children and young persons  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=263.8_D=15.5_C=0.83] as serious offences. Finally, I turn to clause 7 of the bill, which expands the list of serious offences within Schedule 1 to the act to include 18 additional offences relating to children  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=279.4_D=1.6_C=0.81] and young persons.  [Bookmark: Phr22_O=283.1_D=14.1_C=0.88] This will enable an offender who has been convicted of one or more of these offences to be considered for a risk assessment by the High Risk Offenders Assessment Committee and for the DPP  [Bookmark: Phr23_O=297.9_D=7.1_C=0.84] to apply for an HRO order in relation to such offenders, provided that they meet the other requirements of being a relevant offender as set out in section 24 of the act. This change delivers on the 2024 election commitment to ensure that child sexual offenders can be assessed for the risk that they pose to the community and the need for monitoring through an HRO order.

With the expansion to the definition of serious offence to include attempts, this reform will broaden the range of offenders who may potentially be made subject to an HRO order. However, whether a risk assessment is undertaken in relation to a particular offender will remain for determination by the risk assessment committee.

Similarly, whether an application for an HRO order is ultimately made in relation to a particular offender will remain at the discretion of the DPP. It is also important to note that none of the amendments in this bill make any change to the statutory test the Supreme Court applies under section 35(2) of the act in deciding whether to make an HRO order, nor do they change the matters that the court under section 36 must have regard to in making that decision.

The minister would like to thank all of the stakeholders who provided feedback during the development of this bill and the public consultation process. That feedback is always considered carefully and is an important part of improving and updating Tasmania's legislation. I commend the bill to the House.

[12.27 p.m.]
Ms ARMITAGE (Launceston) - Mr President, I thank the Leader for bringing forward this important bill, and have some remarks to make. The Dangerous Criminals and High Risk Offenders Act 2021 marked an important legislative change to the way in which offenders who are considered to pose an unacceptable risk of committing another serious offence are dealt with by our justice system.

It is considered to be a strong legislative tool because it poses conditions on a person even after their custodial sentences have expired. The act essentially filled in the gap which existed in some cases where a person has done their time but nonetheless exhibited characteristics that show sufficient evidence to place additional requirements on them after they're released into the community. In cases of violent offences, especially those related to domestic and family violence, this was an important step forward.

Since the principal act came into force a number of years ago, it's to be expected that further ongoing changes need to be made to ensure that the act remains up to date, effective and in line with community expectations, and this is one of those bills.

One of these changes is that it is to now include attempted crimes as serious offences, effectively expanding the definition of a serious offence in the act to include attempting to commit an offence against a provision listed in schedule one.

Given the examples used by the Leader during her second reading contribution, this is a small change that would potentially have a significant effect, and it's an important change to implement in the act.

Additionally, this bill also seeks to insert a new subsection into section 35 of the act to provide that when making an HRO order, the court may order that the offender is detained for a period of not more than seven days beyond the day on which they would seek to be in custody if it satisfied that such a period of time is required to make arrangements to give effect to the conditions opposed under the order.

This is a reasonably significant section as it effectively imposes additional days in custody that's not in relation to having committed an offence. As such, seven days should be the absolute maximum and that it would be expected that this provision be used sparingly and as a last resort.

I note the Leader said this limited extension of a detention period may only be granted where the court considers it to be necessary, so I would appreciate a little more information on the types of scenarios where it's envisaged that this provision will be used.

The bill also contains a provision regarding the operational period of HRO orders, for example, where a person subject to an HRO order is placed in lawful custody, such as being placed in remand or sentenced to a custodial term, the HRO would be suspended under this provision. This frees up the person subject to the order from its obligations, such as reporting to a probation officer or residing at certain premises.

This is one of those commonsense provisions. I understand the necessity to legislate it to ensure that the act is clear on the matter. I note that this relates to interim HROs and not HROs themselves, the former of which can be put in place for six months and the latter for up to five years.

As the leader pointed out, if a person subject to an HRO, not an interim order, is placed into lawful custody, their obligations under the order are suspended, but the time period continues to run. I understand this is a deliberate drafting because regular HROs could potentially be extended well past what the court considered to be appropriate when the original order was made, which may have been years earlier.

Finally, and importantly, the bill seeks to include additional offences relating to children and young persons as serious offences. This will expand the list of serious offences within schedule 1 to include 18 additional offences relating to children and young persons and will enable an offender who's been convicted of any of these offences to be considered for risk assessment for an HRO.

We know from the commission of inquiry just how serious and devastating offences committed against children and young persons can be. An obligation was placed on us to ensure that we do everything within our power to keep people who have demonstrated characteristics of harming children and young persons away from them. This sort of pre-emptive action is very much justified in my opinion. I believe that the community would expect this and that, as a matter of policy, it is necessary to legislate, and this is an appropriate way to do it.

This bill addresses a very serious subject. I understand the need to balance the relevant rights and obligations of people subject to HROs and those of victim/survivors of relevant offences. It can be difficult to strike an appropriate balance. I know that the stakeholders who have provided input into the development of this bill have given a part of themselves to it. I hope that these changes reflect community expectations and will make a difference in the effective rehabilitation of offenders and the prevention of crime. I support the bill.

[12.33 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I just want to acknowledge the contribution from the member for Launceston. Sometimes when there aren't many contributions to something, it just shows that the second reading speech that has been prepared by the department has all the information. I want to acknowledge that in that contribution. It was excellent.

The member for Launceston requested a couple of examples. One is when an offender is required to be subjected to electronic monitoring, but the device is not available, which could be for a number of reasons. Another would be when an offender must reside at a particular place but more time is needed to confirm accommodation. I have been on a number of committees where there has been a lot of discussion about people released from custody, particularly long-term custody, having difficulty in finding appropriate accommodation, so that may well also be an issue. Obviously, it is always at the court's discretion. I trust that assists the honourable member.

Ms Armitage - It does, thank you.

Clause 4 agreed to.

Clause 5 -
Section 35 amended (HRO orders)

Ms WEBB - Madam Chair, I rise to  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=150.3_D=5.7_C=0.65] ask a question about this clause in relation to  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=157.2_D=29.4_C=0.75] (4)(a), which is talking about the seven-days matter. This was covered briefly in the second reading speech and in the member for Launceston's contribution, which pointed out some concerning elements to it. For whatever reason, I missed the call getting up and did not make a second reading contribution, so I just wanted to ask you a question here in relation to it. 

I note that in submissions made on this bill and that in further correspondence to some members,  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=187.9_D=28.8_C=0.81] there were significant concerns from the Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service about aspects of this bill. This element of the bill was one of those areas of concern. Their concern was that the proposal to allow seven days of detention post sentence to finalise the order may appear administratively convenient; however, from a rights-based and cultural perspective it represents an expansion of custodial authority that may be viewed as a superfluous use of custodial settings and impingement on  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=216.8_D=29.7_C=0.79] the individual's rights.

Something that came up in briefings was TALS' assertion that the onus to progress arrangements for the post-release HRO conditions and have them ready should be on the government and the department, rather than there be a further impingement of custodial time on the person in question. So on the record here, I would like to have  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=246.9_D=1.3_C=0.82] some comments from the government  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=249.0_D=29.7_C=0.84] in a broad sense about why that onus shouldn't sit prior to release and extra time be given in the timelines utilised prior to release, rather than post-release imposing on the person. 

I would also particularly like there to be information put onto the record here about how the cultural aspects and their impacts on the Tasmanian Aboriginal community have been taken into account, and what response was made by the government  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=279.1_D=7.4_C=0.87] in relation to these matters raised by the Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service. It appears there wasn't a response, so I would like the government to  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=287.1_D=8.8_C=0.90] clarify and put on the record: did they respond to these concerns? Did they respond to the Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service about it? If so, what was that response?

Ms RATTRAY - Mr President, I appreciate everyone's patience. I thank the member for the questions. I have quite a lengthy answer. It will be useful to have that on the public record.

The government acknowledges that post-sentence detention for any period of time should only be used in exceptional circumstances, and that is why the proposed amendment guards against misuse by requiring the Supreme Court to be satisfied that the extra period of detention is necessary in order to enable arrangements to be made to give effect to the HRO order conditions; the court will not approve the additional detention unless it is so satisfied. We gave those couple of examples of what might cause a potential delay. 

It's also important to understand that delays to arrangements being put in place, in order to give effect to the conditions imposed under the HRO order, may not necessarily be attributed to, or be within the full control of the state. Noting that the paramount consideration of the court in making an HRO order is the safety of the community, it is reasonable that time be extended by a short period, if required, to ensure that critical objective is met. If the court has already determined the HRO conditions are necessary to protect the community upon release of the offender, the objectives of the act would not be met if the offender was released without the ability to properly monitor or enforce those conditions. 

I've also got some information in regard to the process: Community Corrections takes an individualised case-management approach in working with each offender. Where an offender has a close connection to country and community this will help guide assessments and intervention approaches. Connection to culture can be a key framework guiding recommendations to the court and supporting decisions around any relevant order conditions, to ensure offenders are afforded opportunities to engage in culturally meaningful activities. Generally, community corrections will work with an individual support network to ensure the work undertaken to support them and address their criminogenic risks and needs is tailored and appropriate. Where a person has an existing connection to their community this will help frame and guide practice. Where a person identifies that establishing a stronger connection to their community is an important outcome for them, officers will work with the person to build relevant and meaningful connections to achieve this outcome.

I have some information on the DPP about those nine months versus the suggested possibly 10-month period, a longer period, at the front-end and not extending at the back-end. Section 33 of the act already provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions may apply for an HRO order up to nine months before the date on which the offender would otherwise be released without conditions. This timeframe is considered appropriate and sufficient. The capacity to conduct assessments of offenders, obtain reports and progress matters through the court system may vary considerably based on the individual offender and the complexity of their specific circumstances and background. Delays may be caused by the offender refusing to cooperate in the preparation of risk assessments and behavioural and management reports. The timing of proceedings may also be impacted by the general management of court business and availability of council on both sides. All those matters may be beyond the DPP's control. Considering those variables, it would be inappropriate and unrealistic to burden the DPP with specific timeframes for service and lodgement within the nine-month period during which an application may be made.

The government believes that in all the circumstances, an extension of up to seven days of detention is not disproportionate or unreasonable, particularly considering that any offender who warrants the making of an HRO order is extremely likely to have been serving lengthy custodial sentences for committing serious crimes. Given that the ability already exists for the supreme court to order such an extension for interim HRO orders, there is no logical or compelling reason to deny such a discretion in relation to non-interim HRO orders if the court is satisfied it is warranted.

I believe a final response to the member's questions that were raised. The suggestion that the time for making applications for HRO orders should be extended from nine months to 10 months does not reflect that the nature of each offender's case will be different and involve different considerations. It is only towards the end of the process when the court determines which particular conditions should be imposed. Additional time at the beginning will not assist in this process. I note there is no evidence to suggest that the nine-month period is in fact insufficient. The proposed amendments are only to ensure there is a mechanism available in the highly unlikely situation there may be difficulty in ensuring all the courting pros conditions can be met. The comparable provisions for the interim HRO orders have never been used yet.

I trust that that has answered some of the concerns.

[12.49 p.m.]
Ms WEBB - Madam Chair, I appreciate that level of detail being provided. Thank you to the Leader and the those supporting her. I want to pick up on a couple of them and seek some more response on the record if that is okay.

The government statement regarding nine months is sufficient and then goes on to make a whole lot of comments about why that might not be long enough and why we might potentially run out of time because of the uncertainty of the elements that have to occur during that time.

It wasn't on the record that I mentioned the possibility of extending it at the top front end to 10 months. We talked about that in a briefing. It is a different conversation, but things said in a briefing probably shouldn't be brought to the floor unless the member brings it to the floor. But anyway, I still would regard if the expectation is that the whole process is aimed to finish prior to the release date, then that is the thing that reduces the likelihood that it needs to be extended. The idea of setting an appropriate amount of time that allows the uncertainty and builds in for the uncertainty of the different elements of the process, such that it does it completed prior to the planned release date is not an unreasonable one. That is where the onus should sit.

My concern is seven days, is again just a spurious number plucked out of the air, presumably to look not too serious. It is only a week. They've been in jail for years is the gist of the answer that was provided there. They're long sentences and another week's not going to hurt. Actually, it does hurt in a human rights sense, because a sentence that's been given as punishment is a sentence that's been given as punishment by the court. When we start to say, 'well, an extra week' next thing we might come back here and be saying, look, actually that wasn't quite right. We've had to do it a few times now. We'll actually need an extra 15 days maybe. My concern is as soon as you start to contravene that principle, it opens the door.

Again, there's inconsistency there from the government in terms of saying 9 months is sufficient from the time that the order can be applied for through the release date. Then the government says actually it's hard to get things done potentially in that time and we might run out of time, so we'll just give ourselves an extra week. That is an inconsistency that the government hasn't properly -

Madam CHAIR - Can I remind the member -

Ms WEBB - I will get to a question.

Madam CHAIR - This is not an opportunity for a second-reading-speech-like contribution. If you can focus on the questions you have.

Ms WEBB - I will get to a question. My question is going to be on how is this going to be reported on? In terms of annual reports and that sort of thing, will it be clearly indicated when, for example, any element of extra time up to the seven days has been taken to have somebody released under an order of this sort so we can track clearly in an ongoing way and scrutinise the use of this provision? I want to understand that.

Will the reasons for the delay be reported? Clearly what's at risk here is that people experiencing disadvantage are particularly vulnerable to this being applied to them. Whether that's because they're homeless, because they're in poverty or they don't have sufficient supports around them. When they go out in order for conditions to be put into effect, will those things, whatever the nature of the impediment that caused the extra days to be applied to them, will that be reported on too?

Ms RATTRAY - Madam Chair, the records that the member has asked about will be held by the courts. There are currently no plans to publish this information, but it would be available if a request was made.

Ms Webb - We don't have an annual reporting of HRO orders?

Ms RATTRAY - This information would be held by the Supreme Court.

Ms Webb - The data - I'm just talking about the data.

Ms RATTRAY - I'm advised that there would be reporting of the data, but not specific information around every case.

Ms Webb - I am just asking if there's an indication of, when this is brought into play, if there will be data about - not personal details, obviously not identifying details - will there be data about how often -

Madam CHAIR - Order. The Leader can answer the question. If she can't, we might -

Ms Webb - I am just trying to clarify the question without taking my final call.

Madam CHAIR - We'll see if the Leader can find some more information.

Ms RATTRAY - I'll attempt to find any additional information.

I'm advised that the data would be available, but it wouldn't be reported at that level of detail in regard to this matter.

Ms WEBB - Madam Chair, my last call. I find it interesting that in no-one's annual report is data provided about how many HRO applications there have been - or completed ones. That's astonishing.

The other part of my question from when I rose for the first time was about engagement with the Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service. I appreciated the answer provided about the ways that Community Corrections engages with people who have connection to Country and culture. However, my question was specific to the Aboriginal Legal Service's submission that raised certain issues. I do not believe that was responded to. I asked if the government had engaged with them, if they have, what was the nature of that, and if they haven't, why not?

Sitting suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.
