RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

The SPEAKER - Could members welcome in the gallery the year 9 students from The Hutchins School. Is that right? Yes. You are out of uniform and I do not quite know what to do. Thank you for joining us.

Members - Hear, hear.


QUESTIONS

Budget 2025-26 - Tasmania's Credit Rating

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.02 a.m.]
You have given up trying to manage the budget responsibly. You are sending Tasmania broke. Amid the many damaging critiques of your Budget, economist Saul Eslake said, 'There must now be significant risks that Moody's and Standard and Poor's, who have already moved Tasmania to a negative outlook, will further downgrade Tasmania's credit rating.' Can you guarantee Tasmania's credit rating will not be further downgraded as a result of your budget mismanagement?

ANSWER
 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=277.8_D=2.8_C=0.31]  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=284.6_D=15.2_C=0.76] 
Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. Our Budget is about building a better Tasmania now and for the future, and keeping our economy strong. We have a $40 billion economy record low unemployment of 3.8 per cent, keeping people gainfully employed in work, and also increasing our participation by investing in key training programs. These include the Earthworks Academy and the renewable energy training centre on the north-west coast. We have upgraded TAFE buildings across the state; nursing; and the Water Centre of Excellence. We are investing in training so people can participate in a growing economy where we continue to invest in key infrastructure - $30 billion of infrastructure over the next 10 years.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=46.0_D=26.1_C=0.83] I am very pleased that we have been able to outline continued investment in infrastructure, training, health, education, community safety and housing, and addressing the pressures of cost of living, as we have done.

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. This is particularly about the credit rating. I am asking you to bring the Premier back to the question.

The SPEAKER - The question did not have much of a  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=74.0_D=10.5_C=0.53] preamble and was specifically about the potential for a credit rating downgrade. I will draw the Premier to the question.
Mr ROCKLIFF  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=84.9_D=20.6_C=0.73] - We are about ensuring that we have a strong pathway to surplus and ensuring that - 

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - There is none. Where?

Mr ROCKLIFF - You get the opportunity today. Can the member guarantee that there will be an alternative budget today? 

Members interjecting.

Mr WINTER - Point of order, honourable Speaker, back to  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=110.3_D=16.6_C=0.57] Standing Order 45, relevance. The Premier is now wilfully not listening to your direction. He should be brought back to relevance to the question.

The SPEAKER - Premier, I have asked you to be relevant to the question. If you feel that you have answered the question and do not wish to say anything else that is relevant, you may resume your seat. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you. I will [Bookmark: Phr8_O=127.5_D=13.9_C=0.64] , of course, come to the nub of the question, of course.

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - This is so serious, and yet you are a joke.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Okay, well, we will look forward to your alternative budget.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER -  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=141.4_D=5.8_C=0.63] Members on my left, if the Premier is going to be relevant, I will need you to stop interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Dr Broad, [Bookmark: Phr10_O=148.8_D=19.0_C=0.85]  the champ, was the one who last produced a set of figures and I commend him for that. There were 11 mistakes, which we had to have a re-run with, but at least there was a document with numbers in it. With all of the mistakes that were contained within - 

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the not-unexpected supplementary. 

Mr WINTER - The Premier did not even go near the question. In his answer, he refused to even address it. He refused to guarantee that his budget mess would not lead to a credit downgrade. Can he therefore outline to the House what the result of a downgrade would be in terms of increased interest repayments on the already $650 million Tasmanians will be paying per year just to service the debt?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I can make this ruling all by myself. I will call the Premier to the question because the original question was not addressed. The  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=198.0_D=1.0_C=0.79]  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=200.8_D=6.7_C=0.83]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=208.0_D=2.4_C=0.75] further step of that is a matter for the Premier to address.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The new fiscal conservative in the parliament, it would seem. When he talks to the business community it is very different indeed from when he talks to the unions.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - When I allow supplementary questions, I do not expect interjections. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - S&P rates Tasmania's credit rating at AA+. Moody's rates Tasmania's credit rating at Aa2. The recent releases were notes [Bookmark: Phr17_O=245.9_D=8.6_C=0.74]  post the release of the 2025-26 Budget and there was no rating action as part of either note. Our economy remains strong [Bookmark: Phr18_O=254.8_D=10.6_C=0.69] , of course. Our Budget provides record investment in health and education. 

What I am detecting from those opposite is they want to cut health, schools [Bookmark: Phr19_O=267.3_D=19.3_C=0.64]  and community safety, and not invest in housing.

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - You want to send us broke. 

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That is what I am hearing. That will have an impact on the economy but, most importantly, also have an impact on those essential services that Tasmanians care about.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. It would be helpful for all if interjections ceased. 


Budget 2025-26 - Tasmania's Credit Rating

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.07 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=288.9_D=13.8_C=0.74] You have given up on our budget, given up on managing our budget responsibly. You are sending Tasmania broke -

Members interjecting.
The SPEAKER - The only voice I should be hearing is that of the Leader of the Opposition.

Mr WINTER -  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=303.5_D=1.5_C=0.70] and now S&P has confirmed it is considering downgrading Tasmania's credit rating. This would push the interest bill on our record debt even higher. Do you accept that a credit downgrade would be the ultimate indictment on your failed economic mismanagement? 

ANSWER 

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. What Tasmanians want is a growing economy that funds those essential services.

Members interjecting.

Ms Finlay - They are not going to get it from you.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass, the Premier is 10 seconds in.

Mr ROCKLIFF - When it comes to borrowing costs, the two interest rate decreases we have seen may also flow into borrowing costs as well. We have welcomed and been calling for this, because Tasmanians have been hit hard by -

Mr Winter - You know this budget goes for more than one year, do you not?

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - increased interest rises over the course of the last number of months and years.

Ms Dow - Hit hard by your government for 11 years.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

Mr Willie - Your debt is spiralling out of control.

The SPEAKER - Shadow treasurer.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The RBA decision certainly plays a very big role in borrowing costs. That is why we need to be very mindful of our pathway to operating surplus in 2029-30 -

Mr Winter - There is none.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you very much, and cash surplus following that - may well be sooner, depending on other matters around the Efficiency and Productivity Unit (EPU) and finding efficiencies and potential asset sales as well.
What would not do, which I am assuming the member is alluding to, is cut essential services or increase taxes -

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - You said you are going to cut two-and-a-half thousand jobs.

Mr ROCKLIFF - which is the Labor Leader's plan until he says it is not.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We could easily return to surplus, as we have said over the last week, if we cut that $10 million a day health expenditure to $7 million, but that has been done before and it did not work, and it devastated many Tasmanians all that time ago.

Mr Winter - You are just a joke. You are a lame duck. Premier for one more year.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have a sensible pathway to surplus.

Mr Winter - No you do not. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - We are investing in the areas that Tasmanians care about. You can flap your hands all you like but you need to have an alternative. You cannot get up there and one minute say, 'You must be investing in this', and the next minute say, 'The debt is too big.' 

Members interjecting.

Ms Ogilvie - Moaning. More moaning.

The SPEAKER - Minister Ogilvie.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have a measured response - a sensible pathway to surplus which reflects the challenging global economic times felt in this nation and felt by every other state and territory of Australia.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - In his answer, the Premier talked about 'a sensible pathway to surplus.' Can he name the year in which the debt will stop growing?

The SPEAKER - I will call the Premier because it arises from the answer that he gave.

Mr Winter - Just name a year. 

The SPEAKER - You got the supplementary question. That will do.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the member for the question. Net operating surplus 2029-30; a cash surplus following that.

Mr Winter - Which year?

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Oh, heavens above.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We could have that sooner, though, depending on asset sales and all the work of the EPU in ensuring we get that right-size public service.

Mr Winter - So that is the plan?

Mr ROCKLIFF - What is important is that we do not constrict the economy unnecessarily by mass sackings of public servants, which has been done in the past and did not work.

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - You are proposing 2500 in this Budget.

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question was what year will the debt stop increasing? 

The SPEAKER - The Premier already concluded his -

Members interjecting.

Ms Finlay - Does he know the answer?

The SPEAKER - No, thank you. You do not get to stand up, make a point of order and make allegations like that. You can have a question if you are granted one by your Leader.


Aboriginal Tasmanians - Treaty

Mr BAYLEY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.12 a.m.]
You were at the reconciliation breakfast this morning where Uncle Jim Everett -puralia meenamatta and Aunty Theresa Sainty gave powerful speeches on behalf of their community. Both lamented the actions of your government destroying country and trashing treaty. Uncle Jim's message was resoundingly clear. He said, 'Don't give up on us. Put treaty back on the agenda.' At the request of community, he then walked out of the event to talk to them about how to get you to embrace a treaty.

Premier, your inaction shames us all. It is time to do the right thing, not roll over to the right wing. Given the community's demands, will you do as Uncle Jim has asked and put treaty back on the table?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. It was good to see the member at the breakfast, as well as the opposition leader, minister Petrusma, minister Jaensch, Mr Ferguson, and others, I am sure, were there.

A member - It was awesome.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It was awesome. It was very powerful, actually, some very good speakers and very honest, upfront, strong feelings from Theresa Sainty, Jim Everett, Dewayne Everettsmith , and others, which I listened to intently.

What we need to do, and what we are embarking on is also historic and significant when it comes to truth-telling and healing. It is significant. I understand the member's question about treaty, but we need to ensure that we have the truth-telling and healing process before we can come to other, more formal agreements. That is so important.

What the referendum demonstrated, in my personal view, was that we have not done enough when it comes to informing our community, educating community and supporting Tasmanian Aboriginal people to tell their story and tell their truth. That is why it was powerful today - powerful for me - to listen to that when I was invited on country at Wukalina last year, where we had a very robust and honest conversation with Tasmanian Aboriginal people. When I say robust, I am saying really robust - forthright and frank. I listened to that, and it is important to listen, and to hear - not just to listen, but to hear, as Theresa Sainty said today - and also ensure that one reflects and learns.

This is a learning journey when it comes to truth-telling and healing. It must come first before any potential formalised agreements. It will be Aboriginal-led, and then after truth-telling and healing, the next steps will also be Aboriginal-led.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - Honourable Speaker, a supplementary question?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr BAYLEY - The Premier said that he listened. One of the things that was said very clearly today was that truth-telling and healing was pointless if it had nowhere to go in the context of treaty. He also said that we have to do that first before more formal agreement. Is he here today saying that treaty is indeed not off the table, and that you will still consider it in the future, or have you ruled it out entirely?

The SPEAKER - I will allow the supplementary. I think it is a bit of a longbow, but I will allow the Premier to answer the question as he chooses.

Mr ROCKLIFF - As I say, further steps will be Aboriginal-led, but it is important that we embark on, in my view and the view of others, truth-telling and healing first.

First, I welcome and thank minister Petrusma for ensuring that throughout our budget process, Reconciliation Tasmania has a consistent four years of funding to provide that certainty to do their job well. I mention honourable Mrs Petrusma -

Mrs Petrusma - Thank you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - for that work, but also strong advocates for Reconciliation Tasmania across the parliament, in fact - Mr O'Byrne, Mr Garland, to name just a few.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Mr Rockliff - I am sorry.

The SPEAKER - I was distracted as well.


Homelessness - Code Blue Protocol for Extreme Weather Events

Mr O'BYRNE question to MINISTER for HOUSING and PLANNING, Mr ELLIS

[10.18 a.m.]
Sunday was the first day of winter, which makes life even harder for Tasmanians sleeping rough. Around the country, extreme weather response protocols for people sleeping rough ensure that agencies and the community sector are able to provide additional services to those in need. Under this model, homelessness services and the public are notified if code blue or code red conditions are reached, with services contacting all known rough sleepers to offer them support. In other states, code red and code blue responses are administered by state governments through public housing agencies. 

Since 2019, Tasmanian homelessness services and local councils have been asking for the state government to adopt a code blue system for extreme cold, but so far, we do not have one. With overnight temperatures to fall to 1° Celsius this week, can you explain why we do not yet have a code blue system in place to help rough sleepers in Tasmania during winter?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Franklin for his important question. Absolutely, we need to be supporting people who are sleeping rough through the winter months. It is a hard time of year and it is important that we have that support. I am happy to follow up for the member regarding the code blue protocols and seek some further advice on those matters.

More broadly, the investment that we have seen through this Budget is significant for housing and homelessness services. We are delivering an additional $45 million each and every year as part of our support for people who are sleeping rough, so that they can have the services and wrap-around support they need. It is even more than just a roof over their head. It is the people who are able to provide those important services.

More broadly, there is significant investment through the Budget and an additional $500 million to support the growth in housing supply, particularly for social and affordable housing. We want to increase the support that we are delivering for Tasmanians, taking action on the areas that are important to them: cost of living, health, housing and keeping the community safe. It is all about ensuring that we take action on the issues that matter. 

I am happy to follow up with the member on his important question and work closely with him regarding what those protocols might mean for delivering better services for Tasmanians doing it tough.

The SPEAKER - I note that we have a question taken on notice.


Budget 2025-26 - Jobs

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.12 a.m.]
In 2011, in this place, you said:

Tasmanians should not become the victims of financial mismanagement … It is not their fault that this incompetent Government has been irresponsible with taxpayers' dollars and has massively overspent in each of the last seven budgets.

The budget you presented on Thursday includes ten cash deficits in a row and no credible pathway to surplus.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my right.

Mr WINTER - By your own measure, do you lead an 'incompetent government that has been irresponsible with taxpayers' dollars'? Why should Tasmanians working in our health and education systems pay for your budget with their jobs?

Members interjecting.

Mrs Petrusma - Three thousand, one hundred and six.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Minister for Health.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the history lesson. I am sure there is a lot of trawling going on for the words that I have said ever since I have been in this place since August or September 2002. You found some from 2011, which pretty aptly described your government. I was pretty much on the money, I thought.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, members on both sides. I have a significant interest in how this question is being addressed.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I get the question. 

Ms Dow - That is good. That is a start.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You effectively framed it as, 'Do you remember how much of a crap government we were?' - yes, I do.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The Premier will be mindful of his language in the House. I am not sure that that is parliamentary language, Premier.

Mr O'Byrne - To be honest, I would take personal offence.

The SPEAKER - I do not know if I can from the Chair.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will take your guidance on that, honourable Speaker, but I do remember - and you talk about jobs and there were 10,000 jobs lost over -

Mr Winter - Seven thousand full-time jobs lost under you.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have created 40,000-plus jobs and a $40 billion economy. A great effort, as I said at the -

Ms Butler - Patting yourself on the back, are you not? 'Yeah, good on us.'

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, Ms Butler. A great effort, as I said, at the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) breakfast in Hobart, the lunch in Launceston, and the dinner in Ulverstone last week, where I commended Tasmanians for where we have come over the last decade. I deliberately said that this is not just about our government; this is about the small, medium and large businesses and the community organisations that have supported Tasmania to grow. You were there, Mr Winter. You would have heard me, so do not shake your head like that, please.

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - I am still getting over the Treasurer, actually.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Speaking of the TCCI: post-budget, they said businesses are very upbeat. We know that business confidence in Tasmania is strong.

Mr Winter - It will be hard to ever trust your government again. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - We know that businesses are looking forward to the coming years with a very robust Tasmanian economy. What is important in the Budget is there are a number of things there that will help to see our economy continue to grow. When you continue to grow, you continue to employ more people.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. I call the member for Clark, Ms Johnston, who is also the only voice I am now listening to.


Community Services - Government Funding

Ms JOHNSTON question to MINISTER for COMMUNITY SERVICES, Mr JAENSCH

[10.24 a.m.]
Your address to the Community Service Forum on Friday went down like a cup of cold sick.

Members interjecting.

Ms JOHNSTON - You effectively told them to be more efficient, effective and innovative with the pittance you fund them with. You also told them that if the government was not offering enough money to cover the cost of delivering these services, they should simply not accept the contract.

Community organisations work incredibly hard despite chronic underfunding. The government is betting they will continue to do this work, but they are exhausted; they cannot squeeze more out of nothing and they feel their commitment to Tasmania is being exploited. If these organisations refuse your un-workable contracts, are you proposing the government will deliver those services, or are you content to see Tasmanians who rely on those services go without?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. I do not understand her characterisation. When I was speaking with the Tasmanian Council of Social Service (TasCOSS) forum there, as I have with many or most of its members who were represented there, I recognised that the way that we contract services from community sector organisations is outdated, difficult, and inefficient for them and the government to run. That is why we are embarking on a program of reforming the way that we contract with our community service organisation partners, moving to longer-term contracts for services for recurrent service delivery, moving away from repeated short-term grants.

When we have an organisation like a peak body that has a role that is similar each year over a long period of time, it is not sensible for us to fund them through a fixed-term individual grant deed approach.

Mr Winter - You have been doing it for 11 years. What government do you think you are part of?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr JAENSCH - What we are moving to, which is what the sector has asked for, is longer-term funding agreements based on purchasing outcomes, giving the sector maximum opportunity to innovate -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, you did not ask the question. You will allow Ms Johnston to hear the answer.

Mr JAENSCH - in how they deliver those services with a focus on the outcomes, not the outputs. This is something that the sector has asked for. We are working with a series of 22 peak bodies right now on delivering so that, by the end of June this year, we will have a program for each of them to move into longer-term contracts. We will then move into a second tranche of longer-term contracting for organisations like our Neighbourhood Houses, which are receiving $15 million in this coming year under our Budget, so that they do not have the transaction costs tied up with repeated short-term funding agreements either.

This is what they wanted. This is what we want to deliver. It is more in line with the Treasurer's Instructions about how we use grants and how we use service agreements. I think it can yield significant efficiencies for both the community sector organisations and the government and taxpayers' money.

Every time someone has to write a grant application and has to provide an acquittal report against it, someone else has to read it. If that is the same thing again and again, year on year, there is -

Ms Finlay - It took you 11 years to figure that out. Unbelievable. You have just figured this out.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass, you seem to struggle, on a Tuesday, to stay in the room. Please cease your interjecting.

Mr JAENSCH - There is a lot of busy work involved in that, which is not necessarily directed at delivering better outcomes for the dollars invested.

Mr Winter - You are the busy work king.

Mr JAENSCH - We are on a journey with the community sector to modernise the way that we contract, for their benefit and for ours, and to get better outcomes for Tasmanians.

Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary from the member for Clark.

Ms JOHNSTON - The minister disagreed with the characterisation of the forum. Following on from his question - and I know a number of members in this place were at that forum, and did quite clearly hear him say that if services were not happy with the level of funding then they should not accept the contracts. Can you focus specifically on the question about whether services will still be delivered if the community service organisations can no longer deliver them, and whether the government will be doing that or whether you will be increasing funding?

The SPEAKER - I will draw the minister for community services to the original question and allow the supplementary.

Mr JAENSCH - The characterisation I was referring to was your comment on how my speech went down, which I do not agree with and do not think they were parliamentary terms either.

We are committed to modernising the way that we contract. We need to have something better than the systems we have had, where we have had fixed-term contracts on the same terms repeated again and again under a grants program.

Members interjecting.

Mr JAENSCH - What we need to be able to do is to have an outcomes-based agreement with organisations, where we agree on the outcomes and the cost of delivering them. 'Agreement' means a two-way street. We have to go eyeball to eyeball with them, understand the mission, understand the cost and lock it in, in ways that reduce transaction costs, administration and red tape, frankly, for the community sector organisations and our partnership with them.


Integrity Commission - Funding Commitment

Mr JENNER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.30 a.m.]
Last month I moved a motion calling on the government to commit more funding to the Integrity Commission - an integrity body that is, by national standards, one of the most poorly funded in the country. That motion was passed with your government's support. Yet, when I opened the budget papers on Thursday, I saw the funding to the Integrity Commission had not budged for this year and is expected to go down in the forward Estimates.

Is your government deliberately underfunding the Integrity Commission to avoid being held accountable? Can Tasmanians expect to see a fully funded Integrity Commission while your government is in office?

The SPEAKER - For those who may think that was a reflection on a vote of the House, I will point out that it was actually a commentary on a direction undertaken by the House, so it is in order.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question, and I know he has significant interest in this matter. The discussion that we had in the House was not too far away, so I recognise the member's commitment to this particular matter. There has been an increase in funding for the Integrity Commission, as I understand it, from last year to this year. From 2015, there has been 77 per cent increase in funding for the Integrity Commission. That is significant, in my view.

To your point: funding, of course, is important, but reform is important as well. The Cox review - we are working our way through the 55 recommendations. Six of the recommendations are now complete, addressing technical and other relatively straightforward matters, I am advised. Of course, further work has already been undertaken in considering the remaining recommendations and other suggested reforms, including consultation through the release of a discussion paper a few years ago. Our department is progressing amendments as a matter of priority, including those identified in Appendix A of the Integrity Commission's discussion paper.

Also, the Attorney-General looks forward to updating the House on progress in September of this year. I do not doubt this will also be a topic of discussion in budget Estimates when the funding is scrutinised more thoroughly in that particular forum, of which we are very happy to account for and discuss.


Budget 2025-26 - Macquarie Point Stadium Funding

Mr BAYLEY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.33 a.m.]
On Thursday, your Treasurer delivered one of Tasmania's worst ever budgets. Community organisations helping struggling Tasmanians remain underfunded. The public housing waitlist is now over 5000 people, but there is too little to credibly address that need. You have slashed funding to protect our environment despite massive pressures from climate change, corporate pollution and habitat destruction. Amid these crises, you are stubbornly funding a stadium that will inevitably cost well over a billion dollars. To accommodate your budget mess, you plan to cut thousands of public sector workers and have a fire sale of Tasmania's publicly owned assets, lands and businesses. This says everything about your government's warped priorities.

How do you look vulnerable Tasmanians in the eye? Will you not listen to them, put their desperate needs front and centre, and abandon a new stadium they do not want, do not need and cannot afford?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I am not sure I agree at all with the characterisation of the Budget by any stretch of the imagination, I would have to say. To the point with respect to Ms Johnston's question to minister Jaensch as well, on the funding of the community organisations - at the last election we committed to growth funding and indexation for our community organisations. In my view, we are the only party to do so. The Greens might have done. I know the Labor Party did not commit to that but we did. We have listened and understood the workforce pressures that the organisations are undergoing at this present time, and the difficulty to keep staff as well, because of the need to have that certainty of funding. The funding over the forward Estimates, in my understanding, will be higher than CPI to support the community organisations.

What is also crucial is moving towards five-year contracts, to provide that certainty but also allow organisations that support vulnerable Tasmanians to invest in people with confidence, to support Tasmanians. I learnt this when I was Mental Health and Wellbeing minister a few years ago where there was some uncertainty about organisations within the mental health sector and their inability to deliver, just as I said, in terms of workforce capacity and the like, on only one-year contracts. We moved them to three years, if my memory serves me correctly -

Members interjecting.

Mr Bayley - It is still not enough. They are still crying out for help.

Ms Haddad - You moved them back to one-year contracts.

The SPEAKER - Members for Clark, both of you - not you, Mr Willie.

Mr ROCKLIFF - which was welcomed. It is now five years, with growth funding above Consumer Price Index (CPI). Not only that, but we are investing in supporting vulnerable Tasmanians with half a billion dollars of concessions, including cost-of-living relief. Our renewable energy dividend is an example of that, a reform put in by our government supporting Tasmanians -

Mr Winter - A reform? You think that is a reform?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes, thank you very much. Thank you for acknowledging it, Mr Winter. A reform - a renewable energy dividend supporting Tasmanians, crediting the power bills for $60 more recently.

Mr Winter - It is a policy, mate.

Mr ROCKLIFF - There is a massive $14.5-billion investment into health, so we can cater for increasing demand. There is increasing demand across the globe and across this nation when it comes to health demand with our ageing population and the like. There is a $10 billion investment into education and children -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - Honourable Speaker, a supplementary question?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr BAYLEY - Notwithstanding all of those commitments the Premier made, the community service organisations are still crying out and claiming and talking about the services that they cannot deliver. He went nowhere near my question, which was actually about the stadium and why you do not abandon a stadium that we do not need or want and cannot afford, so that we can properly invest in those kind of services that Tasmania desperately needs.

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to the original question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You are once again mentioning the stadium infrastructure. The enabling legislation will go through, to the best of our ability, enabling infrastructure that will help grow the economy so we can fund these services that you care about. I know you care about it. I care about it as well.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - When it comes to community service organisations, we are providing indexation to the community sector of 3.5 per cent in 2024-25, 3 per cent over the following three years, together with longer term funding agreements and an outcome-based framework. This commitment to indexation will provide almost $26 million extra into the community services sector over the next four years. We have to invest in stadia and other infrastructure across the state, create the jobs and create the economy so we can fund these essential services.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. While Mrs Beswick is approaching, we can all wave goodbye to the grade 9 Hutchins students.


Budget 2025-26 - Eslake Report

Mrs BESWICK question to TREASURER, Mr BARNETT

[10.38 a.m.]
In August last year, economist Saul Eslake handed out a sobering report into the state's finances. He provided a blueprint for budget repair in the face of spiralling debt and deficit. At the time, your government argued there was not enough time to incorporate Mr Eslake's ideas into the September budget. This year, those excuses do not stack up. Why have you again ignored the advice of Mr Eslake, who says your Budget does nothing to forestall a further deterioration in Tasmania's financial position?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. In respect to the government's response to the Eslake report, the Budget is about building a better Tasmania now and for the future, investing in the things that matter like health, education, housing and cost of living. I believe we have the balance right and I am pleased with that. It has been great to be working and involved with business and community leaders on the Friday. I received their feedback, which is broadly positive. I am confident and positive about the Budget and the prospects for Tasmania -

Mr Winter - What did they say? They were laughing at you. They were giggling at the back.

Mr BARNETT - because we have a strong and growing economy - $40.6 billion. We have the highest wage growth in the country, the lowest unemployment on record and retail trade at record levels. There is confidence in there, in fact, higher than any other jurisdiction in Australia over the last several months, according to the National Australia Bank (NAB) Business Survey. I am pleased about that.

I thank the honourable Mr Eslake for his Independent Review of Tasmania's State Finances. I also thank him for his work on government business enterprise reform, which is the biggest reform of our government businesses in more than 30 years. We appreciate that report. We have acted on it and accepted those recommendations. 

In terms of his review of the state's finances, we have acted on that in this Budget, with more comprehensive information with respect to the budget papers. You will see we have expanded the information available for members of the public and others to understand the budget. I am pleased that is represented in the budget papers.

We are backing the Budget. You would have noticed an announcement regarding a parliamentary budget office that Mr Eslake made reference to. There is $100,000 in the Budget to progress that and I have indicated a positive disposition. We have to do the work to ensure we have the parliamentary budget office. That investigation will be undertaken over 12 months and then we can positively progress with a parliamentary budget office. I believe it will be of great merit. That will allow people on the other side and elsewhere to deliver an alternative budget. That is a question for Labor, of course. Today is the day when you can do that. The ball is now in your court.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. Am I getting a supplementary?

Mrs Beswick - I do not think there is any point.

A member - Fair enough.

Members interjecting.


Budget 2025-26 - Energy Asset Privatisation

Mr WINTER to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.42 a.m.]
Thank you to the member for Braddon for that.

Premier, you are sending Tasmania broke and now you are selling assets to try and pay down your massive debt. Your Treasurer's budget speech ruled out the privatisation of a handful of government businesses and confirmed that even more were on the chopping block. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.8_D=3.8_C=0.64]  Our power companies, TasNetworks, Aurora and Momentum Energy - which is part of Hydro [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.6_D=1.8_C=0.69]  - are all on the updated hit list [Bookmark: Phr4_O=33.3_D=11.1_C=0.81] . As we have seen in every other state that has tried it, privatising electricity assets means higher prices for households.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member on my right.

Mr WINTER - Why should Tasmanians pay for your budget mismanagement with higher power bills?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, members on both sides.

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=47.8_D=2.0_C=0.94] Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. When people write these questions for you [Bookmark: Phr7_O=63.5_D=16.8_C=0.66] , do you think, 'Yeah, but what am I going to say, because I believed in that.'

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - You ruled out these sales 12 months ago. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - 'I believed in privatisation of electricity assets at one point in time so how am I going to get through that one?' Honestly, I can point to [Bookmark: Phr8_O=81.7_D=26.5_C=0.83]  serious backflips even in that question, and selective quoting in one of your questions you mentioned today. I have found my contribution to the Parliament of Tasmania on 21 June 2011.

Mr Winter - You are saying the quote is inaccurate? 

Mr ROCKLIFF - What I was actually talking about [Bookmark: Phr9_O=108.7_D=2.2_C=0.89]  was the Liberals' alternative budget [Bookmark: Phr10_O=112.0_D=19.0_C=0.67] . 

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I said:

The Liberals' alternative saves these frontline jobs in police and health, protects and invests in education and schools and delivers a better bottom line.

I commended the leader of the opposition at the time, Will Hodgman, et cetera. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=131.3_D=26.0_C=0.65]  I said:

The Liberals' alternative budget gets priorities right. 

Mr Winter - And never delivered any of it.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I was talking about our alternative budget, as well as the context of your incompetence at that time -

Mr WINTER - Point of order, honourable Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. As much as I am enjoying whatever this is, I asked a question about the privatisation of energy assets and I wonder if you can bring the Premier back to the question.

Mr Abetz - Which you supported.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, members on my right. I will draw the Premier to the original question, rather than the question that he wants to answer from before.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am looking forward to this, or a version of this - 

The SPEAKER - I am assuming that the Premier is quoting, not using a prop?

Mr ROCKLIFF - today, that is Labor's Plan for Budget Repair. I have just written on '11 mistakes' in it to remind myself of how many mistakes [Bookmark: Phr14_O=187.8_D=5.5_C=0.53]  and the various versions that came our way.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Anyway, on the privatisation, we have been having a good hard look. Due diligence is being done by Mr Eslake, the first stage of whose report has been released. He is now doing further work. That is not to say that all the remaining Tasmanian assets will be sold at all [Bookmark: Phr16_O=221.2_D=6.0_C=0.87] , but doing further work to ensure that we get the best outcome for Tasmanians.  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=228.0_D=12.1_C=0.68] We have outlined a sensible fiscal and economic reform agenda. It does include looking at asset sales -

Budget 2025-26 - Community Sector Funding

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=245.5_D=29.7_C=0.88] Ms ROSOL question to MINISTER for COMMUNITY SERVICES, Mr JAENSCH

[10.47 a.m.]
Many community service organisations entered the budget lock-up on Thursday with no idea if their funding would be renewed. Budget papers gave little reassurance before they heard of funding cuts that mean they cannot do all their important work. On Friday, at the Tasmanian TasCOSS budget briefing, you told organisations, 'If you've got a funding agreement with an end date on it, you need to be planning for that to end and not to be depending on it.' Also, you condescending [Bookmark: Phr19_O=275.5_D=27.1_C=0.83] ly told them to be more efficient and innovative in their work - effectively, 'you get what you get and don't be upset.'

While you demand efficiency and innovation from community organisations, your government is wasting enough on a stadium to house the whole housing waiting list. When will you stop patronising community organisations, show them respect and fight for their funding, instead of a stadium that is only going to increase the work they need to do?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. Similarly to the last question, we are deeply engaged in a conversation with our community sector about how we deliver more for Tasmanians in need - how we have new ways of working with them that reduce the costs to them of managing the funding agreements and grants, and the uncertainties and the short terms that are embedded in the way that we are working now. They want this; we are working with them. I am not laying down any ultimatum for them about making them work more efficiently. They want to have less transaction costs and less overheads in their operation.

Ms Rosol - 'Plan for the contract to end' is what you said.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass.

Mr JAENSCH - They want to cut red tape and we want to do that with them. That is the way we will continue to get better outcomes for the investment, and more appropriate forms of purchasing services from that sector. We are on a journey with them.

Ms Rosol - You asked them to find efficiencies in their work. They are two separate things.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass, Ms Rosol.

Mr JAENSCH - I entirely reject the premise that it is punitive or condescending to them. We have also included in the Budget an added investment of $150,000 to work with TasCOSS and with the sector on identifying other areas where they can innovate and reform within the community services sector itself, for example, shared service models, the ability to have joint contracting, the ability to work together to secure appropriate insurances in the sector, which is something that has been increasingly difficult and expensive to do. These are real challenges faced by this sector. We take them seriously and we will work with them to ensure that we can further develop and innovate in our community services sector.

We are not treating them as people who come to us petitioning for funds. They are an essential sector in delivering the wellbeing and quality of life of Tasmanians in need. We respect them and we work with them. Like with any other sector or industry, like tourism, agriculture or primary industries, we will work with them to continuously innovate and improve how we work together. This is an important sector for Tasmania and for Tasmanians. We take it very seriously and we will keep working with them on doing it even better.

Supplementary Question

Ms ROSOL - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary.

Ms ROSOL - The minister has spent quite some time talking about increased efficiencies in the way contracts are organised. He also asked for increased efficiencies in the way that community service organisations provide their funding. Why is the minister demanding that, while at the same time effectively cutting funding to these services?

The SPEAKER - I will allow the minister to address the question again. I think he did touch on this, but I am not sure you will get a different answer, Ms Rosol.

Mr JAENSCH - I am not demanding that anyone become more efficient. What I am responding to are the issues raised with us by the sector that say it is inherently inefficient to receive a short-term contract for one or two years -

Ms Haddad - You are telling them to expect them to expire.

The SPEAKER - Ms Haddad.

Mr JAENSCH - You spend the first six months recruiting, then the next six months training. You get half a year of service out of someone before they start looking for a new job, and then you have to start all over again.

These are the sorts of things that make that industry difficult to run. We want to work with them to do it better. We think that is fair and reasonable. That is where we are looking for efficiency - removing overheads and the cost of delivering. It is not so that we can reduce the amount of money that we pass on to that sector and we enter into agreements for, but so that they can do more of the work that they are geared to do and we can work with them to support that.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Can I just remind members on my right that even though they are supporting the minister on their feet, they are still interjecting. It does not change because it is a positive interjection. The Leader of the Opposition has the call.


Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.52 a.m.]
You are sending Tasmania broke and you are now selling assets to pay down the debt. Your updated privatisation hit list also includes MAIB and Metro Tasmania. Privatising Metro will lead to more service cuts and higher fares, and selling off the MAIB will lead to higher car registrations for all Tasmanians. Why should Tasmanians pay more to get to work and get around just because you cannot manage the budget?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker I thank the member for his question. The Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry summed it up when it said:

Tasmania deserves nothing less than a government with an ambitious reform agenda. This is, without doubt, the most ambitious, reform-oriented state of the state speech in over 20 years and the TCCI supports what Premier Rockliff outlined.

That is what we are embarking on, looking at matters. You have reflected on the Budget - a very transparent budget that did not include asset sales within it. There may well be asset sales that we can reflect in future budgets, which would support our debt position, but that work is still being sensibly done by Saul Eslake. We are going to continue investing in infrastructure and building a better Tasmania, because that employs people. It creates an economy and allows us to fund essential services, or a new bridge. Was it not great to be at the opening of the Bridgewater Bridge the other day?

It was fantastic to have the Labor Prime Minister there. I was looking around for state Labor members, but could not see any.

Members interjecting.

Ms Butler - I was there; I was not invited to the formal proceedings. Thanks for the invite.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Oh, you were there. 

The SPEAKER - Member for Lyons, do not bite.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I saw the member's Facebook post, walking with her family across the bridge and celebrating -

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker.

The SPEAKER - I will hear the point of order from the leader.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my right, he is allowed to have a point of order.

Mr WINTER - Standing Order 45, relevance. The question was specifically about the privatisation of MAIB and Metro. Could you bring the Premier to the question?

The SPEAKER - I will ask the Premier with his remaining 57 seconds to address the specific entities named.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you. It is a matter of transport, and I will come to buses driving over the Bridgewater Bridge in just a moment. Ms Butler broke ranks with her party, probably because Ms Butler wanted to do something positive and be seen with something positive, as I did in 12 years of opposition, going to openings of schools and irrigation developments, because it is great to take part in something positive and not be critical every single time. Frankly, it was embarrassing not seeing a single state Labor member at that opening.

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - You did not invite us.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Embarrassing for you when you had the opportunity to be bipartisan.

Budget 2025-26 - Social and Affordable Housing

Mrs PENTLAND question to MINISTER for HOUSING, PLANNING and CONSUMER AFFAIRS, Mr ELLIS

[10.55 a.m.]
This year's budget confirms we are failing to provide adequate housing for far too many Tasmanians. Nearly 5000 people remain on a housing register, with Tasmanians deemed a priority waiting an unacceptable 94 weeks to get a roof over their heads. This morning we learnt the residential land rebate program has not led to a single sale in 10 months. There was a time when housing was your government's priority, but lately it has all been stadium, stadium, stadium. Why have you taken your eye off the ball when it comes to providing basic human rights?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Bass for her important question. Our government is absolutely focused on delivering a better Tasmania now and for the future, and taking action on the things that Tasmania really care about, which we have said quite clearly: cost of living, health, housing and keeping the community safe. We are laser focused on delivering more houses. That is why we are on track to deliver our ambitious target of 10,000 social and affordable homes by 2032, and we have already delivered more than 4300.

That puts us on track, but we know that there is more to do. I have to echo the Premier's comments about the Bridgewater Bridge. It has shown what Tasmanians can do when we have a big building goal - that we can deliver these kind of things, lead the nation, and ensure that future generations have the infrastructure they need, whether that is transport or housing. It is quite clear that the investment laid out in the Budget for housing will be significant to delivering our targets.

We are on track, but we know that there is even more to do. Over the last four years, we have delivered 4300 homes. Over the next seven, to reach that target, we are confident that with the funding that is in the Budget, we will be able to deliver the balance.

It is also important for this House to remember that we need to cut red tape to ensure that there is a pipeline of work coming through for our builders, particularly in social and affordable homes.

I really encourage members that when our Development Assessment Panel Bill comes back that will ensure that social and affordable housing developers can get a fair go if they meet the planning scheme, that that bill is supported, because that will clear the path. We are hearing too many times, where social and affordable homes are sought to be built, they are blocked by their local planning authority despite meeting the rules. It is clear that we need to back in those people with more funding, as is in the Budget, but stronger rules of the road that are faster, fairer and simpler for those people.

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - You are kidding me. Eleven years, that one, it is back.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left and right.

Mr ELLIS - We will be working diligently to deliver the funding and the red tape reduction that people need so that they can get the homes that they need.

The work that we have undertaken with a range of residential land releases have delivered more than 3000 homes out into the community. We are looking forward to building on that further because that is our pipeline of work: releasing affordable land so that people can build their homes. It does not deliver homes now. What it does is deliver homes for the future and that is the key part of the reason why we have such a strong pipeline of work, so that the Tasmanian community can have confidence in us continuing to deliver on our targets. We are on track, but we will continue to invest so that we get there.


Budget 2025-26 - GBE Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.59 a.m.]
You have wrecked our budget and now you are selling assets to try and pay down your debt. Your updated privatisation hit list includes TasPorts. That means the iconic Burnie port is effectively up for sale. That means Devonport, the home of our Spirits, is effectively up for sale. Bell Bay, the key economic asset, is on the hit list: in Hobart, our Antarctic gateway and the primary destination for cruise ships. Privatising our ports will increase costs to industry, tourism and businesses that bring in everyday essentials from the mainland. Why should they suffer because you cannot manage money?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my right. Can I ask you to repeat the last part of your question?

Mr WINTER - The whole thing, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - No, we will just go with the last two lines. Nice try.

Members interjecting.

Mr WINTER - I know you do not like it.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order. The Leader of the Opposition will repeat the last part of his question; the actual question part of his question.

Mr WINTER - Sure.

Mr Jaensch - Yes, the question part.

The SPEAKER - Without members on my right interjecting again, minister Jaensch. 
Mr WINTER - Privatising our ports will increase costs to industry, tourism and businesses that bring in everyday essentials from the mainland. Why should they suffer because you cannot manage money?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I will refer to my previous answer when I spoke of Saul Eslake's work and the first stage of the work which you mentioned in that question, and the next stage of the work now where other government business enterprises are being thoroughly looked at to see what is in the best public interest, in Tasmania's interest, whether we keep those assets in Tasmanian hands or can deliver services better if they were in private management.

The work is being done diligently on TasPorts. We do not need a scare campaign from the member about individual ports. That is irresponsible, and you know it.

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - Rule it out then.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The Labor government has sold assets before. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left and right.

Members interjecting.

Ms Butler - You are selling our ports in an island state. 

The SPEAKER - Member for Lyons, I should not have to make a special reference to people.

Mr ROCKLIFF - There are many organisations you sold in your time in government. The Hobart airport is an example of that. Norris Carter spoke really well the other day at breakfast, lunch and dinner. I commend Mr Carter for his leadership of the Hobart Airport, which has seen significant investment and upgrades for the Hobart International Airport, partnerships with government - particularly when it comes to the federal government with the $60 million investment to support the heavier pavement for the runway. That allows our government to work with airlines across the globe, whether that be Hong Kong or elsewhere, potentially. We can have those direct flights into Hobart, which would be a huge boon for our tourism industry, but also fantastic to get our perishable freight off island straight into market. That greater bay area around Hong Kong is an 86 million population, which we can benefit from.

No one stops me in the street and says, 'Can we please keep or take back Hobart Airport and put it in public hands?' No one ever says that to me. Why? It is because it is being very well run and invested in, in private hands right now. 
That is not to say that we are going to sell the ports that you just mentioned.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the questions has expired. I give the call to the member for Lyons, Ms Badger.

Mr Rockliff - Due diligence.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, I have actually given the call to Ms Badger.


Forestry Tasmania - Proposal for Privatisation

Ms BADGER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.04 a.m.]
The Treasurer's budget speech confirm that you will hold a fire sale of government businesses and public Crown land to service your warped investment priorities such as the new billion-dollar stadium. It appears that Forestry Tasmania is on the chopping block - a heavily subsidised government business, the equivalent of which in other states has been closed. No sensible private entity would buy or lease Forestry Tasmania without a huge financial incentive, such as taking custodianship of the public forest estate. Forestry Tasmania holds over 800,000 hectares of land on behalf of Tasmanians. This is country of significant Aboriginal value, biodiverse and carbon-rich native forests, and a plantation estate.

In a climate and biodiversity crisis, we should be transitioning Forestry Tasmania, not flogging it off. Will you now rule out selling or leasing Tasmania's public forests - our environmental and cultural assets - to service your economic debt?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank you for the question, member. It is refreshing to hear the Greens support Sustainable Timber Tasmania and extol the virtues thereof. My understanding is that in 2011, Labor and the Greens sold a 50 per cent stake in softwood plantations to new forests for $156 million, with the state maintaining ownership of the land.

Members interjecting.

Dr Broad - It is not as if you did not sell the plantations. Did you sell plantations as well? Did you do that? Hardwood plantations?

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Dr Broad.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will say to the member that when it comes to this particular matter, I believe that we have another conspiracy theory from the Greens when it comes to our sustainable and renewable native forestry sector.

Ms Badger - So you are going to rule it out, then?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Ms Badger does not need to interject just because Dr Woodruff is away.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Our productive native forests are for the benefit of the people of Tasmania - to provide wood and wood fibre for a range of products we use in our everyday lives, including timber for homes and furnishings, wood fibre for paper and cardboard - and to support the phasing out of single-use plastics, and our iconic special species timbers that are celebrated the world over.

Thousands of Tasmanians do rely on our productive native forests for their jobs and their livelihoods. Active forest management increases carbon storage, reduces fire risk, provides employment, and keeps our forests healthy.

To the member's question: we are going through a careful and methodical process with all our GBEs to ensure they remain fit for purpose and are set up for success. Our forests are not for sale, and to assert otherwise is simply fact-free fearmongering, which is a specialty of the Greens.

Ms Badger - So you are ruling it out?

Mr Bayley - Are you ruling it out?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members of the Greens will cease their interjecting.


Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.08 a.m.]
The businesses and assets on your privatisation hit list are set to provide more than $600 million of funding for Tasmanian schools and hospitals over the budget period. Where will you find the money for health and education if you privatise the assets that help pay for them?

Mr Barnett - In the Budget.

Mr Winter - No, it is not in the Budget. Who said that? The Treasurer said it is in the Budget.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, the Premier has the call.

Mr Winter - It is not there, Treasurer.

Mr Ellis - It might be in the alternative budget.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. Our support for education, health, community safety, and housing is very much in the Budget - $10 million a day for health, for example. That is why I look forward to your alternative budget today, where you will outline points of difference, where you will say where you will tax and what you will cut to get a sustainable pathway to surplus. I look forward to that because there has been an absence of it in the last 11 years, sadly.

Mr Winter - You have just accepted what you are doing is not sustainable.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I know why you selectively quoted from my comments of 21 June 2011 - it was because I was talking about an alternative budget. Should you have highlighted that in your question, it would have exposed you for not delivering an alternative budget for the last 11 years.

Dr Broad - Such a garbage argument.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We look forward to that, and thank you, Dr Broad -

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question was: if these assets are sold that provide $600 million worth of revenue to the budget, how is the Premier going to pay for schools and hospitals?

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to the original question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Can I also say, I was intrigued by the member's saving -

Mr Winter - Speaker, you just bought the Premier back to the question. I think he is about to divert again. Can he please answer the question?

The SPEAKER - We will see if the Premier does divert. It would be ambitious for him to do so, because I have drawn him to the question once.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, but this is very important when it comes to budget management and alternative budgets - the member has pointed to him saving the budget by investing in digital health transformation, which I announced in 2022, $476 million investment in a digital health transformation -

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker.

The SPEAKER - I will not need to take the point of order. I will draw the Premier to the question, not on relevance, but because I have already drawn him to the question twice, and I would not want the Premier to find himself in defiance of the Speaker's instruction. That would be an awkward position for all of us today.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The member particularly mentioned health and education in his question, which are all comprehensively funded over the next four years -

Mr Winter - Using the dividends from the businesses you are selling.

Mr ROCKLIFF - including digital health transformation program, which is a 10-year program: an idea that we actually started implementing three years ago - an idea you will present in your alternative budget.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - It is to repeat the question, which was: where will you find the money for health and education if you privatise the assets that are helping to pay for them?

The SPEAKER - I will allow the supplementary question as the original question and I look forward to the Premier's answer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We are investing $24.5 billion over the next four years in health and education. We are very proud of that. We are continuing to find efficiencies across our health system - and other agencies, but starting with our health system, with our digital health transformation program. That is why I was intrigued by your big announcement that you are spruiking yesterday about your big idea for saving the budget -

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - I draw the Premier to the question. You have 20 seconds left.

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - That is a slow walk.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, members on my left.

Mr Winter - 'Help'?

Mr Rockliff - What was that?

Mr Winter - You might need a distress call here. What is the answer?

A member - Rude.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, members on my left.
Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the member for the question. In my humble opinion -

Mr Winter - Two, one, saved by the bell.

Dr Broad - He gave up.

Mr Abetz - Well done.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - With that, the Premier will resume his seat.

Mr Winter - See you later, mate. Hopeless.

The SPEAKER - If everyone is quite finished, I will give the call to the member for Braddon, Mr Garland.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Federal Funding Promise
 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=17.7_D=9.8_C=0.77] 
Mr GARLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.12 a.m.]
On Sunday, you had a good catch up with the Prime Minister and minister Catherine King as you walked across the new Bridgewater Bridge. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=28.4_D=19.6_C=0.78]  Did you discuss with them the $240 million they have promised for the Macquarie Point precinct and whether it would be withdrawn if your stadium enabling legislation did not pass the parliament? If not, what conversations or correspondence have you had with them about whether the $240 million in funding is contingent on the stadium being built?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=60.9_D=25.8_C=0.84] Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I had good conversations with the Prime Minister and minister King, as you mentioned, about a range of issues. I had a good conversation with the Prime Minister following the bridge opening about a range of issues concerning Tasmania and Tasmanians - the health funding agreement, which is so critical [Bookmark: Phr5_O=87.8_D=4.4_C=0.88] , and the NDIS reform, which is so very critical. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=93.2_D=25.4_C=0.83]  We also touched on the smelter challenges around the nation as well as other key points. 

We spoke about the AFL team and the AFLW team, and the Prime Minister reminded me - not that I needed reminding - of his first foray into Macquarie Point [Bookmark: Phr7_O=119.6_D=4.3_C=0.77]  - a $50 million investment, which I believe, if my memory serves me correctly, was [Bookmark: Phr8_O=125.8_D=24.6_C=0.75]  advocated for and found by Mr O'Byrne at the time. The Prime Minister is very proud of his infrastructure record. I would be, if I was him. There have been other great Infrastructure ministers across all sides of politics, including the Coalition, but we are both very excited about the opportunity that the Macquarie Point [Bookmark: Phr9_O=151.2_D=4.1_C=0.79]  redevelopment and that urban renewal project will deliver, including the stadium. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=155.9_D=14.4_C=0.77]  I thanked him for supporting us with the $240 million, because at the time it was very difficult for the Prime Minister to do, because of Labor opposition to the project in the state, Mr Winter, and from the federal-level opposition, Jonno Duniam - 

Mr Bayley - Did he say if he is going to take it away if we do not get a stadium?

Mr Winter - Was Eric still there or was he gone by then?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It was difficult, but good projects are worth fighting for, and for that the Prime Minister and I are on a unity ticket.

CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Metro Tasmania - Half-Price Bus Fares - End of Scheme

Ms BURNET question to MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

[11.15 a.m.]
Peter from West Hobart wants to know: does your budget announcement mean that the cost of catching a bus will revert from half-price to full fare in metropolitan areas as of 1 July? Some of the state's most disadvantaged people live in outer metropolitan areas, including those holding multiple jobs. If someone is travelling from Chigwell into the city, how much will their fare cost, and how does that compare to the people travelling from New Norfolk? Will outer suburban metropolitan commuters effectively be disadvantaged by your ad hoc approach to fare setting?


Conara - Red Hill Railway Crossing - Danger to Drivers

Ms BUTLER question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE, Mr VINCENT

Mike from Scamander has been driving trucks for 48 years and has driven over five million kilometres. Mike would like to know if your department has any plans to redesign the colloquially named [Bookmark: Phr15_O=255.9_D=6.2_C=0.62]  'Red Hill railway crossing', the concrete bridge on the Esk Highway, about four kilometres east of Conara. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=262.6_D=29.7_C=0.82]  Mike states:

It is a very narrow road bridge where people can get in trouble if two large vehicles meet on top of it. If there is anything over width there is practically no room for the oncoming vehicle. 

According to Mike, 'There is no room. There is not enough width there'. There have been numerous accidents at this site as well as a fatality. This is a dangerous black spot for truck drivers and passenger vehicles alike. Will the minister please intervene, find a solution and [Bookmark: Phr17_O=292.7_D=12.3_C=0.78]  heed the expert advice from Mike, the truck driver?


Metro Tasmania - Half-Price Bus Fares - Regional Routes

Mr SHELTON question to MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

I regularly hear from constituents in my electorate of Lyons regarding the benefits of the government's half-price fare policy, and I am pleased to hear that this has been extended for students and regional routes. Can the minister please provide me with additional details as to what regional routes or areas will be included as part of the policy extension?


Prosser River - Dam Wall Inspections and Lifespan

Mr JENNER question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Ms HOWLETT

My constituent question is from Robin of Spring Beach. Prosser River's iron dam wall is deteriorating due to corrosion, and with the recent access improvements and machinery boring into the bedrock. Could you confirm when the dam wall was last inspected and its expected lifespan?


Port Sorell - Urban Boundary for Public Transport to Latrobe School

Dr BROAD question to MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

A group of concerned parents from Port Sorell want to know why their only public high school option at Latrobe is zoned by the government as being part of urban Devonport. Because the students travel from a non-urban to an urban area, parents have to pay bus fares. Why should parents from Port Sorell and surrounds have to pay bus fares to get their children to high school because of an invisible urban boundary on a map that does not make any sense?

MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Government Budget Management

[11.22 a.m.
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House take note of the following matter: budget management. 

This is a government that has put the Liberal Party's short-term interests in front of the state of Tasmania's interests every single time. If you cannot manage the budget, you cannot govern this state in its best interests. In this last Budget, we have debt that is spiralling out of control. It is completely uncontrolled. There are no cash surpluses to be seen in the Budget or beyond. The assumptions in this Budget are built on a house of cards.

In recent days, the Premier has been talking about a slash-and-burn approach. He does not want to do a slash-and-burn approach. If they actually implement this Budget, that is exactly what will happen. Government expenditure across the forward Estimates is flat at 0.3 per cent.

This government likes to talk a lot about that 2013 Budget, and I have heard them do that in this House and elsewhere. Government expenditure in that year was 0.8 per cent. It was higher than what they are forecasting in this Budget, so this Budget is a house of cards. They are either going to implement harsh austerity, austerity that has never been done in living memory, or they are going to blow the budget, and we know from racing history, that is exactly what they will do.

The former treasurer predicted -3.5 per cent expenditure growth in his budget. What does he have to do? Come back to parliament and ask for more money. How much money was it? It was nearly half a billion dollars in just five months. This government cannot even keep a budget for five months. The debt is spiralling out of control. They cannot keep a budget. They keep coming to parliament and asking for more money on the credit card. What does it mean? It means rising interest costs that are on a trajectory like this.

The debt liability in the Budget is set to overtake the superannuation liability. It is the biggest liability in the Budget and it is out of control. The trajectory is out of control - $650 million in interest repayments just in the last year of the forward Estimates. That is not to pay the debt down, that is just to service the debt. That is a lot of money each year going into interest repayments that could be going to health, that could be going to education - $2 billion-worth of interest repayments across the forward Estimates cumulative. That is more than the state will be spending on ambulance services and emergency departments in the Budget. That is how shot this Budget is. It is the worst budget in the state's history, the most unsustainable budget in the state's history, and that is no exaggeration. 

What is their solution to all of this? It is to flog off public assets that Tasmanians have worked very hard, in some cases over 100 years, to build up. Public assets, public businesses that contribute to our revenue sources - $620 million-worth of revenue in the forward Estimates that will be gone if this government has its own way: money that pays for schools and hospitals, dividends and company tax equivalent offset payments that will be gone under this government. That is less money for schools and hospitals. At the same time, you will be putting up prices for Tasmanians and you will be seeing service reductions in those businesses. 

It is a thought bubble. When the Premier came into this place at the start of the year and said that it effectively bankrupted the state and everything was for sale apart from the Hydro - we know that that was not a promise that he could keep either because Momentum, a subsidiary of Hydro, is still on the chopping block.

What do we have right now? We have the credit agencies breathing down our neck. Last year they downgraded Tasmania's outlook from stable to negative. They are looking at a government that has no fiscal discipline, that pays no regard to their fiscal strategy, and that has weakening governance. These are the sorts of things that they are saying about this government, and that was about last year's budget. This Budget is actually worse, so it is going to be very interesting and, no doubt, concerning when we hear the credit rating agency's assessment of this Budget.

It is laughable that the Treasurer has to set up an efficiency unit of unelected bureaucrats to take his own government of 11 years to task for waste. What that tells me is that this government and these ministers have taken their eye off the ball and in their departments there are programs being delivered that are not value for money. This is a government that has created all of the problems. They want to hand that over to unelected bureaucrats. They do not want to do the hard work themselves or take ownership of it. They cannot manage the budget and they cannot govern Tasmania in the best interest of our state.

[11.27 a.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Treasurer) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I am very pleased and proud of the Budget. We have a strong and growing economy, $40.6 billion gross state product, record unemployment levels, the highest wages growth in Australia, record retail trade and we are getting the balance right with our budget. We have a clear and sensible pathway to surplus in 2029-30. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=15.2_D=9.6_C=0.85]  We are building a better Tasmania now and for the future, investing in the things that matter, like health and housin [Bookmark: Phr4_O=25.8_D=1.7_C=0.95] g, cost of living [Bookmark: Phr5_O=28.4_D=4.8_C=0.76] , and keeping people safe. This has been mentioned many times this morning by the Premier [Bookmark: Phr6_O=34.7_D=3.6_C=0.88]  and by various ministers in terms of the importance of the cost of living [Bookmark: Phr7_O=39.7_D=24.3_C=0.84] , housing, and delivering a roof over someone's head. These are all priorities for our government, and we have a sensible pathway to do that. We are doing that without raising taxes. That is in stark contrast to state Labor.

We will no doubt hear more from [Bookmark: Phr8_O=64.8_D=6.6_C=0.86]  the Leader of the Opposition later today, but what we do know is that they have plans to tax [Bookmark: Phr9_O=71.8_D=15.1_C=0.68]  and to cut. State Labor voted for increased taxes. Just a few weeks ago they voted to legislate increased taxe [Bookmark: Phr10_O=88.3_D=15.6_C=0.86] s, and this Chamber voted overwhelmingly for state Labor to produce an alternative budget, so we will see if they abide by the views of this Chamber in the next hour or so.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=104.6_D=29.5_C=0.84] There has been much mention of not just the Budget but the business community earlier today and I want to read to you the views of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I was very pleased and proud to be part of their breakfast, lunch and dinner, a roadshow in response to the Budget and this is what the chamber said. 

Businesses are very upbeat. We know that business confidence in Tasmania is strong. We know that businesses [Bookmark: Phr12_O=134.3_D=5.7_C=0.86]  are looking forward to the coming years with a very robust Tasmanian economy. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=140.8_D=14.5_C=0.86]  What's important in the Budget is there are a number of things there that will help to see our economy continue to grow. 

That is what Michael Bailey said when I was standing next to him in Launceston at our press conference on Friday. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=157.0_D=11.8_C=0.79]  I am very pleased and proud to be standing shoulder to shoulder with the business community, with industry, to say our economy is strong and growing and we are going to back you. We are going to back you in [Bookmark: Phr15_O=170.0_D=29.4_C=0.82] . When you look at our record since 2014, we have one of the strongest growing economies in Australia since 2014, we are in the top two. We are pleased and proud of it. The Tasmanian Small Business Council said of the Budget - 

Today's budget provides some bright spots for the future of new businesses. Funding on the skeleton of the Small Business Start Up permit is great news for intending entrepreneurs with a dream and a drive to realise their small business ownership dreams [Bookmark: Phr16_O=199.6_D=1.2_C=0.89]  in the coming year.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=201.9_D=25.2_C=0.86] The Tourism Industry Council welcomed certainty of funding for the state's destination market, at Tourism Tasmania over the next four years, enabling it to continue to promote the state on the national stage. You have seen the Premier with the vouchers announcement again yesterday with the Tasmanian Hospitality Association (THA) standing shoulder to shoulder promoting our visitor economy. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=228.2_D=4.1_C=0.75]  The THA said:

The Budget reaffirms the government's commitment to the sector [Bookmark: Phr19_O=232.9_D=29.7_C=0.81] , especially in key areas such as workforce development, regional support and community programs. 

Rural Business Tasmania:

We're pleased that the Rockliff Liberal government continues to support programs that bolster small businesses and primary industries. 

Tasmanian Irrigation:

Tasmanian Irrigation has welcomed this week's state Budget, which reconfirms funding commitments for the three major irrigation projects in Tasmania. 

See? The list goes on. It goes on and on [Bookmark: Phr20_O=263.0_D=25.2_C=0.76] . I am very pleased and proud of the Budget. I am confident in Tasmania's future, and I believe we have the balance right. Labor can wax lyrical. It will be a few moments now until we hear Labor's alternative budget or alternative plans to tax and cut. 

Time expired.

[11.32 a.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I thank the [Bookmark: Phr21_O=289.1_D=3.4_C=0.84]  member for Clark for bringing on this matter of public importance and [Bookmark: Phr22_O=293.2_D=11.8_C=0.81]  to talk about budget management in what will be the first of numerous opportunities to talk about Budget. Our leader, Dr Woodruff, will deliver the Greens' alternative budget tomorrow morning.

While this MPI is framed around budget management, it is really mismanagement that characterises this Budget, and it is an indictment on the government's priorities. At the end of the day, budgets are about choices. They are about political choices, they are about what you want to prioritise, they are about what you want to fund, and they are about who you want to support. For this government with this Budget, one of the worst in Tasmania's history, it is a significant and massive fail. It demonstrates a warped set of priorities that are putting money into things such as a stadium at Macquarie Point and into unethical, unsustainable activities instead of people.

To take a quick higher-level look at things though, there is a billion-dollar deficit in the Budget and $10.8 billion debt by 2028, costing us $650 million. This is intergenerational disadvantage that we are passing on to our children. To quote from Saul Eslake's quick analysis published on the day of the Budget, he says:

The financial position of Tasmania's public sector continues to deteriorate, according to the numbers presented in the 2025-26 State Budget presented by Treasurer Guy Barnett today. 

He goes on to outline a number of different things and then says:

In other words, the outlook for all the key Budget aggregates continue to get worse. 

He says there is:

A long way to go before there is a credible 'fiscal strategy' …

There is certainly also a long way to go before there is a credible pathway to surplus. You cannot have a pathway to surplus simply by repeating it ad nauseam in this place and pretending it exists. You actually have to demonstrate it. This Budget does nothing to demonstrate that into the forward Estimates. With the government so profoundly misjudging the figures and having to present updates in its Revised Estimates Reports and other supplementary appropriation bills, for example, we have absolutely zero confidence that the budget situation that is projected in the forward Estimates is going to come to pass in any way, shape or form.

Of course the stadium is, I think, the hallmark. It characterises this Budget. It was first promised at $715 million. That was capped with a capped government investment. The cap has now gone out the window, and of course the budget has blown out to $945 million. The Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) says this is going to cost us almost $2 billion in debt over 10 years in building and operation. It is such a risky site. It is a toxic site. It is a difficult site. Delay equals cost. It is utterly clear that this stadium is going to cost way more than $945 million, and it is going to cost taxpayers way more than $315 million. There are things such as the footpath uplift. Who is going to pay for the footpath uplift that is included in those permit conditions we just tabled today? Who is going to pay for the Collins Street bridge that we need unless we are going to shut Davey Street? It is an absolute joke.

The way the government is going to pay for this kind of mismanagement, debt deficit, and warped priorities is to flog off our government businesses, to sell government businesses to the highest bidder, ultimately passing on increased costs to the Tasmanian taxpayer, the Tasmanian user - and of course to cut services. They have already got the DOGE-style (Department of Government Efficiency) unit operating within government, the Efficiency and Productivity Unit (EPU), that is looking at what can be cut. We know that is going to target and impact on frontline services. The whole notion of front and backline services is a misnomer when you are talking about funding these kinds of jobs. It is an absolute travesty.

The Budget also includes a whole range of other insults, really. There is $10 million for a four-wheel drive track strategy on the Takayna coast, despite the fact that your own statutory advisory bodies from an Aboriginal perspective tell you not to do it. There is $7 million for greyhounds, a greyhound track in the north-west, despite the fact that it is cruel and despite the fact that Saul Eslake says it is a loss-making industry going forward.

There is a range of other things. When it comes to choices, it is really clear that you are ignoring the voices of the community. TasCOSS says:

Disappointingly, the Budget fell short on the Treasurer's promise to deliver on the things that matter to Tasmanians, like a safe and affordable place to call home, and paying for energy and healthcare. We are concerned the government has lost sight of what matters most to Tasmania. A new stadium will not help Tasmanians living on low income feed the family and get their foot into the housing market. 

Of course, there are also cuts across the board -

Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I cannot believe that the Treasurer would come in here today and say that he is pleased and proud of this Budget. Has he read the budget documents? This Treasurer should be ashamed and concerned about the state of Tasmania's finances, the state of our budget and what it means for future generations in this state. However, that just goes to show how delusional this government is. The Treasurer seems to see things from a parallel universe.

My colleague, Josh Willie, is quite right when he says that this government has put the Liberal Party above Tasmanians and the state of Tasmania from day one. It has always been about spin and political survival. You only had to attend each of the budget events put on by the TCCI to see that unfold even more. They run on spin, they are not honest about the current situation we are facing in Tasmania, and they cherry-pick quotes and the support that has been given for this budget document before the House today.
I remind the Treasurer of something else the TCCI said. It was not that long ago that TCCI CEO Michael Bailey said the TT-Line's announcement of delays to the Spirit of Tasmania ferries was 'a dark day for Tasmania.' He cited the economic cost to businesses and taxpayers, damage to the Tasmanian brand and a decline in business confidence. He also said it would be 'very difficult to trust this government again'.

This government has given up. It has given up managing the budget and given up on health and education in this state. This state has the worst health and education outcomes in the country. We have the lowest participation rate and 50 per cent of our population is functionally illiterate. That is shocking. That causes reduced productivity.

This government cannot manage the budget. It has demonstrated time and time again that it cannot manage major projects. Look at the new Spirit of Tasmania vessels. That is something that we should be proud of but, gee whiz, we are having to wait for them for a long time. Now, we have a situation where there is a defect with one of them, which was only picked up on a sea trial of the other one. If it were not for bad weather, it would be at sea. You come in here and talk about due diligence. This government has done no due diligence when it comes to any major project across this state, and the Spirit of Tasmania replacement program is the greatest example of that. You did not build a berth and the required infrastructure. What happened to due diligence then?

Today, the Premier did not rule out selling off our major ports across the state. These are strategic assets that are critical to Tasmania's economy and the wellbeing of our community and society. The Premier has the audacity to come in here and say that we are fearmongering about that. These are strategic assets. The assets outlined by the Treasurer in his budget speech bring in significant revenue to this state to pay for health and education. I am incredibly concerned that the Premier could not answer today, on the record in this place, where he will get that revenue from once he has flogged off our GBEs.

This government does not have a plan to fix the budget. It has a mythical pathway to surplus. They talk a lot, achieve very little and are letting Tasmanians down. They have given up on running the state, they have wrecked the budget, they have trashed our health and education systems and they have not addressed the structural challenges that exist in Tasmania's economy. They have done nothing to lift educational attainment or health and wellbeing. One of the Premier's goals was for Tasmania to be the healthiest state in the country by 2025. They have dropped that one as well. They have given up. They cannot manage the budget and they cannot run the state. It is time for a change, and I look forward to our leader Dean Winter's contribution outlining our ambitious plan for Tasmania.

[11.42 a.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, there is no doubt that desperate people make desperate decisions, and this government has lost its way, lost control and lost the willingness to care about the ongoing impacts of its budget mismanagement.

The three years the Premier has been leading Tasmania have been some of the worst years Tasmania has faced. The budget outcomes have been the three worst financial positions for Tasmania and more Tasmanians have lost their jobs in that period. The government talks positively about the 47,000 jobs in Tasmania, but we know there were 54,000 jobs in Tasmania. Under this Premier's leadership, 7000 Tasmanians' full-time equivalent jobs have been lost. Things are not okay in Tasmania right now due to the leadership and the mismanagement of this government over the financials of Tasmania. It is time for the government to stand up and tell the truth about that.

This morning, the Premier could not answer simple questions about the Budget his government has just handed down. My concern is that not only is the Premier unable to manage money, it also appears that he cannot read the Budget and does not understand the consequences of the ongoing mismanagement to Tasmanians. When asked, 'In what year will the debt stop increasing in Tasmania?', the Premier could not answer. The government talks about a fanciful pathway back to surplus but cannot answer simple questions. 

Desperate people when they are out of control make desperate decisions. My greatest concern for Tasmanians is that this government has not only given up leading Tasmania and responsible budget management, but is intentionally creating a worse financial outcome for Tasmanians so that future governments will have an almost impossible task to correct it.

Tasmanian Labor is seeking to be responsible with the budget and aggressive with the economy. Being responsible with the budget over time will mean correcting the mistakes and poor management of this government. The debt and deficit are the worst on record in Tasmania. Results in education and the quality of our health services are the worst in Tasmania's history.

We know that the privatisation agenda of this government is just a way to try and paper over the poor mismanagement over its 11 years in government. If this government gets to the point of selling Tasmanian assets that generations have built, we will lose the capacity to invest the dividends back into Tasmanian services - $600 million in just this period alone that would have been returned by our public assets into the Tasmanian budget to fund things like education and health. 

The budgetary pressures being experienced by people in our health system, police, firies and teachers are turning people away from those essential professions. People are under so much pressure because of the poor management and lack of care and support of this government that they are moving away from critical roles in Tasmania. If this government is allowed to continue with this poor mismanagement, Tasmanians will carry that burden. Tasmanians are feeling the pressure right now. We are moving into winter, when more Tasmanians need more support more often, and this government, with an unbelievable lack of care, is putting pressure on those services and organisations that are supporting Tasmania most. It is clear that the Premier and his government have given up. Not only do they not know how to provide for Tasmanians, but they do not care to do that any more. 

Not only can the government not manage money, but it cannot manage major projects. Look at the Spirits of Tasmania and the berth debacle. How is it possible that the government was not prepared to receive the ships? We cannot trust this government any more. It continues to stand up and present misinformation to the Tasmanian community about the state of Tasmania's finances, about Tasmania's economy and about the people who monitor that. Questions were asked in the parliament this morning about the outlook after this Budget, where the situation in Tasmania has been reshaped, and people are starting to make decisions that will make the debt burden even worse in Tasmania. This government, this Premier, have given up. They are causing distress to Tasmanians. Their impacts matter and make a difference to Tasmanians. They need to do better. They need to stand up and tell the truth.

Time expired.
[11.42 a.m.]
Mr BEHRAKIS (Clark) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I can only hope that, with this MPI today being budget management, that today will be the day that the opposition will finally listen to the will of the parliament and deliver and alternative budget. We wait with bated breath. Until then we will continue to hear from the so-called alternative government [Bookmark: Phr2_O=20.7_D=17.2_C=0.60] , talking about how they left the state with no debt. When they were last in government they raided the $1.5 billion superannuation account and sold assets like Hobart Airport to prop up their own budget failures, all while massively under investing in the infrastructure Tasmanians rely on. 

They then come in this place [Bookmark: Phr3_O=38.3_D=7.9_C=0.68]  railing against privatisation with an opposition leader who has more positions on privatisation under his belt than he has supposed places of birth. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=47.7_D=26.0_C=0.62]  Last time the so-called opposition tried to provide costed policies, which was their $4 billion election [inaudible 11.48.28 a.m.] it included $2 billion in phantom cuts and 11 corrections in their costings. Perhaps the parliamentary budget office might assist the shadow treasurer and finally providing an alternative budget. We will not be lectured on this side on budget management by a party that left this state with a huge superannuation liability [Bookmark: Phr5_O=74.5_D=6.3_C=0.71] , still will not take responsibility, and still will not respect the will of the parliament and tell the people of Tasmania what they would do instead.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=81.8_D=23.6_C=0.64] This year's Budget delivers on our promise: a sensible, sustainable pathway to surplus, not by slashing, burning and flogging off Tasmania's future like the last Labor-Greens government did -

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - A last warning for members on my left. I am sure you want to be here for your opposition leader's speech.

Mr BEHRAKIS - but with a clear strategy that protects essential services and jobs. Tasmania's economy is a strong and resilient one, now valued over $40.6 billion [Bookmark: Phr7_O=106.3_D=11.4_C=0.61] , reflecting sustained growth under the Liberal government stewardship. Since taking office, we have overseen an $8.5 billion increase in gross state profit, a 26 per cent surge that underlines the strength of our economy. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=118.6_D=29.2_C=0.75]  Tasmania currently enjoys the highest wage growth in the nation and record low unemployment, creating greater security and opportunity for working families. That means more Tasmanians in jobs, more than ever before. Business confidence is at an all-time high, driving local investment and innovation, particularly in small business and regional sectors like tourism, hospitality and infrastructure. 

Despite the legacy of COVID and significant investment to address historical injustices, the state Budget remains on a clear, responsible path to surplus [Bookmark: Phr9_O=148.3_D=10.6_C=0.66]  by 2029-30. Our fiscal strategy avoids harsh cuts or new taxes. Instead, we are achieving savings through productivity and efficiency reforms, including the establishment of the Efficiency and Productivity Unit.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=160.2_D=18.0_C=0.76] We are strategically managing debt, using it to fund intergenerational infrastructure while planning for it to peak and then reduce by 2032-33. These measures reflect a government that is balancing investment with accountability, ensuring Tasmania remains the best place to live, work and raise a family. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=180.1_D=18.6_C=0.73]  Families in Tasmania are seeing real support with record $550 million in cost-of-living measures, including the $60.00 renewable energy dividend for every household, electricity concessions valued at over $1400 annually for eligible households and support for water, sewage and council rates for pensioners.
 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=199.6_D=9.9_C=0.58] We are listening to our community. Over 300 submissions shaped this budget, ensuring that local voices, including those from my electorate of Clark, influence where funds were directed. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=211.0_D=13.4_C=0.79]  This means an investment in affordable housing and homelessness services, including continued support at the Bethlehem House site. It includes continuing funding for transport infrastructure improvements around greater Hobart, making it easier to commute, connect and grow local businesses.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=227.9_D=27.0_C=0.74] Our economy is strong. Tasmania now boasts record business confidence and the lowest unemployment rate in history. That means more opportunities for more Tasmanians right here. We have done it without raising taxes and we will not. Instead, we are working to increase efficiencies. We are introducing the small business startup permit, cutting red tape and enabling local entrepreneurs to launch with ease. The new Efficiency and Productivity Unit will ensure every tax dollar is delivered [Bookmark: Phr16_O=255.6_D=1.6_C=0.72]  with the best possible outcomes for you. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=258.5_D=6.2_C=0.81]  We are backing the industries that power our economy with over $2.5 million just to support small business growth.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=268.1_D=27.2_C=0.73] Our education and health systems are receiving record investment. Nearly $10 million a day is being invested into health statewide and over $2 billion into education in this year alone. We are not just planning now, we are building for the future. More importantly, this Budget reflects compassion and accountability with over $1 billion invested to implement the recommendations of the commission of inquiry and compensate victims of past institutional abuse. 

In conclusion, this Budget proves you can manage the books and support people at the same time. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=296.1_D=3.4_C=0.23]  It is a budget for all Tasmanians.

[11.52 a.m.]
Ms BURNET - Honourable Speaker, I stand here reflecting the disappointment of the public in this government, for the way priorities through bottom lines appear in the Budget. It is clear the government is not listening to the needs of Tasmanians nor acting in the community's best interests.

We certainly heard this morning in Question Time how disappointed the community sector is without certainty and have a diminishing funding arrangement thanks to the Minister for Community Services. He is not there in Cabinet to lobby for the community sector and it is shameful. Nor is the government listening to economist after economist who point to reigning in overspending. The government's blind spot when it comes to the stadium is really cutting into their vision. This is what Saul Eslake said: 'The Budget does not provide a clear and sensible pathway to surplus', as the Treasurer keeps saying, because there are no circumstances shown anywhere in the forward Estimates set out in the budget papers.

The government net operating deficits total of $3.5 billion over the four years to 2027-28 has gone up by $1.5 billion more than foreshadowed in the Revised Estimates Report published in February, and $1.8 billion more than forecast in last year's budget, with a further net operating deficit of $236 million projected for 2028-29. The debt goes on and the servicing costs of that debt will be phenomenal and a bad outcome for Tasmanians. This is a pattern of irresponsible behaviour by the Liberal government. Policy analyst, Martyn Goddard, has done the numbers on how much is written from infrastructure by the government every year over 10 years, bar one.

The 2024-25 budget outcome is 25 per cent underspent. Millions of dollars are ripped out from program deliveries such as the Montello Primary School upgrades - $8.8 million was budgeted in 2024-25 and likely only $1.8 million spent this financial year. It is not being delivered as budgeted. Funding was ripped from the Urban Congestion Fund. Almost 50 per cent will now be going to fund the Northern Access Road - a piece of critical infrastructure to supposedly deliver the Mac Point Stadium. This is an appalling mismanagement of the state's funds with no clear pathway to rein in spending and being honest with the Tasmanian people.

This government's priorities are warped. They are not consistent with good economic practice, and it is time that the government wake up to their responsibilities to the Tasmanian community.

Matter noted.


APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 2025 (No. 26)

Second Reading

Resumed from Thursday 29 May 2025 (page 45).

[11.56 a.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, Tasmania needs change because the Liberal Party can no longer be trusted to manage Tasmania's finances. This is a budget that will send Tasmania broke. If you cannot manage the budget, you cannot govern this state. 

It is now obvious that, once again, it will be left to Labor to clean up the Liberal's mess. The Liberals are racking up $11 billion of net debt through mismanagement and waste and the interest bill will hit more than $650 million every year, and they plan to put that on the credit card too. It is a mess that might take decades to repair. Tasmania needs change because the Liberal Party cannot be trusted with the assets Tasmanians have built together for 100 years. The Premier plans to sell our power network, our public transport and our ports, and he has even broken his promise to keep his hands off the Hydro. When you sell public assets, prices go up, jobs go offshore, and the dividends that help pay for our schools and hospitals disappear. We heard that just this morning.

This is the worst budget in Tasmanian history and it should be an embarrassment to every member of this minority Liberal government that it was handed down by them, yet on Thursday last week they applauded it.

Tasmanians have read the headlines over the last week: 'The Age of Austerity', 'Bad Apple Isle', 'Debt doubled, Assets Offloaded', '11 Digits of Debt'.' Some will have read the analysis from Saul Eslake who said: 'There is now a significant risk to Tasmania's credit rating. This Budget is an abrogation of the Premier's and the Treasurer's duty to do what is in the best interest of our state. It is a budget that serves the hopeless minority Liberal government for the next 12 months, not a budget for Tasmania's future. It is a budget that mortgages Tasmania's future. A budget that builds 10 record cash deficits in a row, and builds so much debt that, if implemented across the Estimates, Tasmania could well end up needing a bailout. It is reckless, reprehensible and soon, thanks to Labor, budgets like this will actually be unlawful without the approval of two thirds of parliament.

It is a budget that breaches nearly everyone of its own fiscal rules. In the not unlikely event of international rating agencies downgrading Tasmania's rating, it will breach yet another. The size of the debt will be so large that the annual interest repayments are equivalent to paying our entire ambulance and emergency departments - more than $600 million every year wasted paying interest.

We need a government whose top priority is creating and protecting safe, secure and well-paid jobs. We need a government that will get development and big projects moving. We need a government that has a plan to fix the budget, and we need a government that will deliver economic growth in every corner of this state. A better future is possible than the one promised by this Budget, but only if we change the government first, because the Liberals have given up and only Labor can clean up this mess.

The Budget proves beyond any doubt that Tasmania needs change, because it proves that Jeremy Rockliff's Liberal Party cannot be trusted with the state's finances. It means they cannot be trusted to lead our state. In 2014, Tasmania had no net debt - as the Premier would say, 'not one red cent.' In fact, there was $208 million of net cash and investments in the bank on 30 June 2014 and, to be fair, the start of the Hodgman government was pretty disciplined. We all accepted when Peter Gutwein's government was heavily focused on the COVID response, and the parliament gave him everything he needed to keep Tasmanians safe. When Jeremy Rockliff became Premier, there was still barely a billion dollars of net debt. Three years later, we are on a pathway towards $11 billion of net debt. This Premier has posted the three worst fiscal deficits in Tasmania's history, three years in a row. His budget plans are to make it four from four; then it will be five from five, then six from six.

If this Premier survives until 2028, six budgets as Premier will have produced the six worst fiscal deficits in our state's history and our state will be broke. The Premier simply cannot manage money. Any time there is a political problem, he gets out Tasmania's credit card. A mine on King Island got in trouble, so he bought a share and then bailed them out again. The candidate for Nelson was in trouble, so he tried to buy off the bowls club. Then, he let down our tourism and hospitality sectors so badly with the Spirits that he offered $10 million worth of vouchers so that Tasmanians could pay for other Tasmanians to go out for lunch or dinner - all on Tasmania's credit card.

These amounts of money might seem relatively small in the scheme of things, but when you are doing it time and time again, it all adds up. He has taken Tasmania's finances from the strongest in the nation to the weakest and caused our credit rating outlook to be downgraded by the ratings agencies. The Premier, his party and the independents who enable him are entirely responsible for this mess. Rather than taking tough decisions, they have taken from future generations. They put their political future ahead of Tasmania's future. They have given up trying to manage the budget and given away their right to govern Tasmania.

It will be left to Labor to clean up this mess. Tasmania needs change. This change is because of the Liberals' financial mismanagement; it is hurting Tasmanians and it will continue to hurt us for years to come. Most budgets are quickly forgotten, but this Budget will go down in history as Tasmania's worst. With the amount that government is spending on interest, we could more than double the size, staffing and resourcing of both our ambulance service and emergency departments. Imagine what we could do for health outcomes.

We could completely abolish payroll tax with the amount of interest we are paying. Imagine what we could do for business competitiveness and jobs. We could build thousands of homes each year for Tasmanians in need or we could increase the state's infrastructure budget by 50 per cent. Imagine how many new jobs that would create, how many young people would be given opportunities, and how significantly that would improve lives in communities across the state. You could give every household more than $2200 a year off their power bill and water bill for the next 4 years. Imagine how much that would help with the cost of living.

Thanks to the Premier's disastrous and selfish budget management, that money will be wasted on interest. Not paying down debt, just interest. You know what the worst thing is? They are planning to borrow that money too. It is like a household that has overextended on their mortgage taking out a credit card to help with the repayments. It is completely unsustainable, and I am furious with the Premier and the Treasurer. They have the nerve to come in here and pretend that there is nothing wrong.

If not for a one-off payment in 2017, the biggest cash surplus this century was $400 million under Labor in 2004. That means that it will take 27 consecutive years of the biggest surplus we have achieved this century to pay off Jeremy Rockliff's debt. If this Premier is allowed to keep going, the debt will be so large it will almost certainly be too large for any future government to pay off.

Tasmania needs change before this mess gets any worse, because it is even worse than it seems. The Budget is dishonest to its core. Just as they have done every year, they have hidden the true state of the Budget. No one in their right mind would believe that any government of any colour will be spending less in 2029 than it will in 2025. That would be, in real terms, a cut of more than 10 per cent to schools, hospitals, police - to everything. Even if the Premier had a credible set of budget papers and a credible plan to do something about it, it would not be enough, because this government has let our state down time and time again.

Tasmania needs change, because nothing is getting done under this minority Liberal government. The Spirits are now more than $500 million over budget and six years behind schedule. Projects they promised in 2018, like the Tamar Bridge, do not even have a design. Housing approvals are at record lows. There are no cranes in the sky. It is hurting our economy and costing jobs.

Most of all, Tasmania needs change because this minority Liberal government has the wrong plan for our future. Where will Tasmania be in 10 years if we continue like this? There will be even more debt, and they will still be pretending there is a pathway to surplus. Our best assets will be long gone - privatised forever. We will have even worse health services, fewer jobs, a stagnant population, flatlining economic growth. Our state simply cannot afford this Liberal government.

The Spirit of Tasmania fiasco has shown this minority Liberal government for what it is: absolutely hopeless. They bailed out a Finnish shipbuilder in secret during the election campaign with $80 million of Tasmanian taxpayer money and were not going to tell anyone about it. They forgot to build a berth for those same ships. The cost of that berth has blown out to $400 million. They misled the tourism industry and did not tell them for months that the ships' arrival would be delayed until 2026. They tried to lease the ships out as a floating refugee camp, before it turned out the Scottish Government was never interested. When that failed, they spent millions upon millions of dollars continuing to hide them in Scotland. They are still there, costing us millions, and now we are told they are defective.

The TCCI said it would be very difficult to trust this government ever again, and they are not the only ones. Just look at the list of broken promises. Here are the big ones: 'healthiest state in the nation by 2025'; 'Education results at the national average by 2022' ;'Keep Tasmania net debt free'; 'No deals for minority government.' Here are some of the projects: the Cradle Mountain cableway; the cable car at Kunanyi; light rail by 2025; a new Tamar bridge; a full redevelopment of the LGH; an underground bus mall; duplicating the Charles Street Bridge; SunCable; the northern prison; North West Tracks.

Here are the policies: a single statewide planning scheme; a short-stay levy -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will deliver the same amount of respect that was given to the Treasurer in his contribution. Thank you.

Mr WINTER - A short stay levy - no comment? Fire tax; keeping UTAS at Sandy Bay; 'not a red cent more'; 40,000 hectares of new forestry; a treaty to ban conversion practices; forced amalgamations of council; a ban on ramping. There are too many to mention. Despite all these broken promises, and not to mention the massive delays with others, they have still managed to completely blow the budget.

In the 2022 Budget, the Liberals said that year would produce an operating surplus of $126 million. The following year - the Premier's first budget - that was revised down to a $32-million surplus. The next year, that was revised down to a $148-million deficit. The deficit was then doubled by the mid-year budget update, then nearly doubled again in their election costings, and went further into the red with $792 million in the 2024-25 Budget. Over the course of this year, it has blown out by another $500 million to a deficit of nearly $1.3 billion. 

It is reckless, it is incompetent, it is irresponsible, and it is not remotely what Tasmanians were promised. This is exactly why Tasmania needs change. If last year's budget was an admission the Liberals have lost control of finances, this year's Budget lays bare the terrible consequences of their budget disaster. Since Jeremy Rockliff broke his promise and struck deals for minority government, 7000 full-time jobs have been lost. The reason the unemployment rate looks better is that people have given up looking for work altogether, with Tasmania having by far the worst employment participation rate in the nation. Tasmania's participation rate today is where the national rate was in 1983. Young people are leaving this state in record numbers, with net interstate migration losses recorded for nine consecutive quarters. On average, every four days another plane load of young Tasmanians sets off and leaves this state. 

Industries that have been the foundation of Tasmania's economy for generations at both ends of the state are in serious trouble. Tasmania has crashed from the top of the CommSec ratings to down near the bottom. Deloitte has projected a recession. This Budget predicts a negative State Final Demand figure for 2026-27 and Roy Morgan has found that Tasmania's business confidence is clearly the lowest in the country. Is it any wonder, when this minority government is completely trashing Tasmania's finances? Should we be surprised when they have shown time and time again that they cannot get anything done, when they do not deliver on their promises, and who is not worried when the only plan to get the budget back on track is to sack 2500 public servants, slash $180 million from community services and privatise the assets we have built together for 100 years.

Cutting jobs cuts confidence and selling assets leads to higher prices. Bigger deficits mean business taxes will have to be higher. This Budget is bad for the economy and bad for business. Tasmania needs change. The Liberals have given up on trying to manage this Budget responsibly. Labor will take action on day one to get things back under control. The Liberals have no plan to grow the economy. Labor has already announced more than a dozen policies to create safe, secure, well-paid jobs.

The Liberals want to privatise the assets Tasmanians have built together for 100 years, assets that keep costs down for households and provide funding for schools and hospitals. Tasmanian Labor will fight them every step of the way. It is clear from the Budget that the Liberals are hell-bent on selling the majority of our energy assets. They are planning to privatise TasNetworks, Aurora and Momentum Energy, a subsidiary of Hydro. That means privatising every power pole, every metre of electricity wire, every substation and the jobs of every maintenance crew. Imagine what that will do to the cost of energy.

It means flogging off our energy retailer and adding massive private profits to every power bill. It means selling Momentum, which makes money from mainlanders to offset our power bills. Power prices will soar under the Premier's plan, just as they have in other states that have gone down this path. The Premier is already planning to sell MAIB and Metro, which is bad news whether you rely on a bus or a car. It will mean higher bus fares, fewer routes, higher car registrations and more expensive insurance. Tasmanians will pay more every single kilometre they travel on Tasmanian roads. It is like one big, giant road toll.

We are an island state and the ports are essential for nearly every aspect of our economy. It will mean that every boat, every shipping container, every item on them will cost more in both directions. It will mean higher prices for Tasmanian households and greater cost for our exporters. It will be an economic disaster for our state and it will not stop there.

Sustainable Timbers Tasmania (STT) and Tasmanian Irrigation are apparently up for sale as well. These are companies that support thousands of jobs and businesses right across regional Tasmania. Our forestry sector will be decimated and STT's fire management and emergency response capacity will be lost. It is basically the Greens' policy. The fights over water we see in other states will be imported into our agriculture sector as well. Regional Tasmanians will pay for the Premier's plan with their jobs.

That is before we get to what it means for funding for our schools and hospitals. This Budget contains $620 million of revenue from the businesses that the Premier is privatising. That is money that will no longer be available to pay for teachers, nurses and construction projects because the Premier will have sent it offshore. It is social and economic vandalism of the highest order. It is a massive black hole in their budget, and it is why Tasmania needs change.
It is clear that this Premier, this minority Liberal government, is not capable of delivering the change that Tasmania needs. They have given up and once again it will fall to Labor to clean up the mess left by the Liberals. That is why it is so important that we have changed the Labor Party. I have been clear that under my leadership, Tasmanian Labor stands for jobs - for safe, secure, well-paid jobs. It is a fundamental and a non-negotiable for me.

It is why, as my first day as leader, I went to the west coast to show my support for those workers in the aquaculture industry. That is why I have announced legislation to stop the privatisation of Aurora. It is why I am backing a stadium - with a local jobs plan for the thousands of jobs it will create across the state. It is why I have stood up for our university and their plans to deliver a 21st century education for Tasmanians. It is why I backed Tasmanian business with plans to cut red tape, boost our night-time economy, run more day sailings on the Spirits, get renewable projects moving, and stop the power price increases the Liberals are putting on our smelters and major manufacturers.

That is why I have said 'enough is enough' when it comes to wasteful government spending, and announced a 10-point plan to start fixing the budget. That is why we are amending the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007 to bring more frequent assessments of the state's long-term financial position. That is why we are determined to cap budget deficits.

I am proud of the work that my shadow treasurer, Josh Willie, and I have done to present a policy to Tasmanians that does not allow this government to continue to run budget deficits the way that it has. No Tasmanian government has ever run budgets like this. It is completely reckless and bereft of any discipline whatsoever.

I am determined to do things differently. Under my leadership, the Labor Party has listened and the Labor Party has changed. We are back as the party of jobs and economic development, and we are back in the business of building. We are proudly pro-development, pro-business and pro-worker. We are proudly supporting the native forestry sector, salmon farming and mining. We want to change planning laws so we can develop our renewable energy assets instead of sitting around for years wading through red tape. We will always stand up for public ownership.

This Budget shows that Tasmanian Labor is the only party of responsible financial management in Tasmanian politics today. Labor has changed and Tasmanians are looking to us once again to turn this state around. 

I do not want people to support us just because this minority Liberal government has let them down so badly. Protest votes will not change Tasmania. I want Tasmania to support us because we have outlined a vision for this state's future and a plan to deliver it. I want Tasmanians to join me in imagining a better future of this state, to lift our collective ambition, and to trust me and Labor to deliver the change that Tasmania needs.

Conventions, conferences and trade shows contributed $200 million to Tasmania's economy each year, but less than 20 per cent of business events take place in the north of the state. Business event delegates spend more, stay longer and visit during otherwise quieter times of the year than holidaymakers. They are high value visitors. We need more of them visiting all regions in the state. Just as Jim Bacon's enduring legacy to Launceston is AFL football and the development of York Park, I am determined to make Launceston the premier regional destination for Australia in hosting conferences and conventions. The demand study has found that new multipurpose-built event venues expect to generate $28.5 million in new economic activity in northern Tasmania every year. What is most exciting is that private developers have already expressed interest in the opportunity with existing proposals, including Errol Stewart's vision. I am listening, and when I meet with the Launceston Chamber of Commerce and its members, this is something they are deeply committed to and excited about.

However, it is clear the opportunity is going nowhere under the minority Liberal government. In government, Labor will roll up our sleeves and collaborate with the Launceston City Council and local tourism sector developers to identify the best and most affordable proposal for the city within six months of taking office. We will also commit $20 million from savings we find in the Budget to fast-track the project and leverage private investment.

Last year I announced Labor's plan to appoint a Coordinator-General with real powers and real teeth, to unshackle the massive investment backlog for our state. We need a Coordinator-General who is not just a salesman spruiking the state, but who can get things done - with real power to coordinate environmental assessments, apply zoning changes, direct government businesses, and to support investors, not be blockers.

Today I announce that Labor in government will also fix the broken and confusing bureaucracy investors are confronted with when trying to do business in Tasmania. I struggle to find a single renewable energy developer with anything good to say about ReCFIT, while the office of Coordinator-General is seen as completely disconnected from the businesses and industries it was intended to serve.

I have looked closely at what different states do and I am inspired by the work of South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas, who has transformed his state's reputation as a can-do place for investment and a state where things actually happen. We need to change the way that investors perceive Tasmania as a place to do business. We need to make Tasmania the easiest place in Australia to do business. That is why I announced that a Labor government will bring together the resources of the Office of the Coordinator-General and ReCFIT into a single entity, Invest Tasmania, to be based in Launceston. Modelled on a proven approach in South Australia, Invest Tasmania will have a clear mandate and all the powers it requires to unlock $25 billion-worth of capital that is ready to be invested in our state but is stuck in planning rules and red tape. It will end the confusion for business-owners and investors dealing with multiple agencies and departments when they just want to get moving and invest in our state. 

By merging the resources and responsibilities of these agencies, Invest Tasmania will end duplication, save money and provide a much simpler single interface for the private sector to invest in Tasmania. Importantly, Invest Tasmania will report directly to me, as premier. I want to lead a government that is responsible with the budget and aggressive with the economy. I will back development investment every day of the week and with policies like these, I will get Tasmania moving again.

Perhaps the most short-sighted, counterproductive thing in this year's Budget, and let us be honest, there is a lot to choose from, is less funding in the Budget across the forward Estimates for modernisation in technology. This comes after the Liberals were last caught raiding $150 million from a fund designed to help support digital upgrades, which they spent covering budget blowouts last year instead. A Labor government will immediately restore the $7.2 million the Liberals have left out.
We will put it in an account alongside remaining funds that Liberals have not cut yet, and we will lock the account with legislation to ensure every cent gets spent modernising our hospitals. Tasmania's healthcare outcomes will be the worst in the nation for as long as we have the most technologically outdated hospitals. We cannot expect to deliver health services more efficiently than we need to, given the damage the Liberals have done to the budget when our health professionals spend so much time doing paperwork instead of caring for patients. We cannot expect to solve the serious and expensive problem of health workforce retention when nurses have to go in on their days off to check a paper-based roster that is still stuck on the wall.

The Premier says his government is spending twice as much on health than when they were first elected. The problem is health services are not twice as good. In fact, on almost every measure, they are worse. One part of the solution is to modernise our hospitals and free up time for our dedicated healthcare workers, and that is exactly what Labor will do. 

I have already spoken about how Tasmania has the lowest workforce participation rate in the country, and that fact is even more serious in regional areas where we are even further behind. One reason for that is our regions have some of the poorest access to childcare in the nation, and I am pleased that the federal Labor government stepped up in a big way with a policy to guarantee funding for cheaper access and resourcing for new centres and critically higher wages for educators.

In my job, I get to meet a lot of people working in a lot of different roles, and I think early educators have to be right up there with people I admire most. For our family, access to childcare has been essential. We do not have access to grandparents for our kids, and childcare is a big part of growing up and learning for our kids. It prepared them for school and made them more resilient, and they were more ready to learn when they got there. However, like so many others, we have been unable to get access to childcare when we have needed it. Meeting with people all over the state, this is an issue that constantly comes up, which is why I am so pleased that the state government has belatedly, begrudgingly adopted some of Labor's policy from the last election to open up government land and buildings for new centres and extra outside hours care. Too many Tasmanians have to refuse a new job or extra hours because there is no care available where they live - not just a waitlist for places, but sometimes there is no service at all.

I was in Strahan recently where there is a strong tourism industry and a secure future for our aquaculture, but nowhere for parents to send their kids for childcare. It is a clear market failure and that is why I am announcing today that a Labor government would allocate $500,000 over two years to work with the West Coast Council to operate a new small service for the west coast. We will do so until such time as a private provider will be willing to step up and take over. If the model is successful, we will look to roll it out in other regional areas where there is simply no support available for parents. Labor will back our regions by ensuring Tasmanians have the same ability to balance work and family no matter where they live.

The policies I have announced today do not require significant amounts of new spending. I believe a government with new ideas that is willing to think creatively about our problems can be aggressive with the economy while also being responsible with the budget. Not every problem is best fixed, or fixed at all, by opening the public cheque book, but thanks to the mess that Premier Rockliff has made of the state's finances, being responsible with the budget requires more than simply not making things worse. Being responsible means outlining an alternative to the Liberals' budget crisis.

On day one of a Labor government, we will deliver a 10-point plan to Treasury for implementation - but I know that is not enough, because since we announced that plan, the Premier's budget crisis has become even worse, even more serious. That is why, in addition, we will instruct government agencies to immediately abolish programs and positions that are not delivering good value to Tasmanians.

The Associate Secretary roles created by the Premier will be axed, as will 25 senior executive positions in the public service. That will save approximately $8 million per year. Any business grant programs without a competitive process behind them will be cancelled - no more funding freezers for grocers or AirPods for hat makers. We will cut the number of government media advisers in half, saving $5 million over the Budget and forward Estimates.

We will defer indefinitely the fifth lane on the Southern Outlet and work with the federal government to reallocate their commitment to higher priority road projects, saving $160 million. 

The tourism voucher scheme is a waste of $10 million. I know the Premier has let the hospitality industry down, but COVID-era stimulus programs are not the answer to a budget crisis.

Why does Larry Kestelman's private development at Wilkinson's Point, which involved public land being granted without a discernible process, receive its own $24 million capital allocation when other private developments receive no such support?

We will put a hard cap on departmental spending on consultants, government advertising and travel, saving up to $60 million per year based on blowouts from last year. Recently, a consultant was given more than $200,000 to write Tasmania's trade strategy. There is an entire section of State Growth dedicated to trade; it is called Trade Tasmania. What on earth are they doing if they are not writing our trade strategy?

To rein in the ballooning workers' compensation bill and protect workers, we will modernise the complaint system and reform return to work by centralising targeted support to avoid duplication across agencies.

We will abolish the Waste and Resource Recovery Board, saving $1 million per year, and change the law to end the requirement that landfill levy proceeds go to grant funds for composting and other low-priority projects. This will save up to $100 million over the Budget and forward Estimates.

We will make the delivery of infrastructure projects on time and on budget a key KPI for every departmental secretary. Labor will establish an internal jobs market for the public service, to allow jobs to be filled permanently by existing state service employees without advertising a full selection process. We will save money in recruitment, but more significantly, we will allow roles to be realigned to government priorities without adding to the overall size of the state service or involuntarily displacing existing workers. 

Tasmania's public servants are highly skilled. They are professional, and they are deeply committed to Tasmania. That does not mean that duties allocated to them by the government are always the best use of their expertise. Labor's internal jobs market will save money and create a more effective state service.
The measures will save the Budget more than half a billion dollars. While significant, they are only the start when it comes to addressing the budget problems created by this Premier. I cannot undo three years of damage in one speech. Billion-dollar deficits and $11 billion worth of debt require a long-term plan for budget responsibility.

That is why we are amending the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act to ensure Treasury undertakes a long-term assessment of the state's finances every term of government. That is why we have reintroduced amendments to the Financial Management Act and even the Constitution Act to expose budget blowouts, cap budget deficits, and return responsible budget management as a core responsibility of government. Responsible financial management will be non-negotiable in a government that I lead.

Between now and the next election, we will be announcing a significant number of additional policies to deliver the change Tasmania needs: policies to create safe, secure, well-paid jobs; policies to get Tasmania building again; policies to modernise our schools, hospitals and public services; and policies to boost regional economies. We will be responsible with the government and aggressive with the economy. Day by day, month by month, year by year, we will grow Tasmania out of the mess that the Premier and this minority Liberal government have made.

Tasmania has a choice between a minority Liberal government that has given up, or a Labor Party with a plan for change: between a Premier who has delivered the three worst fiscal deficits in Tasmania's history and whose only plan to fix it is a fire sale of the assets we built together for 100 years, or a changed Labor Party with a plan for budget repair; a minority Liberal government that has cost 7000 Tasmanians their full-time job, or a Labor Party that is focused on the fundamental purpose of creating safe, secure, well-paid jobs; a minority government that oversaw the biggest infrastructure stuff-up in history, or the Labor party that is proudly pro-development and has the policies we need to get Tasmania building again; a minority government that has broken its biggest promise on health and education and now wants to sack 2500 workers, or a Labor party with a plan to modernise our schools, hospitals and essential public services; a minority government that is out of ideas for regional Tasmania or a Labor party that stood strongly for salmon workers and knows we will only succeed if no one is left behind.

More of the same, or time for a change? That is the choice for Tasmania, and that is a choice for the parliament, too. When I became leader 12 months ago, the Premier had just signed a confidence and supply agreement with Mr O'Byrne, Ms Johnston and the Jacqui Lambie Network. The only confidence agreement I was committed to was the one with the Tasmanian community and, since then, we have uncovered the biggest infrastructure stuff-up in Tasmanian history.

The ferries fiasco is costing our economy half-a-billion dollars every year in lost revenue, and it is costing taxpayers $500 million in increased costs. The budget is wrecked and 7000 full-time jobs have been lost since the Premier went into minority. Our health and education systems are the worst performing of any state and young Tasmanians are leaving in numbers never seen before. As the TCCI said, it will be hard to ever trust this government again.

Labor does not have confidence in this Premier. Today, I have tabled a motion that says the House has no confidence in this Premier because he has wrecked the budget; because he is planning to sell our power companies, our ports and our public transport; and because no one can trust him after the handling of the Spirit of Tasmania fiasco. This is my message to the crossbench: the self-described 'true opposition.' If they really are opposed to the Premier's agenda of debt, deficit and debacle as they claim, then tell the House you have lost confidence in this Premier. When enough members indicate their support for my motion, I will move it. If not, they will show they are happy to go along with this agenda: all the debt, cuts and privatisation, and they will show Tasmanians that a vote for anyone except Labor is a vote for the Liberals. They can rest assured that we will let Tasmanians know exactly who is propping up this failed, incompetent, reckless, minority Liberal government.

Honourable Speaker, Labor has changed and it is only Labor that can be trusted to clean up this mess.

[12.30 p.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Speaker, well, that was a negative outlook for Tasmania, if you are a Tasmanian listening to that speech. It was full of inconsistencies and blatant hypocrisy, but most importantly, for Tasmanians, it talked this wonderful state down - a state that everyone has worked so hard over the last 11 years to take from economic laggard to leading the nation.

We have the lowest unemployment on record at 3.8 per cent, a growing economy, and we have worked hard to keep people safe, alive, in work and well through the pandemic. We will continue to support Tasmanians and invest accordingly. Still, after 11 years, there is no alternative budget. What actually hurts me to the core is the fact that you could criticise an investment to keep regional jobs. I am talking about King Island. I cannot believe how shameful it is that you talk down King Island - not only did you want to boycott their cheese when we are all working so hard to keep the King Island dairy alive, but also when we are going to invest to keep a mine going, which had been closed for over two decades. King Island has been desperate, over those two decades, to get that mine up and going for the local jobs and the local economy - you talk it down and criticise a public investment.

Dr Broad - You did not announce it. You had to do it to the stock market.

The SPEAKER - Dr Broad.

Mr ROCKLIFF - A public investment to keep those jobs alive. You never sound convincing when you talk about the sale of energy assets. Why? It is because you do not believe it. How do I know you do not believe it? It is because less than a decade ago, you were for it.

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - You said you would not 12 months ago.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You were passionate about it.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The interjections will cease. The Premier will continue his contribution and be heard.

Mr ROCKLIFF - As the member who just resumed his seat, I am proud of Tasmania and Tasmanians. The member said that he was proud of himself - proud of himself and, indeed, the shadow treasurer as well. I, of course, am proud of Tasmanians and what they have achieved over the last number of years since we have been in government.

To threaten the crossbench in such a nasty and bullying way is extraordinary -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is extraordinary that you would threaten the crossbench - the crossbench, incidentally, with individual members of parliament who have worked very hard for their constituents, to the extent, in actual fact, that they have delivered for their constituencies in our Budget - Mrs Beswick, Mrs Pentland, Mr Garland, Mr O'Byrne, and others.

Members interjecting.

A member - Nice bit of pork.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, if you wish a substantive allegation, do so. I will not cop these interjections.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That is what representing your constituency is all about: working and keeping government accountable, as all of the members I have just mentioned have done, but also putting aside the politics for the people of Tasmania, to ensure that the advocacy of community groups and organisations, through those members that I just mentioned, are reflected in this Budget. That is what good representation is all about.

I congratulate our Treasurer on the delivery of his first budget. It is a measured, responsible, and state-building budget. It is a budget that gets the balance right, a budget that is building a better Tasmania now and for the future, and a budget that keeps our economy strong, people in work engaged - getting up in the morning, going to work, contributing to Tasmania and providing food on the table for themselves and their families. That is what I am most proud of: those tens of thousands of jobs that we have created over the course of the last 10 years.

Our Liberal government is continuing to deliver our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future - as we should, because it is working. We have the economy to prove it.

In this place I often refer to the need to stand up for Tasmania and stand up for Tasmanians. That is what we are about, backing business, backing hardworking Tasmanians and backing economic growth, delivering jobs, stability and better outcomes for Tasmanians. The support that our Budget delivers to continue our commitment in this area has been made clear.

The 2025-26 Budget is delivered against the backdrop of a strong economy. It ensures that Tasmania's economy will continue to grow, keeping businesses going and keeping Tasmanians employed, in stark contrast to the absolute negativity we often see by those opposite: the Labor Party in this place. Our Budget has been well received by the Tasmanian community.

The Tourism Industry Council of Tasmania welcomes this year's Budget, citing that it will ensure Tasmania remains competitive on the national and international stage. The honourable shadow treasurer calls tourism marketing 'puffery', or whatever you said; we call it strategic investment to get people internationally and interstate into Tasmania, enjoying our hospitality and our wonderful natural environment.

The Tasmanian Hospitality Association said:

The Budget reaffirms the Government's commitment to the sector, especially in key areas such as workforce development, regional support and community programs.'

It went on to say:

The Budget demonstrates that the government understands the importance of hospitality to Tasmania's economic and social fabric,'

I was pleased to see our Treasurer last Friday alongside TCCI CEO Michael Bailey, speaking about the reforms our government is making with government businesses. This was the day after the release of the State Budget, and I was pleased to hear Mr Bailey's remarks when asked about the feedback from industry. The TCCI says business is upbeat because, as Mr Bailey pointed out, Tasmania has a very robust economy and because the Budget includes a number of things 'that will help see our economy grow'. Business and industry recognise the positive impacts our Budget has on the economy. The Budget backs business, backs economic growth and builds a better Tasmania now and into the future. 

Our government remains committed to doubling down on helping small businesses and cutting red tape. We have approximately 45,000 small businesses in Tasmania and they are the economic powerhouse of our state. They provide enormous benefits to Tasmania in terms of the goods they deliver, the services they provide, the people they employ and other generosity they give directly to the Tasmanian community. We value every one of these 45,000 small businesses.

We have committed to a number of red tape reduction initiatives to help make the lives of our small businesses easier. Our new red tape industry taskforce, comprised of peak bodies and other organisations, will help drive strategic solutions to cut red tape. We have engaged with organisations including the TCCI, Master Builders Association, Housing Industry Association, Tourism Industry Council Tasmania and the Property Council. They met with our red tape coordinator earlier this month and we look forward to the outcomes. We have established our red tape production e-hub. We are progressing with our Small Business Start-Up Permit to make Tasmania the startup capital of Australia. This bold and sensible initiative will make Tasmania the envy of all other states. 

We are also reviewing all state and local licences, permits and approvals, removing what may be outdated, duplicative, unreasonable or unnecessary with a view of removing those we do not need or improving what we can to make it easier for people who have to engage with government. The audit will identify outdated, redundant or excessive licences and approvals that no longer serve their purpose. We want to ensure that the regulations which we need to comply with provide protection in our community, but we also want to ensure our rules are proportionate, relevant, contemporary and ensure that the economy can grow.

The centrepiece of the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply was a digital health transformation. I found this quite extraordinary because I remember announcing our Digital Health Transformation Strategy three years ago, with a $476 million investment over 10 years. The Leader of the Opposition announced today what we have been doing for three years, in actual fact. He could not even find a new initiative.

What we are doing now will deliver better patient outcomes through system-wide digitally enabled technologies, meaning more Tasmanians can access health care sooner no matter where they live. The 2025-26 Budget is investing $112.8 million into digital health transformation, with a committed total investment of $476 million over a decade. Delivered so far has been: the Patient Alerts Management Solution (PAMS); our nation-leading e-referral system is available for 262 acute and community-based clinics; free public wi-fi is now available; discharge summary optimisation; the best possible medication history enhancement has been delivered across the four major hospitals, reducing the average wait time for patients receiving medications by 35 minutes. There is the 'Going Home' plan, the 'Did Not Attend' campaign, an electronic medical record (EMR) and electronic bill management system. This is happening, as our Health minister, Mrs Petrusma, highlighted during your contribution because she was no doubt gobsmacked by your complete falsehoods about there being a budget cut. There is no cut. That is completely wrong. Once again, you are caught red-handed not doing your homework.

We have an economy that is over $40 billion. It has grown enormously over the last 10 years because people have had the confidence to invest in this state, to put skin in the game and employ people - confidence they did not have prior to the election of a Liberal government in 2014. We have a workforce that has experienced nation-leading wage growth for an extended period. We have an all-time record for our unemployment rate, at 4.2 per cent or below, for three years. In 2013, the unemployment rate had an eight in front of it, to my memory. In the most recent data, we have the lowest unemployment rate in Tasmania's history, at 3.8 per cent. Our government, with the hard work, dedication and creativity of Tasmanian workers and businesses, has helped create this economy and we thank them. It continues to be strong, and we have many businesses and industries to thank for that. We have so much to celebrate. For anyone listening, in contrast to those listening to the Leader of the Opposition, we can be positive and proud of the state of Tasmania.

Our Budget is set against this background of a strong economy, which is necessary for significant investment in the essential services that respond to the needs and concerns of our community, that educate the next generation of Tasmanians, keep our community safe, continue to deliver jobs and build Tasmania to what it needs to be now and into the future. 

Our Budget focuses on the areas of priority needed to achieve this goal, with: a $14.5 billion investment into Health - a 12 per cent increase from last year and record investment, $10 million a day; $9.9 billion in Education, Children and Youth - an increase of 5 per cent to the last year's investment and a previous record at that; $3.8 billion for public order and safety because we listened to our community and what it needs; and, in order to build Tasmania now and into the future, $3.5 billion in infrastructure investment. We are also reaching in and supporting vulnerable Tasmanians with over $500 million for cost-of-living relief and support. This measured and responsible Budget backs business, creates jobs, supports families and builds stronger communities.

This government's record on health investment speaks for itself. Our healthcare system is for every Tasmanian across this wonderful state. That is why we are providing an additional $942 million in this Budget to meet increased demand for health and mental health services, a $10 million-a-day investment, whether it is for expanded services or new modes of care implemented to improve outcomes for Tasmanians. The uplift in this Budget will provide a broad range of hospital and ambulance services, along with additional support for community sector organisations to meet demand requirements. It also supports our efforts and commitment to attract and retain more nurses and midwives, continue primary care initiatives, including general practitioner programs and incentives, recruit more paramedics, deliver more oral health appointments, retain additional staff at emergency departments and enhance outpatient access. 

I am particularly pleased with our investment to increase the scope of practice in Tasmania to allow our well-trained pharmacists to treat people in their communities. This will make a difference to our GPs and our emergency departments. It will reduce presentations across the state in our emergency departments. 

Our government is also investing more than ever in mental health, responding to increasing statewide demand. In an area of particular importance to me, there is support for the Royal Hobart Mental Health Short Stay Unit, funding for the Alcohol and Other Drugs-related reform agenda, the new mental health hub in Devonport and the mental health precinct in north-west Tasmania, which I know our minister is so proud of. We will diligently build that infrastructure to support Tasmanians.

I will now refer to our nurses and midwives, general practitioners and paramedics. We have Tasmanian children right now who will grow up and become these people, providing critical services for the benefit of other Tasmanians. To equip our next generation of health professionals, as well as our tradespeople and teachers, with the skills they need to do these jobs, they need to have adequate learning environments and facilities. I understand this as a former education minister. I am proud of the fact that we are delivering $9.9 billion into education. There will be $297 million invested in our education facilities over the next four years. That means contemporary learning spaces and associated support spaces and amenities, the redevelopment of outdoor play areas, new gymnasiums, and traffic and carparking improvements in all schools across the state, whether that be Dodges Ferry, Rosetta, Exeter or Burnie.

We are investing across these primary schools, high schools and even new, super-sized early learning centres. I am passionate about this because when we came to government, classrooms were literally crumbling around the ears of our teachers and students. I was appalled at what I saw from right across this state. Tasman District School was an appalling example of that. That is why we are rebuilding schools across Tasmania, and committed to new schools for Legana and Brighton. Those opposite did not support the new Brighton High School, if my memory serves me correctly, which is shameful. That is a piece of intergenerational infrastructure that will support the learning of young people for years to come.

Through our efforts in negotiating the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement, we will see an additional $128 million delivered to our schools. Signing that historic agreement will see our schools supported more than ever before. Our 192 schools and just over 53,000 students, from prep to year 12, are already benefiting from this investment through actions including supercharging our successful Lifting Literacy initiative. There is nothing more important than education systems striving to lift literacy. It needs to be at the core of every single school and classroom. This additional funding will help drive our ambition for full literacy attainment. It means that we can supercharge our existing efforts to lift literacy initiatives and provide additional support to our frontline teachers to improve future learning outcomes and career choices - 100 per cent of a School Resource Standard (SRS) almost immediately, unlike other states, where the SRS will reach 100 per cent in the 2030s. 

Access to childcare is one of the many things Tasmanian families need to struggle and work through. We know many Tasmanian families are doing it tough - families and people who need to work a little bit more or a little bit longer to make ends meet. My team and I are well aware of that. We are committed to ensuring Tasmanians do not go without, ensuring that we are reaching in and supporting people who are dealing with living challenges. That is why this Budget continues the government's commitment to provide much-needed cost-of-living relief to Tasmanian families, with over $500 million of it.

Tasmanian school children will continue to receive half-price bus fares. This will also continue to apply for other regional routes. Every Tasmanian household will receive a $60 credit to their power bills thanks to our renewable energy dividend, providing energy and cost-relief to Tasmania during the colder winter months. We are delivering over $6.7 million in various food-relief programs all around the state.

Continuing our commitment to supporting our communities, we are delivering $3.8 billion to public order and safety and in recognition of the hard work and dedication of those on the frontline, we are providing an additional $58 million in support for injured workers, to ensure that those who experience injuries in the performance of their duties and efforts to keep our community safe are supported with timely and effective support for the duration of their recovery.

The honourable member who resumed his seat mentions trade. As Minister for Tourism and the Minister for Trade and Major Investment, the Tasmanian community, can I say, can be enormously proud. This Budget is delivered with a strong plan to build a more resilient Tasmanian economy, driven by innovation, underpinned by future-ready infrastructure and open to the world. Our economic success is not just measured in figures on a ledger; it is reflected in the determination of our small businesses, the growth of our regional industries and the world-class quality of Tasmanian products now reaching our global markets.

One of the most powerful drivers of Tasmania's economic momentum is the growing reach and reputation of our exports. That is why this Budget commits an additional $3 million to the next phase of our trade strategy, ensuring Tasmanian goods and services and expertise continue to thrive on the global stage because when our exporters succeed, Tasmanians all benefit.
This is not just a commitment for the future; it is recognition of the success that we are already seeing. Since launching our first Tasmanian Trade Strategy in 2019, exports have grown significantly. In the year to December 2024, Tasmanian goods exports grew to $4.51 billion with total exports, including services, rising to approximately over $6 billion. This is a remarkable billion-dollar boost to our economy since we launched the first-ever trade strategy in 2019.

Meanwhile, national goods exports fell by 7.3 per cent, just another example of strategic investment to ensure that Tasmania and Tasmanians punch above their scale, but also to the positive buck to the national trend, outperforming on the national stage. This strong economic performance is a testament to, of course, to the strong plan that we have, but backed up by the determination, quality and world-class capability of our producers, makers, growers and innovators and our exporters are not just holding their own, they are leading the way.

Our commitment to expanding Tasmania's global footprint is demonstrated through our Trade and Investment Mission Plan, which sets out missions to priority markets, diversifying partnerships and opening new doors for Tasmanian products and services. At the same time we are delivering an inbound visitation program, helping local businesses share their stories, their experiences, their providence and showcase their products to international buyers, investors, diplomats, influencers and journalists right here on Tasmanian soil, because there is no better stage than that of our own backyard to let the world experience what we have to offer.

We take great pride in the accomplishments of our exporters, and the world is waking up to the fact that we are not just on the map, we are in demand. Our wine sector is one such example, going from strength to strength. Research commissioned by Wine Tasmania shows our wine sector produces around $420 million in wine annually, with projections pointing at $2 billion by 2040 and that is a remarkable 376 per cent increase.

Over the past decade, our agricultural sector has grown to contribute over $1.5 billion annually to the local economy. Our farmers and producers are not only feeding global markets, they are strengthening regional communities, supporting thousands of local jobs and providing clean, sustainable production that can drive economic growth. From cherries and berries to beef and dairy, our products consistently command top prices thanks to our reputation for quality, our biosecurity, and our environmental integrity. With Tasmania now producing more than half of Australia's total cherry exports, it is also the nation's largest producer of raspberries and blackberries. That is something that we can all be very proud of.

Our defence industry is also advancing. Over the past five years, Tasmanian advanced manufacturing companies have secured more than half a billion dollars in defence contracts. The sector has tripled in size, with over 60 local businesses now actively engaged in the $2 trillion global defence industry.

Our exporters are more than just business success stories; they are ambassadors of Tasmanian excellence and the heartbeat of economic momentum. That is why we are investing, supporting and celebrating our exporters as they take Tasmania's reputation for quality and resilience in the world.

Our geographic and scientific strengths also present unique opportunities. Infrastructure is critical in enabling trade, and the recent $130 million upgrade to Hobart Airport's northern runway will support direct flights to the ASEAN region, cutting export transit times by up to 10 hours. It is expected to generate $122 million in tourism spending and create up to 1200 jobs.

Attracting and delivering major investment projects for Tasmania is also key to underpinning our economic future. These projects support local jobs, drive innovation, and build long-term resilience across our regions. From wind and hydrogen developments to luxury ecotourism and infrastructure upgrades, Tasmania is fast becoming a destination of choice for global investors. These projects do not just inject capital into our economy, they build capability, boost regional development, and position Tasmania as the forefront of clean, future-focused industries. I am very proud of that.

There is no greater supporter of a tourism industry than this Liberal government. Tasmania's visitor economy is one of our state's true success stories. Recent data -

[2.30 p.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, there is no greater supporter of the tourism industry than our Liberal government. Tasmania's visitor economy is one of our state's success stories. Recent data demonstrates that tourism growth is outpacing the state average in jobs and its contribution to gross state product, which we know now exceeds $40 billion in terms of our economy, which is fantastic. The sector can rightly be described as a jobs powerhouse. One in six jobs are in the tourism and hospitality industry in Tasmania, highlighting its importance and why we need to continue to support it. 

The Leader of the Opposition made his views known when it comes to the voucher system. Others in the community, those in rural and regional Tasmania, may disagree with him. This is a cost-of-living measure as well, when it comes to supporting Tasmanians during what are difficult times. It allows Tasmanians, in terms of tourism and hospitality, to thrive, earn an income and invest back in their own community. 

The Budget contains an additional $38 million to maintain tourism marketing over the next four years - some great campaigns: 'Job for a Day' campaign; Winter campaign; the 'Off Season' campaign from Tourism Tasmania is nothing short of fantastic. It is innovative, quirky and captures the imagination of those interstate who are coming here and spending their hard-earned dollars in this wonderful state of Tasmania. In fact, we welcomed 1.3 million interstate and international visitors last year. That is no surprise, given the wonderful assets we have: natural landscapes, world-class destinations attracting millions of locals and visitors every year to explore incredibly diverse coastlines, recreational and wilderness areas, and unique wildlife. They are a strong reason why the tourism industry currently injects more than $3 billion in visitor spending into the Tasmanian economy.

I mentioned additional investment in this space; strategic investment to elevate awareness and drive bookings, particularly in the winter months.  Our funding commitment will also support research into emerging consumer markets, and drive greater awareness and engagement with Tasmania's unique winter offerings, which is fantastic.

We welcome iconic events such as Dark Mofo and Taste of Summer, and the tremendous Festivale in northern Tasmania is fantastic. It is great for the economy. I commend all those involved, not only with those iconic events but also the smaller events. I just got the invitation the other day for the scallop festival in Bridport. Fairsy, Woody, and Fergy frequent the scallop festival at Bridport as members for Bass, and that is tremendous as well.

This government has embarked on an ambitious and inspiring capital investment program, and that is all around the state. We will always be proud of the investment we make in infrastructure, whether it is new classrooms or learning facilities, new mental health hubs or hospital redevelopments, or even our new roads, highways and bridges. There is a huge amount of effort going into this sort of enabling infrastructure to help build a better Tasmania now and for the future.

I have a limited amount of time, so I will make a few remarks on some key parts of enabling infrastructure, namely the new Bridgewater Bridge and Macquarie Point Stadium. Only on Sunday we opened the new Bridgewater Bridge. The Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, was there, as we said this morning. Who else - 12,000 Tasmanians were there as well to witness the opening of this new enabling infrastructure. How proud I was of the people who built that bridge - a long time coming and decades in the making. This government had the foresight and made the decision to build the Bridgewater Bridge and it is something that all those who worked on the bridge can be enormously proud of indeed.

This is infrastructure that improves travel times, increases safety and better connects the communities on either side of the bridge; infrastructure that created jobs and opportunities for Tasmanian workers; infrastructure that will make our economy more effective and efficient; and enabling infrastructure that will allow more Tasmanian families to spend more time with the people who they love as well. The new Bridgewater Bridge was the largest transport infrastructure project ever undertaken in Tasmania, and all Tasmania should be tremendously proud of what they achieved with this project, not in terms of the Budget itself, but what it represents: the hard work of thousands of Tasmanians and our Tasmanian workforce that I am tremendously proud of. It certainly does represent a big vote of confidence in Tasmania; what we can do, what we are able to achieve, and what we are able to build when we put our minds to it.

As we know, the stadium is one part of a broader mixed-use precinct that will transform Tasmania, creating jobs and economic activity. It will create thousands of jobs in its construction and operational phases, as well as the ongoing economic activity right across the state. We want to create more economic opportunities for Tasmanians in every single corner.

This government is transforming this industrial area that has been unutilised for decades. Of course, I am speaking of Macquarie Point. We are transforming it into significant enabling infrastructure for the benefit of a generation of Tasmanians. It has been sitting idle for far too long. I am proud of the fact that we have a vision to change that and the courage to make it happen. The project will supercharge the state's economy, create new jobs and be a catalyst for further investment and new opportunities. It will bring year-round activity that will lift all of Tasmania: concerts, major events, national and international sporting fixtures and conferences, delivering a steady stream of visitors and spending to our economy for generations to come.

I congratulate the Treasurer once again on the delivery of his first budget: a measured and responsible budget, a budget that delivers a sensible pathway to surplus, a budget that continues our commitment to the delivery of our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future, helping keep our economy strong; a budget that gets the balance right. This investment in this year's Budget reaffirms our commitment to building a better Tasmania now and into the future. I commend the Treasurer, and indeed, the bill to the House.

[2.38 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise on this Budget. I will start by saying that if you cannot manage the budget, you cannot govern this state in its best interests. On budget day, I labelled this Budget the worst budget in the state's history, and it was no exaggeration. This is the most unsustainable budget in the state's history.

As our leader stated before the break, we do not have confidence in this Premier. We do not believe Premier Rockliff and his new Treasurer, Guy Barnett, when they say they have a sensible pathway to surplus, because they do not. There is not one in the budget papers or in 2029-30, because this Budget is a house of cards built on unrealistic assumptions. Even if they did have a net operating balance surplus somewhere to be found, it would not necessarily stop the debt, because this government is racking up cash deficits like no government before it.

The cash flow statement in the Budget shows further deterioration of the cash position, with cash deficits totalling $5.1 billion over the four years to 2027-28. This is $441 million more than the Revised Estimates Report in February and $1.2 billion more than forecast in the budget last year. There is a further cash deficit of $498 million projected for 2028-29.

The cash position is used at a federal level, and at a state level there is a focus on the net operating balance. However, the net operating balance can give a very false impression of budget health, because it counts grants from the federal government for current or capital purposes as revenues but does not account for the corresponding outlays. This government talking about a sensible pathway to surplus for the net operating balance is trying to reassure Tasmanians there is not a problem when there is a massive one.

The cash flow statement records the government's cash receipts and payments, outlining how the government receives and spends cash. Until the cash position is returned to a surplus, debt is spiralling out of control at a rapid rate, and it will not stop under this government.

In this current financial year, they are setting a record cash deficit of close to $1.7 billion, followed by $1.4 billion for the next financial year and $1.3 billion for 2026-27. It is eye-watering stuff, especially for future generations of Tasmanians who will be paying this off through their hard work for a generation. The Liberal debt now equates to $47,000 for every household, and that figure will grow with every budget update. The tagline for this Budget should be: 'The Liberal Party is here for the now, and who gives a stuff about the future?'

When this government came to power, there was no net debt. They inherited $208 million of cash and investments in the bank. The Liberal legacy debt is now the biggest liability in the Budget, set to overtake the superannuation liability, which has peaked. Interest payments on the Liberal legacy debt will reach $650 million per year - there is more than $2 billion of interest payments across the forward Estimates, and that does not even pay it down. We will be spending more on interest payments than on ambulance services and emergency departments across Tasmania.

This absolute mess is being projected in this year's budget papers in the context of both major credit rating agencies downgrading Tasmania's credit outlook to negative following last year's horror budget. It is undeniable that this Budget has put Tasmania's credit rating at risk, which will see Tasmanians make even higher interest payments on the Liberal legacy debt.

Just a reminder for the House: last year, S&P warned Tasmania was heading for a weaker credit rating and the Liberals' budget was a frank admission that the state was going to breach all its own targets for fiscal management. They said Tasmania's fiscal metrics are weakening, noted our debt burden is rising, and warned that a credit rating downgrade would be implemented if debt reached 120 per cent of revenue. After the last budget, debt was projected to hit 119 per cent of revenue by 2027. 

Moody's' assessment was even worse. They predicted a rise in Tasmania's debt burden to around 168 per cent in the fiscal year ending June 2028, from 107 per cent in the fiscal year ending 2024. It will be very interesting, and no doubt concerning, to hear what the credit rating agencies say in the weeks and months ahead about the Budget, because it is now in an even worse position than it was last year. It is very clear that this Premier and this government cannot manage money and they have given up even trying.

I spoke at the start about this Budget being a house of cards built on unrealistic assumptions. Government expenditure forecast across the forward Estimates, for example, is flatlining at 0.3 per cent per annum over the four years to 2028-29.

Members on the other side like to talk about the 2013 budget and budgets from around that time. I wonder if they realise budget expenditures still grew by 0.8 per cent. They keep saying that they will not take a slash-and-burn approach, but if they can actually keep a budget, that is exactly what they would do with this set of numbers. At 0.3 per cent expenditure growth across the forwards, the Treasurer has set them and their departments a very tough ask.

In some of the out years, the government is predicting negative expenditure growth, which has never been done this century. It is clear they either plan on implementing bleak austerity - the worst in living memory - or they will blow the budget. We know with recent history it will be the latter, which is why the headline debt figures are actually worse than what is presented in the Budget.

This government will spend more than what they are accounting for in the Budget, and the net debt figure will continue to accelerate. If you do not believe me, just look at what happened this financial year. They were back in this place within six months with the credit card out asking for nearly half-a-billion dollars because they cannot deliver an honest budget, or keep one. They have no intention of doing that.

There are obvious, underestimated risks which demonstrate that in this Budget. In the wake of the ferry fiasco, we know a bailout for TT-Line is more than likely than not, and that is according to the chair of TASCORP. There is no mention of the ferry fiasco in the Budget or funding for a bailout, despite the cost at Devonport Berth 3 escalating from $90 million to $493 million, and that is on top of the secret payments to the shipbuilders or any further blowouts. That is information we had to extract out of that side because they have been less than transparent.

Another obvious one is wages policy. We know this government has wage agreements to sign across the public sector later this year, but the Budget sets a wages policy of 2.5 per cent. Do they honestly think they will keep negotiations at that level with inflation the way it has been in recent years? The Budget is a mess. It is not honest or achievable, and this government is making it worse with their proposed solutions.

Tasmania needs change because the Liberal Party cannot be trusted with the assets Tasmanians have built up over 100 years. The Premier walked into this place at the start of the year and said he had effectively bankrupted the state, and he needed to pay down the Liberal legacy debt by selling our power network, our public transport and our ports. Everything was for sale, he said, except for the Hydro. Since then he has broken that promise too, with Momentum still on the chopping block.

When you sell public assets, prices go up for Tasmanians, jobs go offshore and the dividends that help pay for schools and hospitals disappear. It is clear from the Budget the Liberals are hell-bent on selling the majority of energy assets. They are planning to privatise TasNetworks; Aurora; and Momentum Energy, which is a subsidiary of Hydro. That means privatising every power pole, every metre of electricity wire, every substation and those jobs, and every maintenance crew. Imagine what that would do to the cost of energy.

It means flogging off our energy retailer, and adding massive private profits to every power bill. It means selling Momentum, which is the energy retailer on the mainland that helps offset our power bills. Power prices will soar under the Premier's plan, just as they have in other states that have gone down this path.

The Premier is also planning to sell MAIB and Metro. That is bad news if you have a car or you catch the bus. It means higher bus fares, fewer routes, higher car registrations and more expensive insurance. Tasmanians will pay for every kilometre they travel on Tasmanian roads under the Premier's plans.

He also has TasPorts in his sights as well. We are an island state. It is madness. The ports are essential for nearly every aspect of our economy. It will mean every boat, every shipping container and every item on them will cost more in both directions, and that will mean higher prices for Tasmanian households and greater costs for our exporters.

They will not stop there. They have Sustainable Timber Tasmania on the chopping block. Tasmanian Irrigation is up for sale as well. These are companies that support jobs in regional areas and businesses, and it will decimate those industries - the forestry sector, the fire management and the emergency response and there will be fights over water like in other states, which will be imported into our agricultural sector.

Regional Tasmanians will pay the price for this government's terrible economic management. That is before we get to what it means for schools and hospitals. The Budget contains $620 million of revenue from businesses that the Premier is privatising. That is money that will no longer be available for schools and hospitals and construction projects because this premier will have sent it offshore instead. It is a massive black hole in their budget. It is why Tasmanians need change.
Any credibility they might have had managing the budget under premier Hodgman and treasurer Gutwein is gone. It is completely in tatters. It is why, if the crossbench continues to support the Rockliff Liberal government, we should, at the very least, put some accountability and transparency around their economic management. 

We stand at a critical crossroads in Tasmania's financial future. Our state's finances have deteriorated to a level that demands all of our attention. The independent review of Tasmania's state finances last year and the budget update since have painted a stark picture. Tasmania's financial position has declined so significantly that, in many respects, it is the worst in the nation. We face persistent deficits, escalating debt, and rising interest costs. Government spending has consistently exceeded revenue, driving us to an unsustainable financial path.

While extraordinary circumstances, such as COVID-19, the commission of inquiry compensation can justify temporary deficits, it is irresponsible to allow emergency-level, record deficits to continue unchecked. Tasmania deserves better. They have a right to know how their money is being spent, and our parliament must demand transparency and fiscal responsibility. Our proposal does not ban large deficits outright, but it does introduce a safeguard if the government intends to run a cash deficit exceeding 10 per cent of revenue, it must have obtained an approval for the Appropriation Bill for a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament.

This measure ensures accountability, forcing the government to justify borrowing that will impact future generations. Additionally, the Treasurer will be required to detail a report outlining the reasons for the estimated cash deficit, the expected timeframe in which the cash flow statement, specified in the budget or Estimates paper, is estimated to return to a cash surplus, the measures already taken or proposed to be taken to reduce unnecessary expenditure or to improve revenue in order to reduce the estimated cash deficit.

The bill also requires an examination of the budget papers by the auditor-general to ensure they have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and to independently verify if the assumptions are reasonable and accurately reflect government policy. There are new transparency rules for additional spending made outside the budget process. Within ten days of approval, the treasurer must publicly disclose the date, purpose, amount and impact of the extra spending on debt and deficit.

Tasmanian Labor stands committed to fiscal responsibility, transparency and accountability. Together we can stop the deficit and debt blowouts and restore financial stability to our great state. Last year, we announced a ten-point plan for budget repair. At the time, we acknowledged the scale of the problem and, importantly, that we were prepared to take the first steps while the Liberals pretended there was no budget crisis. This year, we build on this by proposing further measured savings and a demonstration of fiscal responsibility, but thanks to the mess Premier Rockliff has made of the state's finances, being responsible with the budget requires more than simply just not making things worse.

Being responsible means outlining an alternative to the Liberal's budget crisis. That is why, on day one, we will instruct government agencies to immediately abolish programs and positions that are not delivering good value for Tasmanians. The associate secretary roles created by the Premier will be axed as well as another 25 executive positions in the public service. This will save $8 million. Any business grants without a competitive process behind them will be cancelled, we will cut the number of government media advisers in half, saving $5 million over the forward Estimates, we will indefinitely defer the fifth lane on the Southern Outlet project and work with the federal government to reallocate their commitment to higher priority road projects, saving $160 million.

The Tourism Voucher Scheme is a waste of $10 million and is an example of Premier Rockliff's approach. He has not seen a problem he does not want to throw debt-funded taxpayer money at; that is his approach, and it is not sustainable. I know the Premier let the hospitality and tourism industry down with the ferry fiasco, but COVID-era stimulus programs are not the answer in a budget crisis. Also, we have Wilkinson's Point which was [Bookmark: Phr2_O=11.4_D=12.4_C=0.87]  public land granted without a discernible due process and $24 million of capital allocation when a lot of private other developers do not receive this sort of support and you have to ask why.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=25.7_D=14.6_C=0.63] We will put a hard cap on departmental spending on consultants, government advertising and travel, saving up to $60 million a year based on blowouts from last financial year, and to rein in the ballooning workers compensation bill and protect workers. We will modernise the complaints system [Bookmark: Phr4_O=40.9_D=6.2_C=0.72]  and reform return-to-work by centralising targeted support to avoid duplication across agencies.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=49.3_D=22.0_C=0.77] Recently, there was a consultant who was given more than $200,000 to write Tasmania's trade strategy. The whole section of State Growth dedicated to trade - it is called Trade Tasmania - has been tasked with doing that. 

We will abolish the Waste and Recovery Board, saving $1 million and change the law to end the requirement that landfill levy proceeds go to grant funds for composting and low priority projects. This will save $100 million over the forward Estimates. 

We will make the delivery of infrastructure projects on time and on budget, a key KPI for every department secretary, and Labor will establish an internal jobs market in the public service to allow jobs to be filled [Bookmark: Phr7_O=88.0_D=17.6_C=0.79]  permanently by existing state servants, without advertising or a full selection process. We will reorganise and re-prioritise the public service so it is more agile and able to deliver the services that Tasmanians rely upon. Our public servants are highly skilled and professional and we value them.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=106.9_D=29.4_C=0.83] These measures will save the budget more than half a billion dollars, and they are easily identified without the resources of government. The absurdity of the Treasurer, Guy Barnett, who needs to launch an efficiency unit of unelected bureaucrats against the Liberals' own 11-year-old government tells you that they do not want to do the hard work themselves or own the problem which is entirely down to their own policy decisions. It also tells Tasmanians that the ministers of the government have taken their eye off the ball and [Bookmark: Phr9_O=136.6_D=7.0_C=0.65]  there are government programs being delivered in their departments that are not value for money.

Whilst these savings we are identifying today as significant, they are only a start when it comes to addressing the budget problems created by this government. Tasmanians will be talking about this government's economic vandalism for a generation. Billion-dollar deficits, $11 billion worth of debt requires a long-term plan for budget responsibility. That is why we amended the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007 last week to ensure Treasury undertakes a long term assessment of the state's finances in every term of government. It is why [Bookmark: Phr11_O=173.0_D=20.1_C=0.80]  I have introduced the changes to the Financial Management Act 2016 and even the Constitution Act 1934 to expose budget blowouts, and cap deficits and return responsible budget management as a core responsibility of government. The fact that the Premier's railing against it tells you everything you need to know. The threshold is so high he wants to keep racking up record deficits unchecked. 

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=194.5_D=15.4_C=0.85] Responsible financial management will be non-negotiable in a future Labor government. Our policies outlined by our leader, Dean Winter, today show that we can be a government with new ideas that is willing to think creatively about our problems, and can be aggressive with the economy while being responsible with the budget.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=210.6_D=27.7_C=0.85] We need a government whose top priority is creating safe, secure, well-paid jobs. We need a government that will get developments and big projects moving. We need a government with a plan to modernise our health system. We need a government with a plan to fix the budget, and we need a government that will deliver economic growth in every corner of our state. 

A better future is possible than what is promised by this government, but only if we change the government first. With a change of government, I am positive about the future. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=239.1_D=9.2_C=0.76]  Between now and the next election, we will be announcing a significant number of additional policies to deliver the change that Tasmania needs. Labor has changed. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=248.6_D=4.4_C=0.81]  It is now up to the crossbench to see how long this Premier has left.

[2.57 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=255.7_D=5.8_C=0.87] Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Deputy Speaker, the Budget that the Treasurer delivered just last week [Bookmark: Phr17_O=262.4_D=27.1_C=0.86]  is a budget for now and the future. It is about building a better future for all Tasmanians. The people of Tasmania are entitled to hear what the opposition would propose instead. What we have is a political party that is still unable to administer itself. It is still under [Bookmark: Phr18_O=290.3_D=2.8_C=0.84]  federal jurisdiction and control [Bookmark: Phr19_O=293.8_D=11.2_C=0.77] , and the hapless Leader of the Opposition was foisted in to endorsement against the wishes of the Labor Party members of Tasmania by virtue of a federal executive determination. That gives you a bit of an insight into why the Labor party has now finally changed its mind in relation to the stadium. You had the Prime Minister of Australia committing $240 million to a precinct - the highest amount, other than for Olympics, that a federal government has ever provided to a state government for a facility such as we are proposing. We had Labor opposing and opposing and finally, undoubtedly, the federal administration reminding Mr Winter that he was only in parliament courtesy of its intervention, and that he would have to develop a policy in support of the stadium.

However, the centrepiece of the budget reply was to bully the crossbench. If anything, the crossbench is now genuinely cross because that is no way to treat the crossbench. We also know that this no-confidence motion allegedly on the table can only get through this place with the support of - you guessed it - the Greens. We have Labor willing and angling for Greens support. They are going get the show together again, the Greens and Labor, and we know the devastation that causes. The last time Labor and the Greens were in power together, we were in recession and unemployment had an eight in front of it. Today it is a three and we have the highest business confidence in the country. Does that happen by accident or by good, sound economic management with a pathway to surplus?

We have heard the Leader of the Opposition tell us day after day that the government has, allegedly, no pathway to surplus. Park that for a moment. Did the Leader of the Opposition in his speech today outline his pathway to surplus? Not a word. That which he criticises the government for incorrectly he is unable to provide himself. That is the shallowness and hollowness of the Labor party's presentation today. The Leader of the Opposition's speech reminded me of the Greens' budget reply last year, where they were going to increase taxes on fish farms then abolish them in the next breath. Somehow, the increase in taxation of the non-existent fish farms was going to fund all the Greens' promises. 

Labor is now saying that it is going to rip bigger dividends out of the government business enterprises. Read 'tax increase', by another name, because who pays for the instrumentalities? It is the people of Tasmania. Not only does he tell us that he is going to lift more money out of them, he then hectors and lectures, and says we ought to be giving more discounts to the major industrials and others. How does that work? If they have to give away more of their money, how are you going to lift greater profits out of them? It just does not add up. This is the sort of voodoo economics you might expect from the Greens. That it is now being adopted by Labor is a matter of great concern. If Labor had its way, that would see an increase in the cost of living for every man, woman and child in Tasmania, with increased power bills.

We also have the duplicity of the Leader of the Opposition. If it is not good enough to be told that he has been born in three separate places, we now have him appearing on Leon Compton telling the people of Tasmania that pork-barrelling will stop. That was to his southern audience. The very next day, he is on the front page of The Examiner with a $20 million pork-barrel for Bass. I do not mind if you say that you want to spend money, but do not speak out of one side of your mouth and then the very next day speak out of the other side. It now seems that if the Liberals put forward a policy, as of definition by Mr Winter, it must be 'pork-barrelling', whereas if Mr Winter puts forward a proposal, it is somehow visionary and good. What you need in this economic debate is consistency and integrity but that is what the Leader of the Opposition lacks, especially when he comes in here day after day railing against that which he is used to champion - privatisation. 

What our fellow Tasmanians want is integrity and consistency of message, something the Leader of the Opposition has dismally failed to achieve. We have, courtesy of our successive budgets that have allegedly 'wrecked the economy', according to the Leader of the Opposition, but delivered the highest business confidence in the state. Well, I am sorry, the two do not match up, do they? If the economy is wrecked, one would not expect there to be such high business confidence. If the economy is wrecked, how is it that we only have 3.8 per cent unemployment? If 3.8 per cent unemployment is indicative of a wrecked economy, could those opposite tell this House what it means for the economy if the unemployment rate has an eight in front of it? It would have been more than wrecked. It would be devastated not to be recovered. Yet, because of the determination of my colleagues over the years, we have restored that eight-point something per cent unemployment right down to three-point something.

We have lifted that Tasmanian economy from a recession courtesy of Labor and the Greens to having the highest business confidence in the country. These are things that the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow treasurer cannot simply sweep under the carpet. They are facts. 

What is more, the Leader of the Opposition says he wants jobs with high wages. I have news for him: we have the highest wage growth in the country. Yet again, indicative of a wrecked economy, I suppose. Yet, when you read the Australian Financial Review - I think it was this morning - Australia has the biggest decline in wages in the western world. Here we are overcoming the national trend and leading the nation with genuine high wage growth.

I say to the Leader of the Opposition, when he relentlessly gets up Question Time after Question Time to assert that the economy is wrecked, that mere repetition does not turn it into effect. It might be a good propaganda tactic, but when you have situations of the lowest unemployment rate in the country, the highest wages growth in the country, the highest business confidence in the country, what a great trifecta to have. Instead, he says that the economy is burnt, it is wrecked, and there is no way out. 

We then hear the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow treasurer tell us about the evil of asset sales and what it would mean to the economy. We have not committed to any actual specific sale. What we have said is that we are looking to ascertain how our business enterprises can work and be the most effective for the benefit of the people of Tasmania. 

Who sold the Hobart Airport? There is no answer for that rhetorical question, and not only because it be against standing orders to interject, Deputy Speaker. The members opposite know it was them who sold the Hobart Airport. Did that devastate the tourist industry? We have seen a great influx of tourists into Tasmania. We have seen Hobart Airport now with private capital going forward with a $200-million expansion.

What I would say to those members is, have a look at what you did whilst in government, and - I will give credit where it is due - the benefits that flowed from it. If you recognise the benefits from your sales, please have the decency, the integrity, the consistency to acknowledge that the same might flow - and I underline the word 'might' - should we go down that path. Whether we do or not still, of course, remains to be seen.

When Labor rail against the debt, can I ask them: what program would they have cut? What small business would they have not assisted? What would they have done during COVID? We know that the debt situation we have is a COVID legacy, and we are now, in a strategic way, cutting the deficit each year to get to a surplus. That is our pathway to surplus. Most people understand that and know that. What you can do is have a complete slash and burn, as Labor and the Greens tried to do in their last few desperate days of government, and completely and utterly wreck the economy.

One thing I will agree with the Leader of the Opposition on is that Tasmania needs a change - Tasmania needs a change in the approach taken by the opposition. This relentless negativity, always talking Tasmania down, will do damage - and the reason it does not do damage is because nobody takes Labor seriously. If they were to take Labor seriously, it would be highly damaging to our economy, to investment, and for people coming to this state to work.

It was interesting that the interest bill - which, yes, we are working on, and that is why we are seeking to reduce deficits and get a pathway to surplus - the Leader of the Opposition spent that money not once, not twice, not three times. I think I counted six ways he said the money could be spent. That is not leadership. Leadership would be to say, 'We will spend it on this one issue or over these issues', but dedicate the amount. This broad brush approach that somehow, 'Yes we will satisfy Health and Education' - whilst I am on health, with the Minister for Health in the House: what a faux pas to say that we will make a saving from a fund that has already been spent. This is the economic illiteracy and the incapacity of the Leader of the Opposition. It is very unusual for the Minister for Health to interject, but for her to interject, and as loudly as she did, was indicative of the outrage that she felt and quite rightly expressed, and indicative of the complete ignorance and incapacity of the Leader of the Opposition to understand what is happening.

Also in Health, the transitional fund - minister, $436 million over 10 years?

Mrs Petrusma - Yes, for the IT Digital Health Transformation.
Mr ABETZ - For the IT, yes. He is going to do it. It has already been underway for three years, but now the Leader of the Opposition has finally found it, and he is going to implement a policy that has already been going for 10 years and has had an allocation made available to it. Then, he had the audacity to tell us that nothing has been done. If you do not attend the bridge opening on Sunday, you can turn a blind eye to that major piece of infrastructure -

Ms Butler - You did not invite us to the official opening. You are so full of it. You know no one from our team was invited to that.

Ms Haddad - That is rich. Very rude not to invite us.

Mr ABETZ - and somebody says he was not invited. I do not blame the Prime Minister for not inviting him -

Ms Butler - No, it was your department that did the invitations, and you know it.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ABETZ - It was open to the public, and 12,000 people came along without the need for a special invitation.

Ms Butler - Yes, like me.

Mr ABETZ - We were told that there is nothing new. Well, there is the bridge. Before that, the brand new school at Brighton, the brand new school at Legana, and the new intersection at the end of the Southern Expressway in Davey Street, which has helped the traffic flow to be able to enter the city. Now the former mayor of Kingsborough says he is going stop the fifth lane on the Southern Expressway. I can now understand why the Labor party membership thought that he was not necessarily a good choice for endorsement, because I do not think that will go down very well.

Then the flip-flopping; who was against the new Spirits? It was Labor. They opposed it. They took it off the agenda, and now they are saying they could do so much better than the government. Well, sorry, not your idea, not what you wanted to do. You tried to oppose it. We are nearly there now and here they are, seeking to condemn it. What is worse is Mr Winter thinking that he knows better than the new management of TT-Line in relation to today's sailings.

They are done on the basis of demand and requirement and cost recovery, and to seek to foist a whole lot of day sailings will also have a workplace relations issues, which the Labor party pay lip service to but do not actually care. Then we have the Office of the Coordinator-General - another policy where they initially said they would abolish the Office of the Coordinator-General. Today, they want a bigger and expanded Office of the Coordinator-General. I do not really care which way you go, but please do not flip-flop, because it is starting to tax my brain to know what your policy is on anything. Trying to keep up is a full-time job and I find it, I must say, exceptionally difficult.

We are now being told that Labor has changed, but one thing we were not told is what has Labor changed from and to. That is what I want to hear. Was it because they were against the Spirits and now in favour; they were against the Office of the Coordinator-General and now they want it bigger and better? There are so many contradictions - against privatisation and now for privatisation, or the other way round. Help me, Deputy Speaker, it becomes so confusing trying to know what the Labor Party is on about. Here we are with the centrepiece of the alternative budget being a proposal of a no-confidence motion in the government.

You know what that will do? If that got carried, the parliament would be adjourned, there would be an election, the stadium legislation would not get through and we would then be out of the timelines that are so needed. The legislation I tabled this morning would unfortunately not be able to be considered, and I trust that is not what the Labor party actually wants in their mischievous placement of this no-confidence motion.

What I would say to the people of Tasmania is that we have had a good budget delivered by a good treasurer, which is building now and for the future.

[3.17 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, what a contribution from a senior minister of this government. I am gobsmacked. All he has done is talk about us, not about his budget nor his government. He certainly has not backed in the Premier, now that there is a no-confidence motion on the table here in the parliament. It is extraordinary - and to say that we are embarrassing Tasmania.

This government has made Tasmania an international embarrassment when it comes to the ferry fiasco. That will stay with this government forever, marked in history. To say that we are an embarrassment is simply not on, when you have done that to Tasmania and to Tasmanians and to our international reputation.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=11.2_D=15.3_C=0.85] Our state is at a critical juncture. After 11 years of incompetent Liberal government, we are facing an unprecedented budget crisis with debt and deficit as far as the eye can see. To make matters worse, we have a Premier [Bookmark: Phr3_O=26.9_D=14.6_C=0.84]  and minority government who have simply given up. They have given up on trying to manage the budget, given up on trying to improve education and health and essential services in this state, and despite their rhetoric they have no plan for the future of Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=42.0_D=29.1_C=0.83] The lazy Liberals - the Liberals' slogans and commitments to, above all else, putting the Liberal party before the state of Tasmania and our fellow Tasmanians have finally caught up with them. Unfortunately, it is future generations of Tasmanians, my children and those of many others of us here in this place, who will ultimately pay for the reckless spending and dishonesty of the Liberals [Bookmark: Phr5_O=71.5_D=26.1_C=0.86] , and that is a disgrace.

Early election after early election, broken promise after broken promise, project mismanagement followed by budget blowouts. There has been a litany of waste and poor policy decisions taken by the Liberals, all characterised by the one thing that they have been consistent in all along, and that is incompetence [Bookmark: Phr6_O=98.5_D=7.3_C=0.75] . The frightening thing though, and even more frightening than the record $11 billion of net debt and billion-dollar deficits [Bookmark: Phr7_O=106.1_D=28.0_C=0.82] , is the fact that Premier Jeremy Rockliff and his minority government have no cognisance of the seriousness of this, nor a plan to fix our budget. They parrot their mythical pathway to surplus. I think they might believe it, but I am pretty sure that nobody else does. The mythical pathway to surplus is underpinned by privatisation, asset sales, public sector job cuts and loads of spin and very little details.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=134.6_D=6.0_C=0.77] The simple fact is Jeremy Rockliff cannot manage money and the Liberals cannot be trusted. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=142.4_D=23.7_C=0.79]  It feels like the Premier, Jeremy Rockliff, is waiting for his record $11 billion of net debt and billion-dollar deficits to be someone else's problem. Let us not forget he has delivered the three biggest deficits in history. It is incredibly serious, and it worries me when we have an opposition and a crossbench who are more concerned about our fiscal position than the government of the day.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=166.9_D=14.3_C=0.82] This Budget marks another dark day for Tasmania, off the back of another dark day, and there have been a few, according to the TCCI, but I want to reflect on a day that Tasmanian business leaders declared it would be hard to ever trust this government again [Bookmark: Phr11_O=181.5_D=29.9_C=0.82]  and a project that is emblematic of the character of this government incompetence writ large. This extraordinary declaration followed the delays and cost blowouts to berth 3, the failed berth 1 proposal. Does everyone remember that? Our new billion-dollar were ships being stored overseas and looked at by the Scottish Government for a humanitarian effort housing refugees. Oh, hang on a minute - the Scottish Government did not know anything about it. That is right, it was just another [Bookmark: Phr12_O=211.5_D=28.4_C=0.78]  mythical fantasy from this government. 

The latest in this debacle is the re-announcement of a date of 26 October for berth 3 to be built, being decried by the minister who has now left the House as a great day for Tasmania. What fake news - 26 October was always stated as the earliest timeframe. The Spirits are six years late, $500 million over budget and each time they are delayed there is a half-a-billion dollar hit to our economy [Bookmark: Phr13_O=240.3_D=29.7_C=0.82] . The latest in a long line of failures is the fact that Spirit IV has a defect only detected in sea trials for Spirit V. If it was not for bad weather, Spirit IV would have been on the high seas, putting its workforce at risk. 

This is a minority government that has completely lost control of the delivery of major projects in this state. This is evidenced through the stadium project, the ferry fiasco and the AFL High Performance Centre at Kingston, just to name a few [Bookmark: Phr14_O=270.4_D=2.0_C=0.90]  more high-profile projects. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=273.3_D=8.3_C=0.88]  The Liberals were too busy calling an early election for their own political survival to make sure that they had had a berth ready for Spirit IV to arrive.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=282.8_D=8.5_C=0.81] The High Performance Centre in Kingston has hit a cost blowout, with the estimated budget increasing from $70 million to $115 million [Bookmark: Phr17_O=292.8_D=12.2_C=0.80]  and that is without the ancillary infrastructure, which we still do not know how much is going to cost. That includes club rooms for existing cricket and football clubs, road construction to the new site, the relocation of a dog-walking area and a mountain bike park. The Kingborough Council, quite rightly, have declared that they will not be paying for this ancillary infrastructure, neither should they. What is the exact cost of these ancillary projects? Why have they not been publicly disclosed? I ask the Premier to, again, be honest about the cost of this project with Tasmanians.

Minister Abetz was recently quoted during Premier and Cabinet (PAC) hearings describing the initial budgeted cost of berth 3 at $90 million as 'fanciful', and criticised past management for excessive optimism and under-pricing essential project items. Deputy Speaker, I say to you and to the House, is it no wonder that the former infrastructure minister, Michael Ferguson, is so prickly back there on the backbench, and did it ever occur to anyone to maybe tell him that $90 million was fanciful throughout this whole debacle?

Tasmanians have come to accept begrudgingly that there will be stuff-ups, which I am very sad to say, and cost blowouts and delays to major projects in their state, but at the very least they deserve, and they just want, this government to be honest with them about these cost blowouts and delays. I say to the Premier: 'Not a red cent more'. Does that sound familiar?

We have a premier who changes his focus and agenda for our state like he changes his socks or maybe more frequently, who knows? There is a void of any type of leadership across any major issue in this state and that void is entirely of the Premier's own making. The Premier said, and I quote, when he commenced his premiership that he 'wanted to lead a government with heart.' However, he has dropped his progressive agenda and he is about to privatise Tasmania's public transport, ports and power companies, which will lead to increased prices, poorer services and less money for hospitals and schools. That is heartless. He launched a pothole blitz, patched one just up the road from his farm and then promptly forgot about his plan to fix Tasmanian roads for the future.

He launched a red tape reduction blitz, even though he had a Red Tape Reduction Coordinator, for the last 11 years, I might add. What has this government been doing? He says he is going to get on with the job when it comes to the Spirits, but he gave the job to someone else: minister Abetz and minister Vincent. He says he is going to merge our GBEs, only to cancel that because it is anti-competitive, something that we knew right from the beginning. He said he is going to ban ambulance ramping, but he has only moved the problem to emergency departments; people are still waiting hours for an ambulance. Incidentally, just for the record, we are going to be spending more on interest payments than on ambulances and emergency departments combined. I say 'shame' to that.

The cable car on Kunanyi, local government reform, another $3 million wasted, Development Assessment Panels (DAPs), threats to the Legislative Council and local government - that went well, and now you have to come back for a second crack at that one. That is all because of your failed planning reforms. One of my favourites, the old stability clause, where Jeremy Rockliff said, 

If re-elected, we will amend section 34 of the Constitution Act 1934 to provide that if an elected member ceases to be a parliamentary member of the political party for which they are elected, then their seat becomes vacant and a recount occurs. This will result in a member of the party for which they were first elected replacing them and would restore the proportionality of the parliament as chosen by the voters. 

This new stability clause makes it certain that if Tasmanians vote for a majority Rockliff Liberal government this Saturday, they will get a majority Rockliff Liberal government. 

There is another one, never heard of again. That is right, his government would have fallen because of the ex-Lambies, and we did not get a majority government either. We got Jeremy Rockliff's coalition of chaos that has wrecked business confidence in this state and the Roy Morgan is proof of that. 

He said that he would privatise our assets and our GBEs despite both Houses of this parliament voting against this plan. These are assets that Tasmanians have spent hundreds of years building up: our government business enterprises that provide valuable revenue for Tasmanian schools and hospitals. 

Then there is the Project of State Significance (POSS) process. As a means of managing internal discontent in his party again, he agreed to that process, but that has become too hard, so he abandoned that. The moral of the story is, and this is the problem; when the going gets tough, premier Jeremy Rockliff gives up, whacks a bit more debt on the never-never and the circus rolls on.

Every decision this government has made has had economic consequences for Tasmania and those costs have taken a toll. The Liberals have effectively blown the budget. In fact, this power-at-any-cost mentality dates right back to 2018. It is a fact. Saul Eslake confirms that in his Independent Review of Tasmania's State Finances. Mr Eslake states that there is a direct correlation between the policies and fiscal decisions made and taken by this Liberal government.

This, of course, has been exacerbated by consecutive unnecessary early elections and a long list of election commitments. The latest early elections saw Tasmanians pay for 480 new spending promises the Liberals made to buy their way back into government.

The problem we have in Tasmania is that we have a government that over 11 years have claimed to be astute budget and economic managers, all the while spending beyond their means like drunken sailors, raking up debt and deficit and at the same time running our state's essential services into the ground. They were able to convince Tasmanians that they had things in hand for a while, but they have lost their discipline and it is all unravelling.

The facts speak for themselves. Taxpayer money spent on interest payments will soon overtake the government's spending on ambulances and emergency departments combined. When the Liberals came to office in 2014, Tasmania had $208 million in the bank. Now, after 11 years of Liberal budget mismanagement, Tasmania is staring down the barrel of almost $11 billion worth of net debt. The interest payments on the Liberal legacy debt will reach $650 million per year, more than $2 billion across the forward Estimates, and that will not even start to pay it down.

Tasmania is in this situation solely because of the wasteful spending and incompetence of the Liberals. The new Spirits project alone is half a billion dollars over budget and is costing our economy $500 million a year while they are not operating. They are six years late and berth 3 is $400 million over budget. 

If you cannot manage the budget, you cannot govern Tasmania. The results of having the Liberals in charge for 11 years speak for themselves. Tasmania's finances have never been worse. The Liberals have shredded any budget management credibility they once had and this disastrous situation we find ourselves in has left some saying that we may even need a bailout. It is extraordinary.

Instead of quoting what others have said about this budget or about budget management, I might just quote a couple of things that have been said by members of this government. Minister Eric Abetz in his inaugural speech said that the current debt levels are distressing and require tough decisions for the genuine welfare of next generations. He also said:

Maintaining our lifestyle today at the expense of the next generation is intergenerational theft and selfishness writ large.

The question to minister Abetz is: what is he going to do about these concerns? Quite obviously, he does not have the ear of the Premier or the Treasurer, given this budget that has been handed down. Well, those concerns would have been allayed. Would he like the Treasury portfolio - or maybe the Premier's job before things get worse?

Even the Premier himself in 2011 in this place said:

Tasmanians should not become the victims of financial mismanagement … It is not their fault that this incompetent Government has been irresponsible with taxpayers' dollars and massively overspent in each of its last seven budgets.

I want to remind the Premier today again in this place that the budget he presented on Thursday includes 10 cash deficits in a row and no credible pathway to surplus. I wonder if he stands by his comments.

Then there is minister Felix Ellis. Does he want the Treasurer's or the Premier's job? It seemed like it during his audition at the TCCI budget event in Ulverstone last week. He was actually more convincing than the Treasurer at times. He needs to remember that he is part of this government. He had a short stint out but he made sure that he was back here moving Joan Rylah on to enable that to happen.

I agree with Minister Ellis that population, participation, and productivity are our headline challenges in the Tasmanian economy. My question to him, as wannabe treasurer or premier is: what is he going to do about those issues?

Deputy Leader, they are lining up on that side. If the nervous laughter on the other side of the House during our leader Dean Winter's speech is anything to go by, they know they are in trouble. We are not issuing a threat to the crossbench. We have laid down the gauntlet to the Premier. He has given up and we have no confidence in him.

A budget is a set of numbers on a page outlining spending expectations. It should be aligned to the values and strategic direction of the government of the day. It should be a clear and honest set of numbers and plan for the future infrastructure and service needs of our state. It should include and deliver on election commitments in a reasonable period of time. This set of numbers before us tells a story and this year's Budget tells a story of a minority government on a day-by-day proposition that has given up on the future.

I have two problems with the title of this year's Budget, 'Building a better Tasmania: Now, and for the future.' The first one is that there are very few new infrastructure projects in the Budget, and those that are there continue to be delayed and pushed out into the forward Estimates. I will cover a few of those projects that have dropped off the radar for this government. It is important to mention those today:

Cradle Mountain Cableway

Underground bus mall

Tamar Bridge

Light rail by 2025

The northern prison

Four-lane Midland Highway

Sealing of the Western Explorer

The second crossing across the Cam River.

The government has blown the budget, and it is clear we cannot afford these things. 

The second point is that we are saddling the next generation with debt, which is hardly 'building a better future' for young Tasmanians.

The opening of the Bridgewater Bridge on the weekend marks the end of the state's largest infrastructure project. What is next? The stadium, for all that has been said, is another major infrastructure project. There are no cranes on the skyline in Hobart, or other parts of the state. If you speak to builders from local construction companies and civil contractors, they all tell us that they do better when there is a big infrastructure project in town and in the pipeline, and at the moment they cannot see that from this government. We need the jobs and we need the economic activity. 

When the economy is going well, the government claims it is responsible and links that to its endeavours and achievements. When the economy is not going so well, it is always someone else's fault. This Liberal minority government's budget mismanagement is starting to impact Tasmania's economy, despite the rhetoric.

Labor is back and we want to get Tasmania moving. We will be responsible with the budget and ambitious with the economy. Our policies are in line with those core values, and our core value of creating safe, well-paid, secure jobs for Tasmanians no matter where they live, even in the regions. I commend our leader, Dean Winter, for his budget reply speech to the House today. I thought it was outstanding. The policies we have announced to date are equally outstanding. 

One I will touch on is childcare for the regions. If we want to talk about productivity, participation and population being key parts of a successful economy, we have to talk about childcare. It is a significant barrier to participation and a significant barrier to productivity, particularly in those areas where there is market failure. Therefore, I am proud to be part of a team that is supporting the regions, namely the west coast, by providing support for childcare where there is market failure. 

Another point I will make is about the northern conference centre. This has been talked about a lot in the north and talked about a lot by the government. I believe they have done some feasibility studies, However, they have really done nothing to progress this important project for the north. I am pleased and proud that it is included in our budget reply today.

I was in Adelaide a few weekends ago, and Adelaide is moving. There is an air of confidence in and around the city, and people are in great spirits. I came away thinking about the fact that I have not seen that type of excitement or economic activity in Tasmania for quite a while. I am pleased that with Invest Tasmania, which builds on the work done in South Australia with Invest South Australia, we are bringing that policy to Tasmania. That could bring great economic and community and social benefits to our state.

The last thing I will touch on is our policy on modernising the health system. I received some correspondence from a registered nurse working in our health system who talked about recruitment issues which lead to short-staffing pressures and antiquated recruitment processes. The policy we have announced today about the modernisation of the health system would streamline some of these processes and mean that essential gaps are filled across our public service. I will speak about this further on the adjournment because it is something I feel strongly about.

In conclusion, we have put the Premier on notice. 

Time expired.

[3.37 p.m.]
Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Housing, Planning and Consumer Affairs) - Honourable Speaker, it is clear from the Budget delivered by the Treasurer last week that this is a vision that will set Tasmania up for the decades ahead. We have seen the effects of sound financial management and good management of the economy that has delivered extraordinary results for the Tasmanian community. Tasmanians out there who live in the real world know of an economy where we have record low unemployment in this state. We have had the lowest unemployment in the country and we continue to deliver the highest business confidence of any state in Australia. Wage growth is the highest of any state in Australia. It is clear that those are opportunities that Tasmanians and Tasmanian young people have not seen in many years [Bookmark: Phr2_O=18.1_D=30.0_C=0.82] . 

Because of this government's investment, because we are investing in the human capital that will help drive this state forward through the Budget, we are going be able to break the cycle of intergenerational disadvantage that affects too many homes in Tasmania and has affected them for decades. We are investing in the human capital that will transform - the education, skills opportunities and health care people need so that they can live an even better life. That will ensure Tasman [Bookmark: Phr3_O=48.5_D=29.8_C=0.84] ians are able to build upon the momentum we have seen in the last 10 years to create something extraordinary in this state. We have huge opportunities because we are a small, connected state. We have the ability to break down some of the barriers in years past, including our challenges of distance and communication, and a whole range of other matters that have been part of Tasmania's economic gravity for generations. Those things are starting to change.

However, we need [Bookmark: Phr4_O=78.3_D=29.5_C=0.83]  to make the bold investments, to have confidence not just in our economy but confidence in ourselves to make these kinds of investments that can really transform the life chances of Tasmanians, young and old. We have seen from the Bridgewater Bridge and incredible projects like that what can happen when young Tasmanians are able to get an apprenticeship and break the cycle of disadvantage. There will be young people living on the eastern shore, in Bridgewater and other suburbs in that local area, who have been able to [Bookmark: Phr5_O=108.4_D=26.9_C=0.73]  aspire to be part of our incredible civil construction sector when perhaps they have not had economic opportunities in their homes in generations. They have been able to fundamentally transform their life chances because the work is there, the opportunities are there, and the training is there. That is what this Budget is about writ large. It is not just about one project. It is about the way we invest in our communities right around the state.
 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=135.8_D=5.0_C=0.77] Of course, this Budget increases the borrowings. We have to do that, but that makes sense [Bookmark: Phr7_O=141.1_D=24.9_C=0.88]  because Tasmanians want to see us invest now to break the cycle, to create opportunities for our young people and to transform those life chances. If we can do this now, if we can have the confidence in ourselves, then we can do something truly extraordinary in this state. I believe it is something of pride to all Tasmanians. It is a budget that is delivering for [Bookmark: Phr8_O=166.9_D=3.6_C=0.86]  this generation and for future generations on the fundamental needs they have [Bookmark: Phr9_O=170.9_D=30.0_C=0.77] . 

Back 50 years ago, Eric Reece borrowed significantly to help build the hydro scheme. That was at a time when the economy was essentially energy and electricity. Now, this is a government that is investing in the human capital we need with an economy that is 70 per cent services. It is about what we invest in Tasmanians, in our people, so that we can help to lift them up and lift up the generations to come. 

What I saw on the other side was an embarrassment [Bookmark: Phr10_O=201.1_D=29.9_C=0.86] , a speech that has again failed to deliver an alternative budget. We call this Alternative Budget Day, but for the 11th year in a row the opposition has squibbed it. They do not have the confidence in themselves to deliver a sound economic prescription for the future of our state, and no wonder. Last time they tried to put a few numbers on paper in a shiny red book, it turned into one of the biggest disasters of the last [Bookmark: Phr11_O=231.3_D=29.1_C=0.77]  election. It cost then-shadow treasurer Dr Broad his position and it was clearly a huge drag on the Labor vote. They do not have the confidence in themselves, their party does not have the confidence in them and would not let them put their hands up for government at the at the end of the last election. The Labor party believed that the Labor party could not govern then, and they have shown nothing in the last 12 months to show [Bookmark: Phr12_O=260.6_D=29.7_C=0.77]  why they should be able to govern now.

One of the most telling things about the opposition leader's response to the Budget - his reply, as we had no alternative budget - was that he has now proposed to do a deal with the Greens on the floor of this parliament for power. It is clear that this is what he has proposed, despite saying that Labor has changed. Labor is not back - they are just backstabbing. It is clear that [Bookmark: Phr13_O=290.7_D=14.3_C=0.77]  their approach, their only path to government, was not a message of hope, opportunity and financial management. It was a promise to return to the dark days of 2010-2014 - of doing a deal with the Greens. That is literally what they proposed to us in the Leader's budget reply today: that they would team up with the Greens and whoever else might perhaps be interested to try to steal government in this state. That is, frankly, a disgrace. I know Dr Broad will have to account to his community after today and go back to the [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=29.6_C=0.75]  north-west and say why it was that he and Labor have again proposed to try and get the numbers together with the Greens. We do not know why, and quite clearly Labor has not changed. 

Quite clearly it is all talk, because if they were serious about change, they would act as a responsible opposition and get focused on delivering numbers that Tasmanians can rely on, rather than playing silly political [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.5_D=9.8_C=0.72]  parlour games, or even worse, very serious political parlour games to try to wrest control of this parliament and this state in partnership with the Greens.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=71.0_D=29.4_C=0.81] I will talk specifically about some of the opportunities that have arisen because of this Budget, particularly in the areas of my portfolio. Quite clearly our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future was about delivering opportunities for Tasmanians, and there is a no more important space than skills and training and the jobs agenda that we have. I am pleased to know that the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party was paying attention at the budget roadshow [Bookmark: Phr5_O=100.8_D=29.8_C=0.84]  the other night, because this government has a clear agenda when it comes to productivity, participation and population. 
We want to ensure that young people have the tools they need to take part in our growing economy. We have record low unemployment in Tasmania. In years past it has been assumed that Tasmanian young people have been participating at a lower rate in the economy because there was not opportunity under governments like Labor and the Greens. Now, it is clear that there are economic opportunities, with high wage growth, low unemployment, great business confidence and growing retail trade in particular, but we are still seeing a higher rate of non-participation in the economy. That is why it is important that we start making some of the game-changing investments that can help break down the barriers that young people might have to getting into the economic life of our society. 

We have seen massive investments - $118 million invested [Bookmark: Phr7_O=161.0_D=30.0_C=0.76]  into TAFE facilities and TAFE opportunities around our state. A new Water and Energy Trade Centre of Excellence is now being complemented by a North West Clean Energy Centre of Excellence based in Burnie, right next to our new Youth to Independence facility, right next to high school education facilities. Young people in our state, in our community can see that pipeline of opportunity coming through, not just of civil construction work in the renewable energy sector [Bookmark: Phr8_O=191.3_D=29.8_C=0.81] , but the pipeline of opportunity that can come through as part of their life and aspirations so that they can continue to live, work and, in the future, raise a family in Tasmania. 

That is a $27-million investment in our young people in that part of the state, and it builds upon some of the massive work that we have done to uplift training in a whole range of different areas, whether that is the care economy at our Alanvale hub, whether that is agriculture at the Freer Farm Training Facility or a range of different investments that are all about making a big difference to Tasmanians. We have seen what a difference it can make. 

Tasmania has the highest rate of completion of apprenticeships of any state in the country. That is a tribute to our hardworking apprentices who are busting their gut to get through their four years. It is a tribute to their families, who are supporting them every step of the way, and the businesses that take them on and have the confidence to help a young person get through that difficult journey of an apprenticeship [Bookmark: Phr10_O=251.6_D=17.8_C=0.82]  over the course of four years. It is also backed up by a government that believes in TasTAFE and in investing in the skills that Tasmanians need, rather than an opposition who, when they were last in government, blew up TAFE. It was an absolute basket case that hindered the growth in our economy.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=269.8_D=29.8_C=0.81] We have seen a range of different investments in areas to support participation. Our Jobs Hub Network is being closely looked at by other jurisdictions around the country and the Commonwealth as a nation-leading model. This is about how communities can work even more closely together to help identify the hidden gems within their communities so that we can better link people seeking work with those who have work available, and doing so in a manner that is more about a job outcome than a compliance outcome, which is what we [Bookmark: Phr12_O=299.7_D=5.3_C=0.76]  sadly see too much of at a federal level.

We have announced investments into the future of social enterprise. Hamlet Cafe will receive a further $750,000 over three years, and I want to thank the member for Franklin, Mr O'Byrne, for his advocacy there. Troublesmiths receives a $500,000 investment over four years, which has been secured as part of this Budget.

That is all about helping young people to get the confidence they need to take that next step - to do the transition from school to work and to be part of our beautiful community and build something big. It is also about breaking down the barriers that people might have, whether that is education, mental health or even something as simple as transport. That is why we are investing an additional $1.6 million into the Area Connect program, which is helping people address the transport issues that they might have getting to work and training and back home - people from the city who go out into the country areas and work as part of our agricultural sector, or from the country who come to the city seeking opportunities that might not be available closer to home. 

The Budget has also allocated $450,000 to begin the work to deliver a TasTAFE automotive training centre for the south following the unexpected flooding and closure of the Campbell Street workshop. The government builds on the significant investments that we have made to support Tasmanians into training and ensure we have the workforce needed to build our state, to build more homes and to deliver our essential services. 

I will just give a huge shout out to the team that have been working so diligently to deliver our game-changing student management system for TasTAFE. This will transform the way that learners are able to engage with TasTAFE and their teachers to make it a more modern, vibrant, data-driven and, ultimately, successful organisation, that really puts the learner at the centre of everything we do, engaging with learners in the ways that work for them.

The Budget delivers significant investments into first responders - an additional $2.5 million for the reinvigorated next round of the Volunteer Infrastructure Investment Fund. I can tell you from travelling to brigades and units right around the state the difference that this fund has made - $10 million as part of our previous budgets. It has transformed stations that have not had investment for decades; that were left to languish. They are now being upgraded.

We are making these facilities places that people want to be a part of, so that they can be a part of keeping their community safe. We are investing in better facilities for our growing female cohort of volunteers, and new community amenities so that more people can engage with their fire service or with the State Emergency Service (SES). There are major upgrades to support our first responders' safety with better PPC separation. These and many more are the kinds of investments that are helping to make a difference for our growing cohort of volunteers who want to be part of protecting their community - a lifestyle of service and sacrifice that they can do while they juggle all the other busy parts of life including family, work and other volunteering.

As I say, it is a $12.5 million investment all up through the Volunteer Infrastructure Investment Fund. It delivers important upgrades particularly to the SES, because we know that we need to get the SES up to speed with greater investment. For many years, the SES has languished under a funding model that is primarily driven by local government. Now that we are bringing those two organisations together to better serve the community, it is important that we invest as a state government into our SES, which is our primary storm and flood response and our primary response when it comes to road crash rescue in the regional areas of our state. We need to back those people in and that is exactly what this Budget does.

Planning also continues for new, fit-for-purpose emergency services hubs in communities from Kingston to Rosebery to Wynyard. We are building on the model that we have through the Sorell emergency services hub. I pay tribute to my colleague minister Vincent for his leadership role on that council. That is a visionary program that has transformed the opportunities for service and keeping the community safe in Sorell and the greater south east, and we want to extend that to other parts of our state.
In terms of Tasmania Police, the 2025-26 Budget makes clear we are backing in Tasmania Police to protect the community, with a massive $1.7 billion investment over the next four years. We are continuing to grow the most trusted police force in Australia, with 61 new officers added to the force in the last year alone. Since 2014 our government has taken our police numbers from 1120, which was off the back of 108 being sacked by the former Labor-Greens government, to 1421 today. That is a growth of 301 officers who are the ground protecting our communities and keeping them safe.

The Budget funds important initiatives to also give Tasmania Police the tools that they need to protect the community, such as the rollout of tasers for our first responders so that they have more force options available to them in difficult circumstances. Our police do incredible work and they are often call upon to protect the community in some of the most difficult circumstances imaginable. Providing that additional funding through the Budget is critical.

We have also seen last week the passage of Reid's Law, which is all about protecting Tasmanian communities from the scourge of knife crime. I want to pay tribute again to the incredible Laraine Ludwig and her work advocating for justice and change in the name of her son Reid, who was tragically killed in 2019. She has been such a force for good in our state and in parliament. The Budget includes support for her initiative and for Reid's Law by rolling out metal detection warrants for our frontline officers.

There is also investment in new ballistics vests and new body-worn cameras so that we can continue to ensure that our officers are safe and accountable and that evidence is better able to be gathered right across the spectrum of the work that they do. Our police will continue to benefit from the investment that we have in a range of different emergency services hubs. As first responders we are stronger together, and I know police are really committed to that work.

In housing, our government recognises that every Tasmanian deserves a roof over their head. That is why there is half a billion dollars' worth of additional investment in this Budget - so that we can continue the work of delivering our ambitious target of 10,000 social and affordable homes by 2032. We are on track. We have delivered 4300 and we are looking to continue to grow that. This Budget provides the pipeline of funding so that we have the pipeline of work ahead for our tradies. It is a critical investment.

We are also supporting a range of different community services: 674,000 over four years to expand the capacity of the amazing Hobart Women's Shelter and $2.82 million over the forward Estimates for the Bethlehem House facilities to provide services and beds for homeless men.

We are, of course, taking strong action by stamping out stamp duty for first home buyers valued up to $750,000, and expanding the successful 2 per cent deposit MyHome shared equity program. We need to take action across the housing spectrum if we are to avoid the fate of other states in this country where, frankly, the dream of home ownership that used to be the Australian dream has retreated far from those original goals. We cannot let Tasmania become like places like Sydney. The key to that is increasing housing supply across the spectrum. That is why we are so passionate about taking action in areas of homelessness services, but also in areas like investing in increased social housing, like the new investment that is coming online at Queens Walk. We are investing in affordable housing so that we can back Tasmanians who are doing it tough but want to be part of the rental market. For the aspiration of home ownership we are stamping out stamp duty and supporting people to get into a home with as little as a 2 per cent deposit.

We are also backing in our incredible workforce, particularly in health, but also in a range of different areas, so that we can continue to take pressure off the broader rental market and deliver comfortable facilities for those people who provide such wonderful services in all parts of our community.

We also build in this Budget a boost to our Social Housing Maintenance Fund of over $1.5 million over the next four years, which builds on last year's Social Housing Maintenance Fund commitment of up to $20 million over four years.

There is a range of different investments in planning, including the Development Assessment Panels funding, which will be key. I am really looking forward to bringing that legislation back to this parliament so that we can deliver more homes and give people a fair go who are looking to back in our community. 

We are really proud of the budget we have delivered because we are proud of Tasmanians. We want to give them the confidence for the future and we are delivering.

Time expired.

[3.58 p.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to give my comments on Appropriation Bill (No. 1), the Budget 2025-26. What is pretty clear to me is that this is a government that has basically given up. It has given up on governing. It has given up on trying to fix the budget problems that are all of this government's making.

What we also see is that the ministers are talking a lot about Labor. We saw the minister who is just leaving the room now, minister Ellis, in what was clearly an audition for maybe a vacancy in the Premier's office. He spent a good seven out of his 20 minutes just speaking about Labor, and he was turning around. Also, from the body language of his colleagues sitting behind him, it does not seem like he has much support, so if he is going to start hitting the phones, he may have to do a bit more work. Anyway, I digress. It is clear that the Liberals are a government that has given up. It is also clear that the Liberals do not understand how bad they are.

This is a budget that yet again rings huge alarm bells and yet the Premier and Treasurer pretend that everything is fine. All the Liberals appear, especially the backbenchers, either in despair or they have their heads in the sand. What they are actually doing in this Budget is getting a lot of the big calls wrong.

I will go through the Budget first and then I will probably speak a little bit more about housing at the end and maybe some other issues in my relevant portfolios. I would point out once again, like I did last year, that this government is the definition of 'poor management' because they are spending more to get worse outcomes. It is there for everyone to see. In the Budget there is discussion about the investment in health, education, public order and safety which accounts for 68 per cent of the total of the Budget. Expenditure across the 2025 Budget and forward Estimates, the investment in health has increased by 12 per cent to $14.5 billion. Education has increased by 5 per cent. Public order and safety has increased by 7 per cent. While that may seem like they are good figures, the problem that we have in Tasmania is that as a result, the services are getting worse.

We know that the health system is still under massive pressure. We know that wait-times are blowing out and so on and so forth. Education: the budget has increased and yet the performance of our students when compared to the same cohort of kids on the mainland, Tasmania's coming last. The government is not doing anything about that. It is throwing money at a problem, but nothing else, not actually trying to solve the problems because that requires thinking and it does not appear that this government is big on that.

Public order and safety has increased by 7 per cent across the forward Estimates, yet the backbencher Mr Behrakis is in Glenorchy reflecting, standing behind the minister in discussions about the crime rates in Glenorchy. The public order and safety has increased and yet it seems like crime rates are actually going up. That is, again, not fixing the problem.

The Liberals say many things and they do not follow up. What we hear is just empty words. The Budget is littered with things like 'responsible fiscal management is an integral component in the government's 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future.' This is just complete garbage. Reading sections from the 2025-26 Budget, it talks about how it continues the government's commitment to the fiscal strategy introduced in the 2023-24 Budget. I will get to that in a minute. It maintains the government's commitment to returning the net operating balance to surplus by 2029-30, as introduced in the 2024-25 Budget. This is just complete nonsense. You cannot have a treasurer of Tasmania talk about a commitment to returning the net operating balance to surplus when there is zero evidence of it.

We have heard in this place that the best way to predict future behaviour is to look at past behaviour. This is a government that says they are going to turn things around every year and what actually happens is the budget just gets worse and worse and worse. Again, the definition of poor management.

It talks about an addition of initiatives included in the 2025-26 Budget and forward Estimates - 'the government will continue to prioritise red tape reduction.' Have you heard that one before, Speaker? Have you heard that one before, members of this place? Yes, we have. For years, this government has been talking about red tape reduction. What have you been doing for 11 years? Red tape is still out of control and there was evidence from that which, hopefully, I will get to, that was just released today in the independent review of Homes Tasmania. The builders of Tasmania talk about the red tape that Homes Tasmania is creating. Here you go. You are creating your own red tape.

Here you are talking about prioritising red tape reduction, but what it seems like the priority is, is creating red tape. All the words are there: creating a more competitive, business friendly environment to stimulate economic growth and job creation while progressing landmark reforms across the government business sector. All that sort of stuff sounds pretty good, but there is absolutely no commitment to delivering it. They are just words.

The budget is in a crisis. This is a government that has given up on financial management and it seems like all they are trying to do from now on is hope for the best, that they are not going to actually bankrupt Tasmania and maybe, you know, lay a massive land mine for Labor to tread on at some other stage because they have completely given up.

How are they going to fix this mess? Obviously, this Budget is so bad that the government has to come up with some sort of fig leaf description on how they are going to fix this mess. How are they going to do it? They are going to establish an Efficiency and Productivity Unit - EPU, I think would be the term. Now you have an Efficiency and Productivity Unit, what is it going to do?

Another thing they are going to do is that the Tasmanian State Service will implement a hiring freeze to ensure that Tasmania has the right-sized public service. Again, that sounds a hell of a lot like consultant speak nonsense because what is the right-size public service? Why do you not just say you are going to sack a bunch of public servants and be honest, if you actually go through with it? It talks about continuing commitment to returning net operating balance to surplus by 2029-30, which - I have just pointed out - is complete nonsense.

How will this EPU deliver improved efficiency and productivity? It is going to do a comprehensive audit of all government programs. It is going to create whole-of-government frameworks. It is going to identify and support delivering of shared, common or jointly delivered services and capabilities, which will drive or enable efficiencies. It goes on to talk about process re-engineering, digitisation and automation, but the big question is: what have you been doing for 11 years?

Is this not just the normal business of government? No wonder the budget is completely out of control, because it appears you have been doing none of this and it has only just dawned on you that you have got to actually try and fix this budget mess of your own creation. How is this all going to be funded? In addition, the Department of Treasury and Finance has been allocated $3.3 million of new funding over two years to progress measures to achieve fiscal performance initiatives. That is really good; $3.3 million to turn around a debt that is spiralling out of control, out to $11 billion, and you reckon $3.3 million to the Department of Treasury and Finance is going to actually fix it? What nonsense.

You cannot just talk about efficiency dividends, you have to give it a new name, so you have called it a productivity and efficiency measure. It is just complete nonsense. As the EPU and the fiscal performance initiative advances, it will develop ongoing expenditure savings of $150 million per annum in the first instance. Wow. Considering that you are spending about a billion dollars more, so your expenditure is over a billion dollars more than income, savings of $150 million are going to turn things around. They are not. 

You talk about ensuring the state's resources are allocated to projects of highest impact and so on. Is that an admission that you have not been allocating your capital investment program well, because you now have to only allocate to projects of highest impact? The budget paper goes on and on. At least you did come up with a broad definition of a non-essential position - you have called it, 'A non-essential position is a position that could stop a role or function that could be reduced, redesigned or transitioned to digital service.' I really need an explanation of what that actually means. Does that mean if ChatGPT can do your job, then start looking for another one? It is just absolute nonsense. 

I could not believe this next section. I have read a lot of reports. I have had quite a varied career. I can spot consultant speak nonsense from a mile away. This is what it says in the actual budget - this is under the section of managing growth in public sector employment. It talks about:

The initiative will maintain a state service workforce that is the right size, is the right shape, is the right place, has the right enablers.

That is just complete nonsense. That is what you are relying on to bring your budget back under control, along with nonsense like 'modernising the expenditure decision-making.' Again, what have you been doing? What have you been doing as a government? There are massive alarm bells in the Budget, things like: 

On the downside, there is also a risk that Tasmania's population could stagnate or even decline. This would likely lead to reduced economic activity and could exacerbate current challenges around workforce shortages in an ageing population. 

We have been talking about this for years - about the number of young Tasmanians leaving this state for better opportunities [Bookmark: Phr3_O=32.6_D=2.6_C=0.57] . A plane load every four days is leaving. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=35.9_D=12.2_C=0.85]  We are getting back to the 1980s and 1990s. We have talked about the credit rating, spending is out of control, the economic vandalism of this Budget, but then there is this line [Bookmark: Phr5_O=49.2_D=9.8_C=0.90] :

… increased borrowing costs associated with supporting additional borrowings over the 2025-26 Budget and forward Estimate periods. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=59.4_D=29.8_C=0.79] 

That is interest on interest. You are borrowing money to pay interest. You have a look at the Budget, and there are a few tables that tell everything you need to know about the real state of Tasmania's finances. 

You look at the fiscal surplus/deficit, Table 1.1. Last year, this government promised to spend almost $1.3 billion more than income, so the state was going backwards $1.3 billion. What ended up happening is the state went back about $1.5 billion, and this continues across the forward Estimates. The fiscal deficit for this coming year is $1.3 billion, followed by $1.1 billion, followed by $590 million, followed by $380 million. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=117.0_D=1.7_C=0.91]  That is clearly unsustainable [Bookmark: Phr9_O=119.1_D=29.4_C=0.78] . The government may point to that and say, 'Oh, look, it is reducing', but they have been saying it is going to be reducing for the last three or four budgets. We have seen it going completely in the other direction, and that is why this government is in significant trouble with their debt. 

You look at Table 9.16, which is general government expenses from transactions by purpose. This highlights how this government produces budgets that are not based on reality. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=148.8_D=29.0_C=0.83]  The Health budget for last year was $3.14 billion, but the estimated outcome was actually $3.52 billion, so they spent $400 million more than they budgeted for. What is going to happen this year? Every year the government has been spending more on Health than their budget stated. They have had to come back; they have had to ask for more money. Yet across the forward Estimates, the spending either reduces or is flat. It is the same in Education; it either reduces or is flat. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=178.5_D=5.4_C=0.81]  This is not the reality, and that is why there is a significant risk to our state's credit rating.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=184.3_D=11.6_C=0.81] The other thing you should look at is the summary of strategic action and targets, table 3.14, which basically goes through the fiscal strategy [Bookmark: Phr13_O=197.6_D=16.6_C=0.73] . They are not meeting any of these. The aim or target is to keep the state's credit rating the same as what it is. At the moment they are failing that because Moody's is A2 negative, whereas the target is A2 stable. Standard and Poor's is A+ negative, whereas the target is actually AA+ stable. They are failing that, and what we are looking at is more than likely another credit downgrade. 

Gross debt per capita, fiscal strategy - failing that; net debt to state gross product - failing that; gross debt including the defined benefit superannuation to cash receipts - failing that; fiscal balance - failing that; total general government sector own-source revenue as a percentage of total expenditure - failing that; [Bookmark: Phr15_O=245.0_D=17.2_C=0.88]  impact of government business enterprise, state-owned companies and general government sector - failing that; and so on. Out of the 11 actions, they are comprehensively failing seven of them. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=264.5_D=3.6_C=0.72]  Their Budget is completely unsustainable. There it is. There is your evidence.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=269.3_D=18.2_C=0.90] In table 8.5 - General Government Net Interest Cost Ratio - the estimated outcome is $230 million on interest ballooning out in 2028-29 to $650 million, but that is if this Budget can be believed.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=288.6_D=16.4_C=0.76] What do they do? The Budget is clearly unsustainable. Everybody is saying that the Budget is clearly unsustainable, but we just get the same nonsense from this government, pretending that everything is fine. The Treasurer will say there is a clear pathway to surplus. It is absolute garbage, but they do this across all the portfolios. You only have to look at housing, for example. They are crowing about their performance in housing - 10,000 houses, and we are already 4000 houses there apparently. It is just complete nonsense. 

There is an article by Josh Duggan at the ABC talking about a Tasmanian program designed to encourage the sale of affordable land. It is yet to deliver any land after 10 months. In the 10 months after applications opened for the Residential Land Rebate program, seven successful applicants have been allocated $682,000, but as of 20 May, zero lots have been sold. They are crowing about their performance. The minister talks about social and affordable housing as part of this 10,000 homes target. Social housing, they have built 1414 - as of - we got an RTI a little while ago. How many affordable housing new builds? How many, I ask rhetorically - this government probably has no idea. Two.

Two, and yet they talk about social and affordable housing. What is their total count for affordable housing? Two out of that 4000. How does this work? It is because the government is just spouting garbage, day after day after day. The independent review into Homes Tasmania came out today, and I think that says everything about this government and the way they do things. It is quite a well-structured document of 27 pages. It says:

Homes Tasmania was intended to play a leading role in implementation of the overall housing supply. The new structure was to allow more innovation, more efficiency and faster development to get homes off the ground. Since then, the demand for social and affordable housing and homelessness services has not abated and the numbers on the housing register increased, along with the time it takes priority applicants to be housed.

What does that mean? Things have gotten worse. I am quoting; all these are quotes. It further says:

The promise of innovative, flexible partnerships to speed up the supply of housing has not been delivered.

I am just skipping through because I am actually running out of time. The summary of recommendations says:

General conclusion

The promise of flexibility, innovation and speed to deliver has not been met by the establishment of Homes Tasmania as a statutory authority …

…

The internal government structures and processes within control of organisation and board are not working optimally to set Homes Tasmania up for success. 

…

They were disappointed that Homes Tasmania failed to secure funding as part of the first round of the Commonwealth Housing Australia Future Fund (HAFF).

…

The current volume of applications under My Home's Shared Equity Housing program is said to be beyond the capacity of these offices to service without lengthy delays.

So on and so on and so on:

Stakeholders consistently complained that there was no clarity on -

the types of housing that will make up the 10,000 target

…

High-profile projects like the purchase of Fountainside Hotel to house health workers has generated debate on whether Homes Tasmania should focus on key worker housing… and the extent to which Homes Tasmania participates in the MyHome Shared Equity program has been seen by some as detracting from the urgent need for crisis and social housing.

… inherent tension between the role of the board and minister in government authorities…

… tension is obvious…

I highlighted some things, but I will have to skip forward:

The inclusion of vacant land…

which is part of this whole nonsense to get up to the 4000 homes built -
… contributing to the government's 10,000 homes received most criticism and has led to the scepticism of the efficacy of reporting more generally.

and so on. I might just get to mention one of the issues from the builders. This sector was most critical of the red tape involved in working with Homes Tasmania, et cetera. What is the government's response? Here it is, look at this. Lots of pictures. A page of pictures. There is a page with a picture of the minister on it, another half-page picture, then another half-page picture, 'What has the review told us?', and so on and so forth. Basically the response is to delay a response.

[4.17 p.m.]
Mr JAENSCH (Braddon - Minister for Finance) - Honourable Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to speak on the 2025-26 Tasmanian State Budget. I commend the Treasurer for delivering a responsible and forward-looking budget that tackles significant fiscal challenges head on. This is a budget that clearly reflects this government's commitment to investing in our communities and advancing the goals of our 2030 Strong Plan. This Budget also reflects necessary difficult decisions, while continuing to prioritise essential services and ensuring that no Tasmanian is left behind. I look forward to delivering important components of that plan through my portfolios.

Protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of Tasmania's vulnerable children and young people is a clear priority for the Tasmanian Government. The 2025-26 Budget upholds the government's ongoing commitment to reforms in child safety, out-of-home care and youth justice, and to implementing the recommendations arising from the commission of inquiry with significant investment over the next four years.

The 2025-26 State Budget provides additional funding of $15 million over two years commencing in 2025-26 to meet demand in out-of-home care services to Tasmanian children and young people. This funding builds on the support provided in relation to commission of inquiry recommendation 9.1 - $30 million per year in the 2024-25 Budget to increase the baseline funding for out-of-home care across the forward Estimates. The total out-of-home care budget is over $90 million per annum.

The government is continuing to deliver its commitment to ensure that every child and young person is known, safe, well and learning by providing further investment of $40 million across 2025-26 and the forward Estimates. This comprises of 'Bringing Baby Home', $10.3 million over four years, which will continue to provide critical support for families with an infant experiencing complex needs, to ensure they can remain safely together at home. The Intensive Family Engagement Service, $8 million over two years, has been allocated to support families that have been assessed by the Child Safety Service as experiencing complex issues that directly impact on the safety and wellbeing of children and young people and who are at risk of entering the statutory system. 'Transition to Independence', $6.2 million over two years, will support up to 120 young people and will also continue to deliver financial allowances to family-based carers and the Learning Incentive Allowance. Enhanced case management for children and young people in detention and out of home care - $7 million over three years provided to ensure greater monitoring, transparency and responsiveness around care for young people in detention and in the child safety system.

Looking to youth justice, this government continues to drive the comprehensive reform of the entire youth justice system through implementation of the commission of inquiry recommendations. The Youth Justice Blueprint 2024-34 remains a key priority. The investment in youth justice initiatives over the next three years from 2025-26 is $31.8 million. This funding includes an investment of over $10 million over 3 years for early intervention and diversion, including assisted bail and supported accommodation.

We will continue to invest in further early intervention and diversion options to build on those which have already commenced. This includes the delivery of additional places in JCP Youth's Beast Program throughout the 2030 Strong Plan, an investment of $3.7 million over three years; our engagement with the Brighton community and the delivery of a place-based diversion trial there; and the commencement of a Youth After-hours Diversion Service pilot in Hobart's northern suburbs. The government's ongoing focus on early intervention and diversion from offending, re-offending and detention will see the delivery of more services that address underlying offending behaviours and support offenders reintegrating into the community.

The Youth After-hours Diversion Service is part of the first stage of a larger diversion program, with the intent to now focus on the second stage, consisting of integrated case management and specialised accommodation services. We will be adding additional sites as part of our local place-based initiatives commitment, and have commenced discussions with the Glenorchy City Council about initiatives in their community, which I know our members for Clark will welcome -

Ms Ogilvie - Yes, we are both here cheering you on.

Mr JAENSCH - and I look forward to their involvement and advice as we progress those plans.

We will also complete the review of the 54 Reasons Bail Support and Transition from Detention program, including identifying opportunities to expand assisted bail and transition from detention services.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=7.1_D=23.0_C=0.89] The delivery of the new Tasmanian youth justice facility also remains a key focus, with the facility master plan now complete and publicly released. The Budget shows additional funding over two years, commencing in 2026-27, to increase the total allocation for youth justice facilities to approximately $150 million. 

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.5_D=13.8_C=0.89] Our 2025-26 Budget continues our commitment to supporting stronger communities and includes a focus on the needs of Tasmanians here and now, as well as supporting longer term improvements. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=52.1_D=29.4_C=0.85]  In 2025-26 and across the forward Estimates, we are increasing available funding for the Energy Hardship Fund by providing an additional $150,000 per year for four years to provide support to more Tasmanians in need. This is in addition to the $350,000 already committed on an annual basis for the Energy Hardship Fund [Bookmark: Phr5_O=81.7_D=30.0_C=0.87] , which is administered by the Salvation Army and directly helps Tasmanians in need to pay their energy bills. 

To further address the cost of living, we are committing $7.1 million over four years to support the implementation of a new food resilience strategy, to be released in coming weeks; continuation of programs and services that support the delivery of food relief to Tasmanians; delivery of initiatives that focus on building food resilience in local communities; and development and delivery [Bookmark: Phr6_O=111.8_D=6.6_C=0.84]  of community-led solutions to address long-term food insecurity and build food resilience in their communities. 

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=120.2_D=28.4_C=0.85] Our government knows that Neighbourhood Houses are key pillars of healthy, supportive and inclusive communities. Since 2021, our government has provided the Neighbourhood House network with funding support of over $40 million. In 2025-26, we are once again demonstrating our ongoing commitment to Neighbourhood Houses, providing additional funding for the Community Connector Program of $324,000 per year for four years. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=149.3_D=25.7_C=0.90]  This funding is in addition to the $6.93 million committed in 2024-25 for the continuation and expansion of the program over four years. In 2025-26, over $15 million will be provided to the Neighbourhood House network across core funding, booster funding, peak body funding, capital improvement and Community Connector Program funding.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=176.6_D=26.8_C=0.86] Released in January 2025, A Respectful, Age-Friendly Island: Older Tasmanians Action Plan 2025-2029, details our government's vision for a respectful, age-friendly island where older Tasmanians are valued, connected and supported. To support the plan, we have committed over $3 million across 2024-25 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=204.2_D=4.7_C=0.83]  and 2025-26 to deliver key priorities that support older Tasmanians. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=210.5_D=20.6_C=0.91]  Through the 2025-26 State Budget, we are demonstrating our ongoing support by further providing $10,000 per year for four years to oversee the implementation of the action plan, including the establishment of a governance group, and $271,000 per year for three years to implement actions in the action plan. 

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=233.8_D=29.4_C=0.85] Our government is continuing our commitment to progressing equality in Tasmania. Working closely with Working It Out and Equality Tasmania, our government will soon be releasing Tasmania's LGBTIQA+ strategy for 2025 to 2030. Through the 2025-26 State Budget, we are responding to the Tasmanian LGBTIQA+ community by providing $ [Bookmark: Phr13_O=263.3_D=11.4_C=0.82] 192,000 for the delivery of the strategy and subsequent action plan, and $10,000 to oversee the strategy and action plan through the LGBTIQA+ reference group.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=276.1_D=28.9_C=0.90] Through the 2025-26 Budget, our government is demonstrating ongoing support and recognition of the important contribution of over 87,000 unpaid Tasmanian carers by providing $110,000 in 2025-26 to develop a new carer action plan, following the conclusion of the current plan in December, and $10,000 for four years to oversee the implementation of the action plan through the minister's carers advisory council. The new action plan, to be released in 2026, will reflect what we have learnt and heard from Tasmanian carers about what is important for them. 

Volunteering is vital for the Tasmanian community and our economy. The 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future commits to developing Tasmania's first volunteering strategy and action plan. Our government is working closely with Volunteering Tasmania to make this a reality, and I look forward to releasing the new strategy in coming weeks. To support this important delivery, through the 2025-26 Budget, we are increasing our support for our Tasmanian volunteers who are critical to communities across the state. Our investment includes $100,000 for the delivery of actions in year 1 of the action plan and $300,000 per year for two years to deliver a pilot to make Registrations to Work with Vulnerable People free for volunteers. The rollout of this exciting initiative will commence in August this year.

Delivering on our 2024-25 commitment, in March this year, our government released Embracing Diversity, Fostering Belonging: Tasmania's Multicultural Action Plan 2025-2029, reflecting our ongoing commitment to support culturally and linguistically diverse Tasmanians. Through the 2025-26 State Budget, we are providing $190,000 to implement the plan; $10,000 to establish an advisory group to oversee the implementation of the plan; uplifted funding from multicultural festivals to $15,000 per year for four years, with this funding being provided to Festa Italia, Estia Greek Festival and the Chinese Lunar New Year Festival; and an uplift in funding to $30,000 for two years for the Diwali Festival as a new and emerging cultural event, and $15,000 for the following two years -

Ms Ogilvie - It went really well.

Mr JAENSCH - I am sure it did. It looked fantastic.

Ms Ogilvie - It did. Thank you.

Mr JAENSCH - There is also funding of $15,000 per year for four years for the Nepalese community to establish a cultural event.

Our government is committed to providing longer-term funding arrangements for community sector organisations to provide funding certainty, enabling organisations to operate with increased confidence and engage in longer term sustainable planning and business practices. A-whole-of-government model to implement longer-term funding arrangements is being progressed across Tasmanian government agencies. The model uses a staged approach. Stage 1 focuses on recurrent funding for community services' peak bodies. By 30 June, we expect to have agreed with each organisation regarding how their peak body funding will transition to a longer-term agreement. Stage 2 will address other recurrent funding within the community services sector. This will also require focus on addressing mechanisms across government, such as the role of procurement versus traditional grant agreements and the differences between agency funding mechanisms. 

Within the Mental Health and Wellbeing portfolio, which encompasses all acute and community mental health and alcohol and other drugs services, as well as public health services and community pharmacy, we are continuing to work to increase access for all Tasmanians, with a focus on earlier intervention and provision of services in the community. 

The 2025-26 State Budget demonstrates our continued dedication to meeting this need, with almost $44 million in increased spending to meet demand for Statewide Mental Health Services over the next four years. The additional demand funding will allow for continuing mental health services, including the mental health emergency response service in three major population areas, ongoing implementation of the Tasmanian Suicide Prevention Strategy and funding to continue to support a 10-year reform agenda for the alcohol and other drugs sector in Tasmania.

We have also increased staffing in Statewide Mental Health Services by 273 FTE since 2019-20. This represents a 25 per cent increase in funded FTEs. 

Through the Community Sector Grants program, the government, through the Department of Health, administers approximately 170 funding agreements within the Mental Health and Wellbeing portfolio. These agreements provide services and supports in areas such as treatment, counselling, education and support for people impacted by alcohol and other drug use, support for people with cancer, mental health and suicide prevention, infectious disease prevention and broader preventive health initiatives. Total funding provided for community sector organisations (CSOs) under the agreement in the Mental Health and Wellbeing portfolio exceeds $53 million this financial year. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=17.9_D=24.0_C=0.89]  The mental health and well-being portfolio also overseas community pharmacies and I was pleased and proud to make a pre-budget announcement of $5 million over two years to extend pharmacy scope of practice, to subsidise training for pharmacists to provide treatments for a wider range of common conditions as well as nation leading pilot to allow pharmacists to [Bookmark: Phr3_O=42.8_D=9.5_C=0.69]  co-prescribe medications with GPS in aged care facilities, ultimately helping to ease the burden on our GPS and hospital emergency departments.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=57.2_D=27.2_C=0.85] The government, through the Department of Health, has also committed further funding for mental health services and supports in 2025-26, including $340,000 for the Home Based Housing and Accommodation Support Initiative and $117,000 for the Movember Foundation Men's Health Program targeted at supporting mental health and well-being of men, which in turn can support improved well-being of families. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=85.2_D=12.3_C=0.71]  We are also providing the peak body, the Mental Health Council of Tasmania, $800,000 for the Lived Experience Training Hub over the forward Estimates and $125,000 for the Take a Minute campaign.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=98.5_D=29.4_C=0.85] Our government is also transforming our mental health system through a commitment of approximately $280 million over the Budget and forward Estimates for capital investment in mental health infrastructure, including our commitment to St. John's Park Health and Well-being Precinct in the south, new mental health precincts and mental health hubs in the north and the north-west. These new builds will provide essential acute mental health services and support contemporary best-practice models of care and reflect [Bookmark: Phr7_O=128.1_D=2.7_C=0.84]  modern standards in mental health facility design.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=134.7_D=29.3_C=0.86] Within public health services, our government is working towards our key to deliverables under our Healthy Tasmania Five-Year Strategic Plan 2022 to 2026, the Tobacco Action Plan 2022 to 2026 and multiple other health programs such as our Winter Wellness campaign. We are also developing Tasmania's first 20-Year Preventative Health Strategy, a bold long term plan to place prevention at the heart of our health [Bookmark: Phr9_O=164.5_D=28.4_C=0.84]  and communities. The new strategy will extend beyond the health sector and will be owned by all agencies. Public Health began extensive consultation in October 2024, which closed at the end of last month, conducting many, many interviews, regional forums and receiving submissions. I look forward to the finalisation of the strategy in collaboration with my ministerial colleagues at their departments and our industry and community sector partners later this year.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=199.7_D=16.8_C=0.89] I am proud of the work that our government is doing. I am proud of the work that our Treasurer and our party in government have done to address the challenges that we face in repairing the state's finances after the essential but unplanned [Bookmark: Phr12_O=218.4_D=6.4_C=0.91]  extraordinary expenses involved in responding to the challenge of COVID-19 pandemic [Bookmark: Phr13_O=225.6_D=24.7_C=0.89] , keeping people safe in work, keeping businesses alive through that period and in stimulating our economy and the rebound after that disruption which has left Tasmania in a strong position now. You have heard the Premier and the Treasurer and others speak about the strength of our economy, our low unemployment, our high business confidence, all of which are essential if we are going to maintain [Bookmark: Phr14_O=251.2_D=5.1_C=0.92]  the revenues needed in the future to continue to support many of the [Bookmark: Phr15_O=257.2_D=29.8_C=0.88]  community sector organisations and the services that they deliver and the essential services that we as government deliver for some of our most vulnerable Tasmanians, especially children and young people who I deal with in my portfolio every day. 

From my presentation today you can see that we are continuing to strongly invest in all of these areas at record levels to provide services for those in need while we continue to build on the strength of our economy and ensure Tasmania is [Bookmark: Phr16_O=287.2_D=3.1_C=0.72]  invested in to become a better place now and into the future.

[4.38p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I will make some brief comments about the Budget overall and then make some comments specific to my portfolios. When the Liberal government came to power some 11 years ago, they had a significant amount of money in the bank, left by the Labor administration, the outgoing government. There was over $208 million, in fact, in investments and cash, which is effectively money in the bank. What we have seen over those intervening 11 years is that we now have the worst debt in the state's history.

Interest payments alone on the debt that the Liberal government has plunged us into are astronomical, to the point where we will be paying more in interest payments than we spend on ambulance services and emergency departments put together. That is an appalling fact and that is something that this Liberal government has done to Tasmania's budget. The debt that they have put us into means the equivalent of nearly $50,000 debt per household in Tasmania.

I know that sometimes people think people do not worry about debt and deficit of governments, that they consider the debt and deficit of government different to the debt and deficit of a household, but think about that, Deputy Speaker - the equivalent of $50,000 of debt per household in Tasmania. That is going to take a generation to fix. It is going to take decades to fix the mess that this government has put us into.

The fact that the government has racked up debt and deficit does actually have a tangible impact on us as individuals, on individual taxpayers, workers, households, and families in the Tasmanian community. A massive government debt and deficit means government cuts to spending, and government cuts to jobs. We can see in this Budget 2500 public sector jobs will go. We know that the public sector has already been subjected to recruitment freezes and vacancy control measures, where the government pays lip service to those public servants, tells them that they will not be cutting frontline jobs, and then cuts jobs like nurses and cleaners.

They are frontline jobs by anyone's definition. Hospital cleaners and nurses who have had their jobs cut. They are frontline jobs and yet, the government keeps telling us no frontline job will be affected. Never mind the fact that they are looking at cutting what they might define as backline jobs: administrative jobs, pharmacy jobs, pathology jobs, because they are not patient-facing, but you cannot run a hospital without pharmacists. You cannot run a hospital without the people who book people in for their appointments and for their surgeries and that is what we are seeing under this government. That is what we are going to see under their public servant cuts. They call it vacancy control, they call it recruitment freeze, but it means one thing. It means job cuts and that is what we are going to see under this government: more and more of that to come. 

You hear people in the national media say that the Liberals are good budget managers, that the economy is safe under the Liberal party, that they are good financial managers. Where do they get off telling people that? Where do they get off telling people that they are good financial managers, when what we can see, over 11 years of Liberal administration in Tasmania, is that we have gone from a government that had money in the bank to going into the worst net debt in Tasmania's history? It is shameful and it is something that is going to cost every single Tasmanian taxpayer for at least a generation to come.
The other way that massive debt and deficit in a government perspective affects individuals is the selling off of public assets, which is what Jeremy Rockliff has made the legacy of his premiership. The plan to sell off Tasmania's public assets that we have built over 100 years of hard work, of Tasmanians working in our government business enterprises, things like the Metro, our transport system, TasNetworks, our power system, and MAIB.

He said the Hydro was off the table, but Momentum is not - that is a part of the Hydro. We know that he will stop at nothing to sell off those Tasmanian assets, those government business enterprises that not only provide jobs, not only provide public infrastructure but they also provide revenue back to government to spend on things like public sector jobs, public services, funding community sector services, which we heard Mr Jaensch speak about just now. Those things cannot be funded without government revenue. 

Selling off the government business enterprises to the highest bidder is going to mean higher bus prices, higher insurance costs, higher car registration costs and higher power prices. Selling off government assets means jobs go, prices go up and we lose that revenue to spend on government services like hospitals and schools. That is what it means when the Liberals are selling off our government business enterprises. They are going to lost $620 million in revenue for a short sugar hit of selling off those businesses in one financial year. The Budget might look good for a heartbeat or two, and then, bam, we have lost those jobs; we have lost that public infrastructure. Once those GBEs become privately owned, decisions will be made in the interests of shareholders and owners, not in the interests of Tasmanian people. 

The Labor Party stands for people before profits, people before government decisions that are going to decimate our public services. It is not win-win; it is lose-lose. It will mean higher bus fares. It could mean fewer routes. It will mean higher power prices, higher insurance costs, higher car registration and, of course, losing that revenue to fund things like hospitals, ambulance services, police service, tourism, or child safety. Every public service and every community organisation providing services on behalf of government is under threat because of this plan to sell off government businesses. 

Regarding community sector funded services, we heard the Community Services minister, Mr Jaensch, go to that a little in question time today, as well as in his Budget reply speech. I heard what Mr Jaensch had to say at the TasCOSS budget event and I can understand why the community services sector is feeling very fragile and at risk right now under the leadership of this government and this minister. They have been promising some of the things he said for the whole time they have been in government. For 11 years, the government has been saying that things like outcomes-based purchasing, longer-term funding agreements and procurement processes will be modernised. Those hardworking Tasmanians in the community services sector have been taking the government on its word, warmly welcoming those commitments year after year, minister after minister, and yet nothing has been delivered. 

I did listen to Mr Jaensch and I feel like he does get it. He gets that there are problems with procurement. He gets that there is pressure on the sector - more so than his predecessors. However, unfortunately, what he said to that room has not given them the comfort they need that their funding is secure. It has, in fact, done the opposite. Here is what he said. When he was talking about modernising funding agreements, moving from grant-based procurement to contracts, he said:

If you have a funding agreement that is coming to an end, you need to be planning for that to end and not relying on it. If you have funding that extends past that period, you know you've got certainty for that. We want to differentiate between short-term funding agreements and those that will be renewed and renewed and renewed. 

Well, I can tell you that the funding agreements that have been 'renewed and renewed and renewed' are for core services. No one is disagreeing with the idea of modernising the contracting service. In fact, many have been calling for that for a long time. However, what the minister told them is if your core services contract is set to expire, plan for it to expire. Those are core funding agreements that are funding things like staff in the mental health sector, staff in the child safety system, staff who are providing alcohol and drug counselling and rehabilitation, staff who are providing financial counselling, and staff who are providing housing services. All of those have been provided through, in the minister's words, 'short-term funding agreements that will be renewed and renewed and renewed'. 

The threat that people heard in his words there was: 'That is how you have always been funded and if you are coming up for a renewal date, it is not a renewal date; it is a cancellation. Get ready.' What that means is community organisations cannot recruit and retain staff. You cannot recruit and retain a professional workforce, which we know the community sector is, when you have this threat of funding being cut hanging over your head year in, year out. These are professional people who are dedicating their careers to working in community services. Community sector organisations that I speak to across the whole spectrum of community services tell me how difficult it is to get people to come and work because they do not know if they have continuity of funding for continuity of contracts. What it also means is boards and CEOs are wasting their time planning for redundancy contingencies that, hopefully, they will not need to put into place because their funding will be renewed. When those words left the minister's mouth at the TasCOSS budget event, I can understand why the sector is feeling very worried.

The other thing he said, in answer to a question, was:

We have to agree on what we are aiming to achieve and then agree on the costs involved in achieving that. Don't enter it if you don't agree at both ends of that. 

He means the organisation and the government.

We have to make sure that we are informed and that we have a way of working out what the fair costs of things is, working out what's the outcomes we are seeking and what we can [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.4_D=28.6_C=0.83]  reasonably expect the cost of that to be, and then also ensuring that we are leaving potential there for you to find a smarter, better, cheaper way wherever that's possible. 
They are the words that people took offence to that felt very patronising because community organisations are already adept at achieving a lot with very little. Since COVID, demand on all their services has dramatically increased and their funding has not, so they are already achieving more with less [Bookmark: Phr4_O=90.0_D=2.3_C=0.82]  - less funding because it has not increased [Bookmark: Phr5_O=92.8_D=28.5_C=0.85]  adequate to the increase in demand on their services. They are already achieving more with less; they are already doing as much as they possibly can. However, the minister has said they need to find a 'smarter, better, cheaper' way to do that. We have heard that before from this government in respect of their planning policy commitments back in 2014, or perhaps earlier, that they had designed a better, faster, cheaper planning system for Tasmania and we are still waiting to see that. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=122.1_D=28.7_C=0.88]  

I hope that the end result of this is that they continue to fund the community services sector, but I can tell you that those words are why people are feeling threatened. You do have to wonder because we have seen very vindictive decisions by ministers in the past that have been based on personal views and value sets that have led to the defunding of organisations that have been providing vital services. I would hate to see us return to a time where that kind of thing happens again.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=152.3_D=25.2_C=0.80] I will also go to something that was raised yesterday. That is the funding cut to the Cancer Council and Quit Tasmania. Two of their funding lines have had significant cuts. First of all, their anti-tobacco campaigns has been cut by 50 per cent. Quit Tasmania, which is auspiced by the Cancer Council, has [Bookmark: Phr8_O=178.3_D=2.0_C=0.82]  strong investment in anti-tobacco campaigns. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=180.8_D=10.2_C=0.81]  They are focused on things like preventing uptake amongst young people, promoting people to quit, encouraging people to quit, and preventing relapse. They are the ads that you see on TV, things like 'Don't Give Up Giving Up'. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=192.7_D=17.8_C=0.86]  They have been investing in those. They are at best-practice levels. That funding has been cut by half. 

They were told about that in February. They have been lobbying hard and were very much hoping when they saw the Budget handed down last week that they would see that money reinstated. Unfortunately, that is not the case. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=211.3_D=23.5_C=0.83]  What that means is that they are going to have at least a 40 per cent reduction in their television advertising, 80 to 90 per cent reduction in social and digital and out-of-home ads. That is posters and the like. They will have to cut back on campaign licensing tracking surveys that are used to evaluate the government's Tasmanian Tobacco Action Plan.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=235.7_D=30.0_C=0.84] That is not advertising for the fun of it; it is not like advertising a product or a service. This is public health spending that really works. Those 'Don't Give Up Giving Up' ads, those ads that you see on TV, in buses, in the community, on social media that are encouraging people to give up smoking really work and they reduce smoking rates. 

We still have the highest smoking rate in the country, bar the Northern Territory, I believe. We also have some of the highest rates of chronic [Bookmark: Phr13_O=265.8_D=7.9_C=0.87]  disease in the country. This is a proven way to reduce smoking and increase public health and wellnes [Bookmark: Phr14_O=274.1_D=29.6_C=0.83] s, and the government has just cut it by 50 per cent. What is going to be the result of that? Only one: an increase in smoking rates. What is that going to mean? An increase in service demand on alcohol and drug counselling services, on hospital admissions for tobacco-related illness, for time trying to get in to see your GP or another health professional about trying to give up, smoking cessation programs and the like. When they cut something like this, it is so counterintuitive because what it is going to do is cost them a heck of a lot more money down the track when people take up smoking, increase smoking, when they are not exposed to some of that really supportive public health messaging that we know works and it works nationwide.

The second source of funding that has been limited as well is the specific funding for youth-focused anti-vaping campaigns. This is something that we just talked about in the parliament this year, when we updated that legislation, might have been, late last year, when minister Barnett was health minister. That was time-limited funding, but as an organisation, they put in their budget submission focusing on a multi-year investment in youth-focused campaigns.

That was going to build on what was already a really successful campaign with enormous momentum that had been launched just six months earlier. It was an award-winning campaign, it had great success, and it supported those new laws that we have put in place around the availability of vapes in Tasmania. It also addressed other emerging tobacco products like nicotine pouches and the like; other ways of ingesting tobacco and nicotine.

They did think that funding was going to continue. It is really recent funding. It was given to that organisation, in large part, to comply with those vaping laws that we passed through this place. What is the point in making legislative change if you do not then fund the community organisation that is going to put that change into effect and actually bring to life the intention of the parliament with that legislation, which is what Quit Tasmania and Cancer Council was funded to do with that anti-vaping campaign for young people.

We already know there is enormous availability of illicit tobacco and illegal vapes in this state. That is something that the government has committed to addressing, but they are not doing the right things to address it. They are cutting the spending on public health campaigns that would actually reduce smoking rates. That is just one example of a community organisation that has lost a large chunk of funding because of this government's mismanagement. This Liberal party's mismanagement of the budget for 11 years, to the point where we are in a state where commentators, economists who know far more than I do about budget management, are saying this is the worst that the state has ever seen and it is going to take a generation to fix it.

Tasmania needs change. The Labor party has plans to embark on budget repair, that seems to be the way it goes in politics. The Liberal party, who somehow have this misapplied reputation as being good budget managers, wreck the joint and then leave Labor to mop it up. We will be holding this government to account on the commitments that they have made in the Budget. We will be holding them to account on things like the sweeping job cuts that are likely to affect the public sector as well as the community services sector. 

Ultimately, the community services sector is providing services on behalf of government. It is not the same as a private business providing services because they wish to or their owners or shareholders wish them to. Community organisations are funded with taxpayers' money to provide services that would otherwise be provided by the government and they used to be provided by the government. We now have an agile community services sector that provides those services on behalf of government.

If they cannot fund them properly, they need to get ready to become the provider again, because they used to be the provider and that is what is going to happen if you end up with a community services sector that is so underfunded and stretched that they cannot do the job that government has paid them to do.

I do hope that Tasmanians will take the mismanagement of this government very seriously and the commitments that the Labor Party has made to embark on budget repair and to put Tasmania back in to a positive financial future.

[4.57 p.m.]
Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for Innovation, Science, and the Digital Economy) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I have been listening very carefully to all of the contributions and I just have to note how sad it is that the other side has not been able to find anything positive to say about our beautiful state over many, many hours of discussion in the house this morning. I have prepared some notes, but I do think I just want to make a personal contribution. I get up every morning and I think how fortunate I am to be in this role, and how lucky I am to live in this beautiful state. I am from a very old Tassie family and we have seen the highs and lows, five or six generations here, ups and downs, convict stock, wars, depressions, all sorts of things - but the overblown hyperbole and catastrophizing that I have heard this morning really takes the cake. In any organisation, in any government, there is work to be done. We are doing that work and we are doing it prudently and sensibly.

I am really quite surprised, also, at some of the personal commentary that some have sought to make. I would suggest that if you cannot win the argument based on facts and the argument, resorting to talking about individuals is not the way to go. Sadly in this place we have seen a growing tendency to do that, not just in this Chamber but across other forums as well.

I am really pleased to be here, really pleased to be serving Tasmanians, really pleased to be providing my comments in relation to the state budget, and to roam a little bit across the things that matter for all Tasmanians. I do that as a working mum and I do that as a woman now into, I think, the 30th year of a career, and a decade or so in this place.

This Budget drives back businesses, it creates jobs, it supports families and it builds stronger and safer communities. They are things that we can all agree upon. We want to invest in Tasmania - that is what is happening here - and in the things that matter to Tasmanians. We all know what they are. That is what this Budget delivers and it puts a foundation under those things - cost of living, health, education, public safety, and roofs over heads are very important. It does all of that. Importantly, it is building back a better Tasmania, not just for now, but for the future, for our future. That is because on this side of the Chamber what we are doing is looking forward with optimism, hard work, strength, and with a strategic eye to where we are taking our economy.

There have been responses to the Budget which were very upbeat. I know from the business community it has been spoken of this morning. Michael Bailey's comments about business confidence being strong in Tasmania are very true, and that businesses look forward to the coming years of a very robust Tasmanian economy. To listen to the commentary from the other side this morning, you would think that had never been said. It is a very strange set of circular arguments that we heard, particularly, I think, from the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow treasurer.

We know that in business, Tasmania is a key driver of employment, small business in particular, which of course we support wholeheartedly. We know that unemployment has never been so low in Tasmania. I was around in the 80s. We had the dams case, we had all that stuff going on in the 80s, but there were not any jobs. It was a really difficult time. I, like many other people, had to leave the state to get a job. We came back, and I am very pleased to be here now.

In some degrees there is a thing that people like to do which is called travel, and they return with more skills. I was fortunate to return with my family and to build my family and career here after having been away for some time. We want to see that. We want people to make that choice to live in Tasmania, to live here, to work and to raise a family and have that opportunity.

We appreciate, because we are all in it together, that family budgets can be thin. They are particularly thin at the moment. We know that higher inflation and higher interest rates continue to challenge families and businesses as they participate in daily life. Every little bit we can do helps, from continued half price bus fares for school students and regional routes, to a $60 credit on power bills, some $6.7 million in food relief programs for those who really need it the most, and expanding the Healthy School Lunch Program, just to name a few. We are talking of what Tasmanians need and want.

I am regularly out and about in my electorate, as I am sure everybody in this Chamber is, and we have heard discussion of the northern suburbs of my electorate this morning as well. Great people, great place. I am always really, really pleased to get out there. I love Claremont in particular: go The Mont football. We are doing some good things in Glenorchy, such as the Jobs Hub, which is something I advocated for a long time, particularly when I sat here as an Independent member. I was very pleased that the Liberal Party came to the party. It is a great thing, the Jobs Hub. I think I am seeing a nod. They are doing incredibly well and good things in Glenorchy.

Then there is stamping out stamp duty for first-time home buyers of existing homes. That is saving up to $28,935 for Tasmanians. We have the My Home Shared Equity Program and cost-of-living relief in this Budget, which amounts to more than $550 million. It is no small feat, and I really do commend this effort, as it helps and assists Tasmanians right across this great state, but it does not stop there.

In Health - and I would like to take this opportunity to recognise both ministers Jaensch and Petrusma for their important contribution - there is an additional $880 million over the next four years, it is a substantial investment. Put quite simply, $9.8 million is invested each and every day in our health system and we know that not all health related issues are visible, so when it comes to mental health services, the Budget provides a boost of $44 million over four years to support mental health services critically, timely and wanted by Tasmanians. I could list the items of this Budget to the nth degree, but it would take a little time to explore closer to home. I want to do that for my electorate of Clark.

Like all in this House, I really am privileged to represent the people of my electorate in Clark. It is a really diverse electorate, even though not huge geographically. Everybody loves to say that their electorates are the best in the state, but I truly believe mine is and the people in it are the best of the best. I was born and raised here, New Town, I went to school in Claremont and also North Hobart before heading up to Hobart College, so I have traversed the educational offerings of the electorate, including a stint at UTAS. I am really pleased this Budget delivers for Clark, including redevelopment of the Royal Hobart Hospital as well as expanding the emergency department, our new public diagnostic breast care centre and Cancer Wellness Centre. I would like to underscore the work that this government is doing for women's health and for women more generally.

More beds at the St Johns Park Health and Wellbeing Precinct, new park and ride facilities at Claremont in the north of my electorate, as I mentioned before, and innovation hub investment - super exciting - to support innovative growth businesses and start-ups. These are really the future of our great state. Investment to develop our circular economy and reduce landfill through the Waste and Resource Recovery Strategy, which, I note, for some bizarre reason, Labor want to stop - I do not know why you would want to stop recycling, that is just bizarre - and support for the Hobart Women's Shelter and Bethlehem House facility: incredibly important.

It is all happening in Clark. A couple of things that are very important to me and my electors in Clark include, as I have said, the Glenorchy Jobs Hub, the wonderful GASP! boardwalk that we started, and I think the repair of Davey Street and the new work at that intersection has made it much safer and it is flowing better, particularly for those who live in Fern Tree and head up that road. I used to worry very much about the kids on the motorbikes, on their L and P plates because the divots in that road were so dangerous. It has been fixed, and the families can feel just a little bit safer as they head up the hill from day-to-day.

I will turn to the science and technology portfolio, which is an amazing portfolio. It is wonderful to have Innovation, Science and the Digital Economy encapsulated in that, and we have just seen a huge momentum and trajectory of innovation in Tasmania and globally in relation to the digital economy.

I am very passionate about this space. My people do an incredible job, and as the minister responsible I am committed to delivering alongside industry, together with industry and the community, to advance our capabilities and our potential. This Budget delivers $93.8 million of funding for ICT support, projects and programs to modernise Tasmania's government service delivery infrastructure. This operates in a matrixed way through government; its government is a complex organisation that delivers many different services and through many different parts of its organisation. We are very pleased to see so many interesting projects through to essential projects being delivered.

There is a win for local technology businesses who will have the opportunity to support government rolling these investments out, so that is excellent news. The major projects and programs that I have on my list, and I am sure you would have some more, just to encapsulate those quickly: digital health transformation, $28 million; Digital Transformation Priority Expenditure programs, $25 million; Project Unify, $18 million; and Human Resources Transformation Project, $18 million. With these projects and programs, our government is setting up the Tasmanian public service to modernise and to take advantage of our digital future to ensure the Tasmanian government can improve the delivery of services, and to provide 'anytime, anywhere' services to all Tasmanians.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.6_D=29.4_C=0.83] We have also invested in our Digital Future Strategy to ensure that Tasmanian communities, businesses and public services are well equipped to adopt and adapt to new technologies, which is the future. Digital health transformation delivers better health outcomes and delivers them faster by improving access to health care at home and across Tasmania's geographically dispersed population, with the goal of removing paper-based systems, giving health workers [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.1_D=25.3_C=0.79]  more time to care for patients and delivering safer and more accurate health care in clinical settings. 

The Digital Transformation Priority Expenditure program funds ICT initiatives aimed at modernising the government's service delivery. That is everything that we are talking about - modernising our systems and processes, making people's jobs easier and more rewarding so that they can do the things they really want to do and that matter to all Tasmanians.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=86.2_D=9.2_C=0.55] We are strengthening cybersecurity, and it is important to ensure that we are well equipped to adopt and adapt to these new technologies. AI is coming. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=95.7_D=29.9_C=0.88]  In 2025-26, the digital transformation priority expenditure program provided funding for many new projects. I have a sample of them here: EPA information management systems upgrade, gaming and licensing, information system replacement, storage access, digital transformation - this one I love - Tasmanian air quality monitoring network refurbishment and upgrade - many years in the making, but we are going to do that. It is really important and it provides base-level data for so many of the [Bookmark: Phr6_O=125.7_D=27.0_C=0.75]  things that we know and love about Tasmania. The Human Resources Transformation project will replace multiple installations of ageing HR resource management systems across government with a common system, and on it goes. We will continue to fund existing and ongoing projects like common ticketing, cyber hubs, Justice Connect, live scan, and photo track replacement. We have done a huge amount of work in cyber security, as you will be aware [Bookmark: Phr7_O=153.0_D=4.1_C=0.82] , and we want to build on those existing capabilities in that space.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=157.6_D=29.5_C=0.78] Another passion project of mine - there was some mirth when, about a decade ago, at a Tasmania ICT function I said, 'We are going to have a space sector.' There was a little bit of giggling around the room, but now we do. Our university owns an array of radio telescopes. We are fully engaged in space situational awareness, satellite communications and telephony has gone up there into the stars and satellite. It is important we are ahead of that. We are part of that global GPS system.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=188.3_D=29.3_C=0.81] The STEM capability at our Sandy Bay campus is essential. I cannot tell you how important it is for us all to get behind that. That is where the leaders and technologists and STEM people of the future will come from. They will come out of that degree with their engineering capabilities and set up businesses, work for big businesses, go to work overseas in digital and technology and bring those skills home. I am so excited about what that will mean for our portfolio.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=218.3_D=29.4_C=0.78] In the Environment portfolio, which I love - I mentioned before, I was here during the 'no dams' cases. I remember a big rally on the lawn out there in the 1980s, and my stepfather, who was a lawyer, was heavily involved in all of that work. While we focus on all the distractions and the negativity, there are some good things that are going on. I want to say that, as a government, we like to see things which are backed by science, driven by the community and grounded in our plan for Tasmania's future. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=248.3_D=29.4_C=0.76]  We are doing some critical programs through our Threatened Species Fund - $2.1 million for the Maugean skate captive breeding program, which has been very successful, over 4000 individuals; $1 million to save the Swift Parrot - so beautiful - $2.5 million for a new Orange-bellied parrot breeding facility, contributing to a four-fold increase in wild population; ongoing support for the wonderful devil; and we are backing the handfish pro [Bookmark: Phr12_O=277.9_D=27.0_C=0.73] gram. We have a range of threatened species partnership grants - masked owls, Tasmanian devils, Forty-spotted pardalote, Morrisby's gum and Southport heath.

We are not just doing things with protected species, we are recycling. We have had the amazing success of the Recycle Rewards program. I think we are up to about 5 million eligible containers that have been deposited. I have about a million in my kitchen waiting to go in, so I am pretty sure we will hit 10 million before you know it. It is good; we are getting plastic off the streets and out of our oceans and it is being recycled. The kids love it, plus communities and charities are benefiting from it, so please, I encourage everybody to get on board with it. 

We have regional organisations that are working hard, and we are strengthening the EPA with a $21.52 million investment that upgrades the EPA's information systems. This is good - enhanced capacity, continued leadership and environmental response, including the Lake Rosebery oil spill and the salmon mortality event. I thank them for that and their leadership.

We are working on climate change. We have recently released a raft of information and documents where we are working closely with the sector and community. We are making it easier for people to get on their e-bikes, and also charging stations are being rolled out.

Arts and screen - my background in the creative sector fuels my passion for the arts, from my early days of playing the oboe in the youth orchestra - I know everybody is sick of hearing about that - to my days as an IP lawyer when I was helping artists as well. I am thrilled to share that the 2025-26 Budget allocates nearly $13 million to TMAG with an additional $4 million over the forward Estimates. We love TMAG and we want to do so much more. 

More than $17 million has been invested in arts and screen: Ten Days on the Island; Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra; Theatre Royal; grants programs from Arts Tasmania; and, importantly, film. We are doing so well with film, and that is part of our digital economy. Bay of Fires, season 2; Alone Australia, season 3; A Girl's Guide to Hunting, Fishing and Wild Cooking, season 2; and the Netflix production The Survivors, which airs on Friday 6 June. Super exciting. We are well known for this now so it is always wonderful to have the nation's film leaders down here playing with us in our beautiful island state and making movies.

Our game developers require and demand a huge shout out. The games sector is actually a larger business sector than the film industry, and we are doing incredible work there. We have launched a few things that we will build upon, but can I mention specifically Secret Lab, which is at the heart and the core of this, and the UTAS STEM precinct is part of that as well.

We all love heritage. A huge amount of money into heritage from us. We have so many World Heritage listed sites, and we have been able to put $4.5 million into our Built Heritage Grants Scheme, which is for everyday people to apply for, to see what they can do to restore that church or help with that tiny museum they might want to have.

I am the Minister for Corrections and Rehabilitation as well. That always seems to come towards the tail end, but what I will say is that we are doing some incredible work there with rehabilitation and recidivism. A couple of the projects - just to pick the eyes out of it - we are redoing the communication system within Risdon to make it safer and better for the workforce, who are incredible. We are also looking at implementing a better Wi-Fi system, which will support My Tablets in Cells pilot, which for the first time will take tablets into cells so that those in custody, with appropriate supervision and controls, can do some study, can work on their literacy, can talk to their children, can engage with their lawyers and can facilitate a fair connection into the justice system. This will be game-changing, as it has been in New South Wales. I thank New South Wales for their support.

We are also delivering another passion project of mine, which is a $10-million kitchen facility at Risdon. That facility is magnificent, and I cannot tell you how pleased I am to see the contemporary, modern approach coming on board. It will allow people to provide training as well as fresh food and healthy food to everybody. I believe we have about 70 minimum security prisoners, including in dedicated training facilities, who will be employed there.

There is optimism; there is good news. Everything is able to be worked upon well and we will continue to deliver for the people of Tasmania.
Time expired.

[5.17 p.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise this afternoon and provide my response to the Budget. Over the weeks ahead, we will provide our prosecution of the particulars in the Budget through the Estimates process. I look forward to observing the exchanges of others and participating in that process myself, because that is when we can get down to the core of the honesty of the issues before us. There is no doubt the blatant disregard for the honesty required in question time no longer serves this state. When members of government stand in this place and talk about their delight and pride in their Budget, they undermine the credibility of Tasmania within our state, nationally and internationally because it is full of so many untruths. 

This government has given up. It has given up the will to govern and lead, and also given up the ability to be honest. It has given up on Tasmanians. It is no longer okay for anyone in Tasmania to support this government. We know that Tasmanians are no longer fooled. We know Tasmanians are now clear about the financial position the state finds itself in and we know that Tasmanians have had enough. If this government have no capability, willingness or commitment to presenting the financial position of Tasmania in an honest way, it is our job to scrutinise that through the Estimates.

There are simple things in this Budget that you ask the Treasurer, you ask the Premier, you ask ministers about, and they either intentionally provide misinformation or they do not understand the reality of how the Budget works. Just this morning in Question Time, there were serious questions posed to the Premier which the Tasmanian people want real answers to because they are issues that affect their daily lives, whether it be in their homes or workplaces, as workers or as business owners. This government needs to start being realistic about how it speaks to Tasmanians. 

We know that budgets, year on year, misrepresent the financial position of Tasmania. We call this out year on year and this government continues to ignore that, but the evidence is in the papers. It has been outlined very clearly by our leader, shadow treasurer and deputy leader the types of misinformation that get presented in these budgets. We know that, year on year, the budget papers are handed down and do not honestly reflect what this government already knows will be the financial outcomes for the year. 

Let me use evidence in the budget papers as an example of the government's dishonesty with the budget. We know already that the government will not be able to keep the budget it has handed down. Budget papers, for those who are not aware how it works, present the estimated budget for the year you are about to go into and also have a thing called the forward Estimates, which is the four years advanced in that budget. Every year, that will be revised based on the understanding of the government and Treasury, and advice they put together. In 2022, the Liberals said there would be an operating surplus of $126 million. What happens through a financial year is that there are revisions. There is a half-year revision and at any time that anything material happens, the government can bring forward papers to the parliament. 

At the first review, that $126 million was revised down to $32 million - still in a surplus, but revised. At the next year, there was a further revision down to a $148 million deficit. In 2022, they said the budget would be $126 million in surplus; they revised that down to $32 million; and then, in the next year, it was revised to a deficit of $148 million. You add in the mid-year budget update, the election spending from the Liberals and all of the other revisions and, in this year, that has become a deficit of $1.3 billion. In 2022, this government fronted the community and said, 'There will be $126 million of operating surplus in this year', but the reality is that they have blown that out and revised that, year on year, to a $1.3 billion deficit.

If it was a once-off and they just had a bad year, and they had to keep correcting it over time, you might give them a free pass. However, this happens year on year. We also know that at the half-year reviews, when the government needs to come back and correct its poor assumptions, there will be a difference between what it has printed in the budget papers and the reality of what will happen at the actuals at the end of the year. It is not good enough for this government to be blatantly untrue to the Tasmanian people when it knows that this is going to happen. 

Talking about blatant untruths, this morning the Premier could not answer simple questions like: if you have a credible pathway back to surplus, tell [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=30.0_C=0.85]  us the year the debt will stop increasing? If you are aware of how you are tracking your budget, you will know that date. It will be emblazoned in your mind because you would be under so much pressure worrying about Tasmania's ballooning debt. However, the Premier and the Treasurer cannot answer the question about when the deficits continue to increase and that is not good enough. 

We also know that on his feet this morning the Premier [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.4_D=25.5_C=0.78]  tried to present a positive situation about the status of our credit ratings. He actually said this morning that Moody's was at Aa2 and Standard and Poor's was at AA+. This government does not always not tell the truth, but they do not tell all the information. If you actually credibly reported the position of our credit ratings and the [Bookmark: Phr4_O=86.7_D=2.7_C=0.74]  concern that has been expressed by these [Bookmark: Phr5_O=89.9_D=15.0_C=0.81]  rating organisations, you would know that Tasmania's position has gone from stable to negative; and that once this Budget has been handed down, those organisations will continue to review Tasmania's position and will restate their thinking. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=105.2_D=16.3_C=0.89]  

As our credit ratings deteriorate, our interest costs increase. Therefore, the amount given in the budget papers that Tasmania will pay over time, not to pay down the debt but what we pay to maintain [Bookmark: Phr7_O=123.3_D=12.5_C=0.85]  payments against those debts, will continue to increase. The Premier was asked that question and could not tell us what he thought the increase on that would be. 

In order to be a credible premier, in order to be a credible treasurer [Bookmark: Phr8_O=136.3_D=15.3_C=0.92] , you need not only to understand the paperwork you are dealing with, but you also need to be honest about it. Do not just cherry-pick words or concepts, but take on the responsibility of the 11 years of mismanagement that you have delivered [Bookmark: Phr9_O=151.8_D=16.2_C=0.88]  and share with the Tasmanian community what you are going to do about correcting that. 

As we believe, unfortunately, the government is not doing that because it can see that it cannot correct the mess it has created - and not just over the last 11 years. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=168.3_D=29.8_C=0.87]  Time and time again - and just today, Mr Abetz was the most recent person to state it - the government uses the emotional permission of COVID to define why its debt and deficits are so bad. It pulls on the Tasmanian people who collectively, us included, said that at that period of time there was a reasonableness with the significant spending that occurred to protect Tasmanians. However, that is long past. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=198.3_D=29.7_C=0.88]  The debts that this government came into when it entered government and the responsible debts that went through in the COVID period are no longer at play. 

We know that while this Premier has been the leader of a minority government, the financial situations of Tasmanians and Tasmania, our economy and our people, have worsened. This Premier has stood across the worst three financial outcomes in Tasmania's history. This Premier has driven the debt and driven the [Bookmark: Phr12_O=228.3_D=29.8_C=0.84]  deficit so deep that it will be almost impossible for a future government to correct. This Premier, the Treasurer, this government are sending Tasmanians broke to the point where it is possible that Tasmania will need a bailout. 

When you talk about the reputation and credibility of Tasmania, there are amazing people in this state doing things of international importance who are working against the wall of this government, against the inaction of [Bookmark: Phr13_O=258.4_D=30.0_C=0.87]  this government to do well in Tasmania. What we need is a government that will lead honestly, that will be credible and that will make sure it does not add more pressure to the Tasmanian people and the Tasmanian business environment. That is something that Tasmanian Labor offers. Tasmanian Labor stands here ready to act for Tasmania to fix the mess of this government over generations. There is no doubt that a mess that has been created over 11 years, most significantly [Bookmark: Phr14_O=288.5_D=16.5_C=0.85]  in the last three, will take time to correct. It will require considered, thoughtful, active responses in a way that this government has been unable to do. We know that because the Liberals have given up, because they cannot manage money, that people have lost trust in them, but what Labor have said that we will do is be responsible with the budget but aggressive in the economy.

This government, this morning and in recent times, speaks as though it has created and generated about $30 billion worth of potential investment in Tasmania in terms of a pipeline of the future for activating our economy. However, we know much of that is in the renewable energy space and this government has sat on its hands and not taken the action required to deliver those investments in Tasmania. Much of that investment is in regional Tasmania, the part of Tasmania that needs support in their economy.

Our Tasmanian people need that support. Yes, there have been recent announcements, wowsers. Can you imagine how long it has taken and how patient capital has been in Tasmania? Recently, there was a positive announcement about the support of Abel Energy, Zen Energy at Bell Bay, but announcements are not enough. What we know about this government is that it continues to make announcements but does not back it up with action. One of the critical pieces of infrastructure required to actually deliver outcomes in that area is water infrastructure, and where on one hand, this government makes positive announcements just in time for a for a budget week, just in time for scrutiny, where they have done nothing up until this point, they make announcements, but can they follow it up with action?

I know that the farmers of the Tamar Valley have been waiting for a long time for confirmation of this in order to support their Tamar Valley Irrigation Scheme, but we have different conversations occurring in the community with different sectors and different levels of confidence that this government can actually deliver that. Tasmanian Labor stands ready to support our renewable energies. We continue to support our traditional industries, our salmon industry, and aquaculture. We support mining and forestry. We are ready to continue to activate the economy, particularly in regional Tasmania, because we know that is what it is going to take to fix the mess of this government.

In the north of the state, talking about our northern economy, one of the things that Tasmania is seeking to do is to ensure that we support safe, well-paid, secure jobs. We know that, in the winter months, economies are much more difficult. Tasmanian Labor, in our leader's Budget Reply Speech, announced $20 million of redirected savings to ensure that we can stimulate the outcome for the Conference Centre in Launceston. There has been a mountain of work done by our local chamber, by the council, by different peak bodies that understand the importance of our tourism dollar, our business events dollar, our night-time economy dollar, and what that does in a community like northern Tasmania - because a Conference Centre based in Launceston does not just support the city; it supports the region. It supports a range of different sectors and, most importantly, it supports the community with good ongoing jobs. 

We have seen the benefit of the Bacon vision of having football in the north at York Park and what that did in our winter months with the attraction of Hawthorn. We know how vital that is, and we know, in future years that is going to be critical to continue. The savings we have found by the wasteful spending of this government can be redirected. A large amount of savings and a small amount of money redirected to support the Launceston Conference Centre is key to the support that Tasmanian Labor want to provide to the northern economy, like the critical work that should be happening at Bell Bay regarding the offshore renewable terminal.

We know that if work is done as a matter of urgency to complete a business case, to present for financing, that the offshore terminal at Bell Bay will be critical for the economic changes in the north. We know that it is not just about the Bass Strait zone for renewable energy; it is about all of the offshore zones across the greater Bass Strait area. Not just George Town, not just northern Tasmania, but the whole Tasmanian economy will benefit from this. It requires a determination and a focus on getting that work done in order that we can start receiving components in 2029.

When you have a Conference Centre, when you have Bell Bay activated, we know that will make a difference in Tasmania. One of the challenges of delivering these outcomes has been navigating and seeking to find the leadership between ReCFIT and the office of the coordinator-general. Today, Tasmanian Labor also announced Invest Tas. Invest Tas, taking the model from South Australia, who have been doing such a good job at progressing their economy of a similar scale to Tasmania; we know that by bringing those entities together, by making it simpler and clearer about who will lead investment in Tasmania, for new investment and existing businesses to grow, it is clearer, and therefore more likely, that more timely outcomes are given of support for new investment.

There is, quite rightly, almost $30 billion worth of investment opportunity waiting in the wings to be landed in Tasmania but for the lack of action, the lack of clarity and the lack of ability of this government to capture that and deliver it, Tasmanians are waiting. Capital is not always patient and right now we know that Tasmania needs a government that can actually deliver on those different outcomes. 

Tasmanian Labor knows that. Tasmania needs a government whose top priority is creating safe, protective, full-time, secure jobs. We know that Tasmania needs a government that will get developments and big projects moving. We know that Tasmania needs a government that will modernise our health system and our other systems in Tasmania. We know Tasmania deserves a government that, under intense challenges, will be able to correct the budget that this government has broken. We know that Tasmania needs a government that will deliver on economic growth, but at the moment we have a government that has given up. We have a government that it appears is potentially intentionally destroying the budget in Tasmania to make it almost impossible for a future government to fix. It is no longer okay for this government to pretend that everything is okay because while they continue to pretend, Tasmanians are hurting.
We know that in our community sector the extraordinary exchange that happened at the end of last week between our community sector at the TasCOSS meeting and the government, where the government seemed to have this unbelievable attitude that if you do not like what you have then just give up on it.

How can you ask our Tasmanian community sector to stand down from their support of Tasmanians as we are leading into the chapter of winter? At this time of year we know that more Tasmanians more often are needing more help. It is incumbent on all of us who can do the right thing to support Tasmanians to ensure they are secure and safe and warm and fed, not only through the winter months but all through the year, because then they can have strong relationships with family, strong relationships with friends, and have the opportunity to continue to engage in work or in education. We know that there are families and children struggling right now under the pressures of this government.

This government has an agenda of privatisation. We know that the outcome of privatisation will see increasing power prices increase even more drastically. That puts pressure on households. We know that privatisation puts pressure on our public transport system, will increase prices when Tasmanians are having more difficulty getting around in the community to access the essential services.

Tasmanian Labor stands committed, has a plan to generate great economic activity in Tasmania and to support the community and the people who need it most. This government needs to take a strong look at themselves. This government needs to start being honest with Tasmanians about the reality of the circumstances that it has created. This government needs to understand what it means to have responsible management. Tasmanian Labor seeks to responsibly manage a government. Tasmanian Labor seeks to aggressively grow the economy, to support Tasmanians not only in our cities but right across regional Tasmania. Tasmanian Labor is here ready to create safe, secure, well-paid jobs. We are here ready to get Tasmania building again.

We are here ready to modernise our hospital and our public services, to deliver for the region, be responsible with the budget and aggressive with the economy.

[5.36 p.m.]
Ms HOWLETT (Lyons - Minister for Primary Industries and Water) - Honourable Speaker, this government is focused on delivering and building a strong Tasmania now and into the future: a budget that continues to deliver a 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future. We have a strong economy which is growing. It is now worth more than $40.6 billion but to ensure that government can support and care for Tasmanians, we need to keep building and growing a strong economy.

Our plan is to make Tasmania the best place to live, work, raise a family, invest and do business. This Budget backs businesses, creates jobs, supports families and builds stronger and safer communities, but it also delivers a sensible pathway to surplus without increasing taxes, something I noted that the opposition leader will not rule out in his contribution. It gets the balance right with a vision towards a future of the state.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=6.4_D=16.7_C=0.90] In my portfolio of Racing, the 2025-26 Budget drives the delivery of a 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future by supporting measures to improve integrity, animal welfare and the overall wellbeing of the industry. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=24.0_D=17.5_C=0.84]  The government has delivered the biggest reforms to the racing industry in decades, following the passage of the Racing Regulation and Integrity Bill 2024 and the Racing Regulation and Integrity Consequential Amendments Bill 2024 late this year. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=42.4_D=13.7_C=0.85]  This new legislation, which came into effect on 1 February this year, provides a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose model for regulation and integrity, abolishing the old framework. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=56.8_D=27.8_C=0.86]  This new model is strongly supported in the 2025-26 Budget.

As we continue to support the industry that employs thousands of Tasmanians across all three codes, we are resourcing the independent office of the Tasmanian Racing Integrity Commissioner to oversee the administration and regulation of the Tasmanian racing industry. We have already seen the important work of the new commissioner and his team [Bookmark: Phr6_O=85.4_D=5.3_C=0.83] , for example, a recent multi-agency inspection of a training premises in March of this year [Bookmark: Phr7_O=91.3_D=1.6_C=0.90] , convened by the Commissioner. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=94.2_D=10.6_C=0.92]  The Budget includes $720,000 across four years to support the new Racing Integrity Committee, a critical entity in the new reform model.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=105.5_D=30.0_C=0.79] We are ensuring that Tasracing is appropriately resourced to deliver its new functions under this framework. Our reforms are based on evidence and industry best practice. They provide a solid platform to build the confidence of participants and the community in the Tasmanian racing industry. 

Importantly, the 2025-26 Budget also contains continued funding for initiatives to support the industry and the [Bookmark: Phr10_O=135.8_D=1.2_C=0.20]  Tasmanians who work within it [Bookmark: Phr11_O=137.9_D=9.6_C=0.83] , including workforce development and renewal through our election commitment for Tasmanian stewards to have access to professional development and training [Bookmark: Phr12_O=148.7_D=10.4_C=0.82]  and further support for the successful Cadet Stewards' program as stewards need the skills and knowledge required to maintain the rules and the integrity of racing.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=159.8_D=29.8_C=0.83] A healthy racing industry requires a strong and vibrant breeding sector. The Tasmanian breeding industry supports job creation and economic activity, particularly in regional Tasmania. The government continues to support the Thoroughbred Initiative Scheme and for the harness breeding initiatives and our commitment to animal welfare initiatives, including continued funding to ensure that Tasracing meets its Greyhound Adoption [Bookmark: Phr14_O=190.6_D=3.4_C=0.79]  Program target to rehome 150 dogs a year. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=195.1_D=14.8_C=0.86]  This Budget demonstrates our strong support for this valuable industry, which generates more than $208 million in economic activity and involves more than 6400 people right across our state.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=211.2_D=11.2_C=0.84] The 2025-26 Budget is also delivering for our farmers and our agricultural sector, a key driver of our economy and our way of life. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=223.2_D=7.9_C=0.87]  Agriculture is a huge part of our economy, and this Liberal government knows it is, which is why we always back in our farmers. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=232.0_D=17.7_C=0.85]  The most recent Agri Food Scorecard showed the value of packed and processed food in Tasmania at more than $6 billion. This contribution to the Tasmanian economy should not be underplayed and the Budget continues to deliver for our farmers.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=250.5_D=10.5_C=0.88] The budget papers show a total investment of over $351 million in irrigation development in partnership with the Australian Government. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=261.9_D=24.7_C=0.85]  This significant investment includes $63.7 million of the state's $75 million commitment to the $300 million Greater Southeast Scheme. This scheme will provide a highly reliable supply of irrigation water to what is one of the driest areas in the state, driving new on farm investment and more jobs in agriculture. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=287.9_D=16.9_C=0.82]  Our state's commitment is partnered with over $232 million from the Australian Government's National Water Grid Fund to fund our vital irrigation infrastructure projects and I acknowledge and recognise this important partnership once again with the federal government.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=5.8_D=16.8_C=0.88] The Budget also provides $1.5 million to continue the important Agricultural Research and Development Fund, delivered in partnership with the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture (TIA), on top of ongoing core funding to research initiatives.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=23.5_D=25.8_C=0.75] TIA has welcomed the Budget's commitment, saying in a social media post, 

This investment by the Tasmanian government will back innovation, industry-led research that delivers real on-farm impact for our state's Agri food producers. It is all about turning smart ideas into practical solutions and growing a stronger, more sustainable future for Tasmanian agriculture. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=49.9_D=5.4_C=0.86]  

Practical on-farm benefits and turning smart ideas into practical solutions. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=55.8_D=3.2_C=0.87]  That is what we want to see on this side of the House.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=59.8_D=29.7_C=0.76] The Budget also supports Tasmania's organisations with the delivery of community and regionally based education, mentoring and employment initiatives, including career pathways in agriculture. Rural Business Tasmania has welcomed the Budget. Elizabeth Skirving, CEO of Rural Business Tasmania, said -

Rural Business Tasmania acknowledges the 2025-26 Tasmanian State Budget's commitment to supporting the state's [Bookmark: Phr7_O=89.8_D=28.0_C=0.69]  agriculture sector, small businesses and rural and regional communities and we are pleased that the Rockliff Liberal government has continued to support programs that bolster small businesses and primary industries. 

The Budget also includes $444,000 to support rolling out the Rural Water Use Strategy. This funding will ensure we have good freshwater management information [Bookmark: Phr8_O=118.7_D=5.0_C=0.65] , complementing other key projects like developing water security strategies [Bookmark: Phr9_O=124.0_D=8.4_C=0.84]  for King and Flinders islands especially as we continue to monitor our response to ongoing dry seasonal conditions.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=134.1_D=26.6_C=0.78] We are continuing our ongoing support for managing invasive species, including funding to nature resource managers and for wildlife management, and investing more funding in the reduction of wild fallow deer numbers. The Budget includes $2.25 million to continue delivering the government's Tasmanian Wild Fallow Deer Management Plan 2022 - 2027. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=161.3_D=6.6_C=0.66]  The plan outlines how and where deer are to be sustainably managed, [Bookmark: Phr12_O=168.3_D=5.2_C=0.82]  including a hunting resource and where they should be eradicated across Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr13_O=174.4_D=29.0_C=0.85] , with initiatives to provide more land access for recreational hunting, to help manage deer numbers in conjunction with private land managers and farmers, and improved access management tools, to help farmers and help protect our environmentally sensitive parks and reserves. 

This year's budget also complements a significant investment for agriculture in the 2024-25 Budget delivered in September last year. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=204.2_D=2.8_C=0.67]  Investments continue to bear fruit, including [Bookmark: Phr15_O=207.6_D=16.8_C=0.90]  almost $13 million to bolster biosecurity, including frontline services, $1.5 million to support growth and sustainability in Tasmanian wine production with 2025 harvest now expected to reach record levels [Bookmark: Phr16_O=225.2_D=23.9_C=0.81] , and $2.5 million to assist peak bodies and agricultural organisations like Sprout Tasmania and TasFarmers to support producers and agribusinesses through the successful Strategic Industry Partnership Program. We are building a better agriculture sector right now and for the future and backing economic growth.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=251.2_D=29.2_C=0.83] I have always understood that small business is the engine room of our economy. I am passionate about small business because that is where I have come from. With plenty of small business experience on this side of the Chamber, we will always back them to the hilt. In the Budget there is over $2.5 million to support small businesses, and this includes $500,000 to establish a new small business startup permit process. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=281.5_D=19.4_C=0.85]  This is an exciting step for Tasmania. It will allow low-risk businesses to get started and slowly acquire the permits that they need for ongoing operations. If businesspeople are keen to take risk and support our economy, we want to help them to do that. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=301.7_D=3.3_C=0.76]  Drafting of legislation is well underway and I am looking forward to releasing that for consultation and discussion as soon as it is ready. There is $700,000 allocated towards red tape reduction and small business initiatives to streamline processes for small businesses and support the delivery of the Small Business Growth Strategy 2026. 

The budget support has been welcomed by the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Small Business Council of Tasmania as important investment into our small business sector. There is $500,000 in funding for the Rapid Response Fund to efficiently support Tasmanian businesses in times of business or industry disruption with financial assistance or advisory services. There is additional funding of $150,000 to support the Tasmanian Business Advice Service, providing existing small businesses with access to free annual advice, supporting their viability and their growth, recognising the fact that small businesses operate and work on their businesses outside of nine to five. 

There is $100,000 to fund the online Business Advice Platform to allow businesses to access advice and online resources at a time that suits them, and also to assist businesses to manage disruptions in response to emergency events. There is $50,000 for the online Business Continuity Planning Tool. We are providing our small businesses with advice and resources that are fit for purpose, modern and flexible, and providing them with the tools to continue to grow and be more sustainable.

This Budget is also continuing to deliver on our strong plan for the hospitality industry. The 2025-26 Budget delivers ongoing funding for our partnership with the sector through the Hospitality 2030 Strategy, a long-term plan for the hospitality sector. We continue our investment into the programs run by the THA, such as the Greater Customer Experience Program; funding for Clubs Tasmania; the Women in Leadership Scholarship Program, which has funded 40 scholarships for leadership training for women working in hospitality; the Hospital Health Program; ongoing research into food waste practices and production by industry; the Local Food on Local Plates project; and delivering accredited mental health first aid training. 

There is continued support for the Tasmanian Hospitality and Tourism Academy to provide short courses to address skills and labour shortages. In the words of the Tasmanian Hospitality Association (THA) CEO, Steve Old:

The Budget reaffirms the government's commitment to the sector, especially in key areas such as workforce development, regional support and community programs, recognising its vital role in Tasmania's economy and community life.

On this side of the House, we understand and value the important contribution that both the hospitality industry and the small business sector make to the Tasmanian economy, and we reflect that in this Budget.

As a previous minister for Women, I was pleased to support the development of the Tasmanian Gender Budget Statement, so I welcome this year's statement. The government's vision is for a Tasmania where women and girls have access to equal choice, opportunity and resources to participate in our economic, social, political and community life, and where equity is embedded into our culture, attitudes and practices, recognising the diversity of Tasmanian women and girls. As parliamentarians, we should all continue to work hard to deliver on this vision for the sake of Tasmanian women and girls and the broader strength of our community. 

The Gender Budget Statement analyses key gender equity data insight to reveal trends occurring across the state. I was interested to learn through the Women in Tasmanian Data Snapshot that 28.8 per cent of Tasmanian women had attained a bachelor's degree or higher, in contrast to only 22.8 per cent of males. Importantly, too, the analysis of the economic security section showed that the gender pay gap three-year trend measure was improving, and that Tasmania's performance in this important measure when compared with national results was also getting better.

In Lyons, the Budget delivers important investment into the many urban and regional communities that make up my electorate. The Budget is focused on delivery and building a strong Tasmania now and into the future. This is especially important to me. Roads and bridges are a valuable freight, commuter and tourist connection across my electorate. The Budget prioritises vital infrastructure projects, including:

the duplication of the Midway Point and Sorell causeways and the Tasman Highway between the Hobart Airport interchange and the Midway Point causeway;

the replacement of the Sorell Rivulet bridge;

further upgrades to the Lyell Highway between Granton and Strahan;

completion of the final upgrade to the Midland Highway north of Campbell Town, the final part of the transformation of our north-south highway connection;

vital works across the east coast on really important roads like St Marys Pass;

the Great Eastern Drive including between Bicheno and Coles Bay Road;

upgrades to north of Triabunna;

upgrades between Pontypool and Rocky Hills; and

upgrades to the Arthur Highway.

There are other significant investments across Lyons in health, education and keeping Tasmanians safe, including building the Northern Heart Centre, a new dedicated mental health precinct at the LGH; a new ambulance station at Longford; upgrading Dodges Ferry Primary School, Campbell Town District High School, Deloraine High School; the Midlands Multi-Purpose Health Centre Upgrade; and investing in the Bridgewater Police Station.

I was incredibly proud to attend the official opening of the new Bridgewater Bridge on the weekend. The new bridge is a huge testament to the fact that we can deliver on big infrastructure projects, in partnership with the private sector, with the hardworking civil contractors, transport workers, engineers and hundreds and hundreds of other Tasmanian business workers, and their families who have benefited from this amazing build. The $786 million project represents a significant investment in Tasmania's future. The new four-lane bridge will deliver faster, more reliable travel times for commuters, freight operators and locals. It is going to serve the people of Tasmania for decades to come. It will improve safety for drivers, pedestrians and cyclists, and it includes improved access for marine traffic.

Since construction began in October 2022, the project has supported around 1000 jobs, more than 25 per cent of which were employees from the local area. It has created pathways for apprentices, trainees and people to the new civil construction industry to gain real world experience on a nationally significant construction site. It has been built with a vision towards the future of our state. So too will the Macquarie Point Urban Renewal Project, including the stadium, be built with a vision towards the future of our state.

In conclusion, I would like to thank the Treasurer, the honourable Guy Barnett and his team for their hard work.

Time expired.

[5.57 p.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to provide a response to the government's budget. One sentence a constituent said to me when I was out doorknocking about a month ago was, 'This government are not governing anymore, they are marketing', and I think that is exactly the problem that we have.

We have a record debt, nearly $11 billion, the worst budget in the history of Tasmania. That is on the back of the previous two budgets - well, this is actually even worse. We did not think it could get worse, we thought the one from three years ago was bad enough, and then we had another record deficit. Now, we have this, and it really is the worst budget ever passed in the history of Tasmania - oh, sorry, ever put up by a government in the history of Tasmania.

I look forward to Estimates next week where I will be prosecuting the abysmal budget situation of the Corrections portfolio. We have hit 62 per cent recidivism within two years, and will soon hit the $200,000 per prisoner per year mark, the most expensive in the country with the highest recidivism. There is no northern prison; a piecemeal allocation to investigate a northern remand centre [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.1_D=5.8_C=0.65] ; a veterans' portfolio without any real funding for veteran services, just bureaucracy and PR grants [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.6_D=24.6_C=0.75] ; a women's portfolio without any real funding - just a nice glossy brochure and some grants programs; the Department of Police, Fire, and Emergency Management (DPFEM) allocation has seen a massive $35-million budget cut under a minister who, after years of trialling a wellbeing roster, has made the decision to return to an antiquated 20 to 30-year-old Ottawa rostering system. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=56.9_D=7.0_C=0.72]  

The minister is more than happy to stand with police officers and get his front page spreads with media releases [Bookmark: Phr5_O=65.1_D=28.6_C=0.83] , but he is not happy to stand with them and stick up for them when it comes to their wellbeing. There are retention issues and a massive workers' compensation rate of 16 per cent with burnout. Officers want to perform their duties but have no support from this government. 

I have members from the Police Association here today. They are here because I have a series of statements which have been provided to me to read into the Hansard [Bookmark: Phr6_O=94.8_D=25.0_C=0.82]  from police officers. What these statements describe is what the wellbeing rosters meant to them in trying to find a work-life balance, and what bringing back the antiquated Ottawa system will mean for them. I am going to read these out. 

This is told from the perspective [Bookmark: Phr7_O=120.0_D=13.4_C=0.82]  of a father of young children: 

The last run of seven nights I did in November 2024 meant I ended up having a total of 23.5 hours sleep over the entire week. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=134.3_D=29.3_C=0.85]  I was required to attend court on multiple occasions during the seven nights. I always felt that I was at work and not present in my family's life. When I was home, I was asleep, grumpy, angry or not mentally present. On one occasion I don't even remember driving my eldest to school, which was a key factor in leaving 24/7 uniform work. The relief of transferring out is palpable, and it has been the best decision I've made [Bookmark: Phr9_O=163.8_D=24.6_C=0.79]  in a long time.

Told from the perspective of a mother of young children:

Considerable lack of sleep. Days where I am awake until 5.00 p.m. with the children and back at work at 11.00 p.m. Many days where I would only get three or four hours sleep, then have to get up with the kids again, parenting all day and work again that evening. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=189.1_D=4.0_C=0.90]  The simple lack of family time. My partner, also a police officer [Bookmark: Phr11_O=193.6_D=28.1_C=0.89] , would be doing the same. 
The lack of being able to build a strong relationship with our children because we are always working. There is a lack of support for each other during tough and sick times due to work. Missing out on family events including my partner's own child's baby shower, Christmas, birthdays and big holidays. The lack of being able to attend to parenting and family responsibilities. Doing seven nights can lead to issues in relationships.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=222.6_D=24.0_C=0.82] Told from the perspective of a police couple:

Working the old Ottawa with a partner also working it, which is not unusual in this profession, we would only get one day off together every five weeks.

Told from the perspective of a mother of young children:

I have worked Ottawa for over five years before doing the six-by-six roster for approximately two years. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=247.5_D=5.0_C=0.77]  Ottawa not only impacted my physical health, it impacted my mental health. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=252.9_D=29.7_C=0.84]  Not having a forward-facing roster, days, arvo and nights make it impossible for my body and mental health to recover. Leading into seven nights I was expected to work four day shifts, one day off and then seven nights. During this period it made it impossible to see my family, exercise and lead a healthy lifestyle. It was normal during night shifts to lose 3 kilograms due to stress and a lack of healthy lifestyle. Now I am a new mum to a beautiful daughter [Bookmark: Phr15_O=282.9_D=21.2_C=0.87]  going back to an outdated and unhealthy roster.

Ottawa isn't only going to affect my physical health, it's going to stop me from seeing my daughter and having crucial family time. Working Ottawa rosters significantly impacts the opportunities for maintaining a positive work/life balance and being present during important life events. This roster does not only affect me doing it; it will also affect the community. Being so sleep-deprived makes it near impossible to make safe and sound decisions while in a stressful and dangerous environment. Ottawa will also impact the response time for police to respond to emergencies as there will be fewer officers working at the one time. An Ottawa roster is not conducive to women in policing who are now encouraged to simultaneously start a family while focusing on their careers.

Told from the perspective of a single mum:

Single mom of two teenage kids who need to be present when I had them week on, week off. Seven nights would mean that I would only be able to get around five hours of poor-quality sleep per day as I am responsible for their welfare, et cetera. This is manageable on two nights, not on seven.'

Told from the perspective of a former police officer with PTSD:

As a former police officer of 32 years experience, I was often stationed in roles that required me to work a 24-hour shift rotation roster. I can tell you from personal experience how incredibly dangerous and antiquated reverting back to that roster will be. Working seven-night shifts in a row had a major impact upon my wellbeing and ability to be able to function. By the end of seven nightshifts, you were completely exhausted, drained and functioning like a drunk.

The impact upon relationships and family was huge. Trying to look after children, maintaining a functioning household while still having to attend court during the day on some of those nightshifts mean next to little or no sleep at all. Working in a high-risk role as a police officer, the seven-night shift roster was so dangerous, often performing our duties totally exhausted, having to think quickly and react accordingly when your body and mind is so fatigued.

I am not surprised that so many of us burnout, including myself. The amount of times I nearly fell asleep at the wheel driving home is too scary to count. Nightshift should not be a consecutive seven nights in a row. It impacts the body and mind far too much. It causes so many health issues and the first day after those seven nights was counted as a day off, giving you very little time to recover and readjust.

As police officers on that roster we will barely surviving ourselves, let alone performing our duties to the best of our abilities. It is an antiquated roster, extremely family unfriendly, unhealthy and dangerous. It has seen the rest of the police services in Australia move to a far more healthier roster that provides more flexibility and family-friendly, allowing members to catch up on.

Why our current police commissioner would consider reverting back to this roster again, despite all evidence contrary to the wellbeing of its members, speaks volumes about the care for its people.

Speaker, told from the perspective of a police father:

I fell asleep on the last night of Ottawa. I worked before we changed. Partner was also already asleep. The only reason I did not total my Divvy van and the parked cars on the Vines Road was because the crash alarms went off and woke me up. I did not work Ottawa with my kids. Now I have two. I remember how irritable I was on nights, not to mention totally zombified by night seven.

It does take one day to recover from nights like six-by-six, multiple days wasted trying to return to normal. My wife will essentially be a single parent for that whole week. It is not just the seven nightshifts, though; combined with the days over the weekend leading up to it, fatigue fortnight. Six-by-six is so good that I can work my six on, work an OT shift or two on days off, and still come back fully rested and ready to go.

Speaker, told from the perspective of a career police officer:

One big thing is the fatigue of the seven nights and being called into court and being made to sit there with all the criminals while you are trying your hardest to stay awake. Having to drive yourself in there and home again puts us all in a dangerous situation. The fatigue from that roster is causing us to have slower decision-making because we are tired. It is busier out there now and you are having to make decisions quick and on the go. Being tired from being on that many nightshifts will make this hard.'

Speaker, told from the perspective of a career police officer:

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=4.2_D=27.3_C=0.81] I worked the previous six-by-six trial at Glenorchy. Again, it was met with overwhelming positivity and a return to Ottawa was strongly opposed. When our son was born four years ago, we were struggling with his sleeping habits. I had seven nights coming up which were going to be impossible for my wife to get through alone while I slept through the day. My shift had nine people rostered to work that week, so I requested unplanned leave to take care of my family. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=32.0_D=4.6_C=0.69] 

There was already too high a number of people on leave for the entire station for me to have leave approved. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=37.2_D=28.5_C=0.81]  I was forced to get a medical certificate and use sick leave.

Told from the perspective of an early career constable:

I always wanted to be a police officer growing up. I was so proud to finally become one. I always intended to spend my foreseeable future as a police officer. I wanted to be a career cop. I graduated to Launceston in which I worked the four-on-four-off roster to which a large majority loved. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=66.6_D=6.3_C=0.52]  We moved to Ottawa and my enthusiasm for the job faded. Ottawa is debilitating. It's exhausting. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=73.3_D=29.9_C=0.82]  To work a roster in which your department has spent millions of dollars in research to find it is detrimental to the health and well-being to its workers, and then being placed on that roster after knowing this feels so backwards. 

I know that my career as a police officer at this rate is not viable. I will be looking for another job if we continue to work on a roster that is known to take years off your life, to a job that we get kicked, punched, spat on, assaulted, seeing things that give you [Bookmark: Phr7_O=103.4_D=30.0_C=0.84]  nightmares. We are doing too much for too little. Family life is tough. I consider myself lucky that I do not have children because I know that if I did, I would not see them. 

There is no incentive to be a police officer in Tasmania. I am proud to stand amongst my brothers and sisters at work as we do, as we are doing too much for too little. It is time we are recognised. Ottawa feels like a way to save money. We are not a business; we are a [Bookmark: Phr8_O=133.6_D=7.3_C=0.80]  resource that the vulnerable depend on. We cannot look after our community if we cannot look after ourselves.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=141.4_D=26.2_C=0.83] Told from the perspective of a mid-career constable:

I'm a police officer and have been for over five years and I have done the Ottawa roster and it nearly killed me. Approximately three years ago I was driving home from shift after nightshift. I hadn't done overtime so the hours were not an issue. However, I was exhausted and delusional from doing seven nightshifts in a row. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=168.6_D=6.3_C=0.74] 

Whilst driving home from work, I was driving along the highway when I hallucinated seeing a large bush on the road. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=175.4_D=25.9_C=0.87]  Instinctively, I swerved to avoid the bush that I thought I saw, causing me to nearly crash into the side barrier. I then continued on, slightly shaken, and approximately ten minutes later I hallucinated again thinking I saw a human on the road. At this time I slammed on my brakes thinking I was about to hit a person. I immediately knew I was not fit to drive and pulled over and waited for my partner to pick me up. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=202.2_D=6.3_C=0.84] 

Another occurrence, in the middle of my block of nightshifts, I believe three or four. I was driving [Bookmark: Phr13_O=209.1_D=25.2_C=0.80]  around conducting patrols and doing curfew checks. However, whilst driving my colleague fell asleep in the passenger seat and I unfortunately did too. I drove off the road, fortunately woken by the noise of the sidelines and the gravel hitting the wheels. Had there not been a road shoulder, I would have crashed. These are both close calls and certainly not the only occasions. However, the story could have been very different. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=235.2_D=2.8_C=0.87] 

I am afraid of going back to this roster [Bookmark: Phr15_O=238.2_D=27.4_C=0.87]  that it may kill police officers and resignations will skyrocket, causing more stress. I can't risk my mental health and physical health deteriorating again. I know as soon as it starts, which it will with this roster, I will resign. Since the six-and-six rosters have been in place, I have seen my family again many times. I have a great sleep schedule, my mental health has never been better, and I feel like I have a life outside of work. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=266.4_D=4.4_C=0.80]  I have not once hallucinated or fell asleep behind the wheel at work or after work. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=271.4_D=25.1_C=0.85]  This six-and-six roster is revolutionary and needs to be kept.

Told from the perspective of a police parent:

I've worked both rosters and I barely coped with the seven nights. That was before I had children. It completely disrupted my life. I didn't see daylight. I was constantly exhausted and no matter what I tried, my body just couldn't adjust to sleeping during the day. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=297.2_D=3.4_C=0.85]  I was burnt out and disconnected from everything outside of work. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=301.4_D=3.6_C=0.74]  When I worked for the four-by-four roster, things change for the better. I finally had balance, I had the energy to be present, not just at work but at home too. I could pick my kids up from school, spend quality time with them and actually enjoy life. I felt human again. I had a social life and mentally I was in a good place. I came back to work rested, focused, and ready. The thought of going back to seven nights is honestly overwhelming.

I do not know how mums and families are supposed to cope with that kind of pressure. It feels like we are being pushed beyond our limits. What is even harder to accept is the inequality. We are all paid by the same government, yet firefighters and ambulance officers get four-and-four and police do not. It is a slap in the face. The disparity is unfair and demoralising. It feels like we are being overlooked and it is taking a real toll.

Told from the perspective of a senior constable:

Hello, I am a senior constable and have worked the Ottawa and the six-by-six rosters. Since finding out we are returning to Ottawa, my wife has already made comment that I will not be present for almost two weeks during the nightshifts and recovery from nightshifts. I could never switch off from an Ottawa. By the time I had wound down from a block of shifts, it was time to go back to work again.

With the six-by-six, I have found that I can switch off from work and be ready and enthused to go back to work once I had enjoyed my days off. With only two days off between shift blocks, it only takes having caught on one of those days off that ruins any chance of family time. I did not have a child last time I worked Ottawa and I have serious concerns on the impacts it will have on my family and my own mental health now that I have a child and not knowing if I will spend any quality time with them.
Our job is hard. We see things normal people do not see. We need a roster that allows us to switch off and have some normality to our life.

This is told from the perspective of an early career constable:

I currently work as a constable at the Launceston Police Station. I previously worked in a trade. I joined Tasmania Police because I wanted an exciting job, where no day was the same. One of the main reasons I joined was because of the four-on-four-off roster and the great work-life balance that it delivers. I previously brought forward the idea of a four-on-four-off roster in the trade. The company I worked for shut it down every time. I heard other companies were offering this roster and contemplated moving; however, I decided to join Tasmania Police.

This is told from the perspective of a career police officer:

When I was working on Ottawa roster, I had to go to court and give evidence at the end of my seventh nightshift and we had a newborn so my sleep was all over the show. I did not get to give my evidence till 11:30 a.m. after my seventh night on nightshift and I just wanted to get it done and get out as I was so tired and I felt as though I was drunk.

These are accounts and there are so many more of them, but we only had a certain amount of time to read them into the Hansard. These are from our Tasmanian police officers. These are statements. These are people sharing what these rosters will look like to them. I really hope the Minister for Police, Felix Ellis, has actually been listening to this. I was hoping he would be in the chamber this evening, but I hope he has listened to this because I do not think he could be honestly making the decision to not bring in the six-by-six and four-by-four and the wellbeing rosters if he understood what it looks like for police officers to have to go back to the Ottawa system.

They are crying out for you to listen to them. They are crying out for you to stand with them and we will keep supporting Tasmania Police with this and we thank these police officers very much for sharing these insights into their life and we really appreciate their confidence. Thank you.

[6.17 p.m.]
Mrs PETRUSMA (Franklin - Minister for Health) - Honourable Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to speak on the budget reply and to thank and acknowledge the work of our Treasurer, Deputy Premier and Attorney-General, Guy Barnett, for our 2025-26 State Budget because it does deliver for Tasmanians now and for the future.

Now, in regard to my portfolio of Health, this Budget delivers record funding into Tasmania's health system with $14.5 billion invested across the forward Estimates. This $14.5 billion is a 12 per cent increase of $1.6 billion from last year's budget of $12.9 billion, with health now making up 34 per cent of the total budget, which is up from 32 per cent of the state budget from last year.

This $14.5 billion equates to nearly $10 million every single day into our health system, which will help deliver better care to Tasmanians when and where they need it. This record investment clearly demonstrates that health and supporting Tasmanians and their families is a top priority for our Tasmanian Liberal Government. As part of our record investment in acknowledging that demand for health services is increasing, the $14.5 billion includes an additional $880 million over the next four years specifically to meet demand on health services reflecting our ongoing commitment to ensure that Tasmanians have access to healthcare in the right place at the right time.

The 2025-26 Budget also includes $70.2 million over the next four years to implement our new Four-Year Elective Surgery Plan 2025-2029. This follows our first four-year plan which has seen a record number of elective surgeries delivered and the highest per capita admission rate for elective surgery of any state or territory. In fact, in the last financial year alone, our hospitals carried out more than 22,000 elective surgeries on top of emergency surgeries and procedures required. This targeted investment ensures we can continue this momentum so that more Tasmanians receive their healthcare and their procedures sooner.

As a Registered Nurse, I would also like to take this opportunity to recognise and thank all of our hardworking and dedicated staff and volunteers who make up our amazing health team, as well as the people who work in the Department of Health. I have seen firsthand how you all play such an integral role, caring for and supporting families, patients and their loved ones, often putting the needs of others above your own. We recognise this commitment and rest assured that the Budget backs you and the great work that you do with record investment in our healthcare services.

People are the heart of our healthcare system, and we are investing more in our healthcare workers and recruiting more staff than ever before. Tasmania already has more healthcare workers per population than any other state, thanks to the Tasmanian Liberal Government employing an additional 2,500 health workers over the past 10 years. The 2025-26 Budget continues our strong recruitment efforts, especially to ensure that Tasmanians have access to the healthcare they expect and deserve through our relocation incentives and retention incentives for nurses and midwives continuing across the forward Estimates.

Since 27 April last year to 30 May this year, we have employed 3160 healthcare workers with more nurses, more doctors, more allied health professionals and more paramedics now employed. We are also supporting our workers in the Tasmanian community with record infrastructure investment to ensure we can meet healthcare needs of the future.

As part of our $14.5 billion, the 2025-26 Budget locks in $805.42 million in the Capital Investment Program, including $663.5 million across the forward Estimates for hospital and health infrastructure, $112.8 million for digital health transformation including an extra $30 million in 2028-29 as we roll out our 10-year strategy, $24 million for medical equipment, $4.7 million for a new state-of-art surgical robot at the Launceston General Hospital for improved clinical outcomes for prostate and kidney cancers and gynaecological surgery, and $423,000 for aeromedical support. This $805.4 million investment shows we are continuing to rebuild Tasmania's major hospitals and health facilities to ensure staff and patients have access to world-class facilities and technology alongside a boosted workforce.

In the south this includes $113.3 million for upgrades and redevelopment at the Royal Hobart Hospital, including $91.6 million to deliver the expanded emergency department with a nearly 50 per cent increase in treatment points and improved patient access and flow, which is due for completion at the end of 2027; $14 million to complete the new Public Diagnostic Breast Cancer Centre which will provide almost 5000 additional appointments in 2025-26, increasing to almost 10,000 additional appointments in 2026-27; $213 million for a new cardiology angiography machine; as well as $3 million to complete the pharmacy redevelopment which is due soon.

There is also $2.58 million to complete other redevelopment works at the Royal Hobart Hospital. As well, there is $110.45 million to progress the St Johns Park Health and Wellbeing Precinct, including $70 million for an older person's mental health facility; $33.7 million for child and adolescent mental health inpatient unit and day facility; and $6.45 million for a dedicated eating disorders treatment centre.

In my electorate of Franklin, I am very pleased that the Budget locks in funding for the Stage 2 of the Kingston Health Centre, which is to provide increased community health facilities for this growing region, with construction scheduled to be completed in early 2027. 

In the north there is $284.67 million across the forward Estimates, including funding towards the redevelopment of the Launceston General Hospital, with $13.9 million to complete stage 1 works of the redevelopment including the construction of a new multi-storey car park. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.6_D=29.7_C=0.81]  There is also $153.7 million for stage 2, including expanding the emergency department and delivering a new Northern Mental Health Precinct. There is $18.2 million to deliver a dedicated northern hospice, or Launceston Hospice Respite Care Facility, located in the Launceston General Hospital precinct, with work progressing well and on track for completion by late 2026.

There is $2 million to establish a new health and medical research centre within the new Northern Integrated Care Service building at the [Bookmark: Phr3_O=59.4_D=22.1_C=0.75]  Launceston General Hospital; $88 million for the new Northern Heart Centre, with a development application now submitted to the City of Launceston; and $8.8 million for the King's Meadows Community Centre redevelopment. There is also a $3.2-million investment to deliver stage 2 of the Midlands Multipurpose Health Centre upgrade in Oatlands, the heart of Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=83.3_D=19.2_C=0.86] In the north-west and west coast, there is nearly $80 million, including nearly $57 million at the Northwest Regional Hospital. This includes $40 million for the new mental health precinct, commencing soon, and $16.9 million for the North West Regional Hospital upgrade to expand the emergency department and ambulance drop off area [Bookmark: Phr5_O=103.0_D=14.2_C=0.80] . In addition, there is $2.94 million for a new acute care facility. 

At the Mersey Community Hospital there is $7 million to complete the redevelopment, and also in the Devonport area, there is $7.6 million for the Devonport Mental Health Hub. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=118.1_D=19.9_C=0.87]  On the west coast, there is $5.5 million for upgrades and expansion of the West Coast District Hospital Redevelopment, stage 2.

The evidence could not be clearer. We are investing significantly in our hospitals and health centres right around our state to ensure that our patients and staff have access to the world class health infrastructure that they deserve.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=138.8_D=25.2_C=0.78] I would also like to speak about Ambulance Tasmania, a service that quite literally saves lives every single day. The 2025-26 Budget allocates $16 million over the forward Estimates towards upgrades and the construction of new ambulance station infrastructure. Works to deliver Longford and Bicheno ambulance stations are well underway, and, pleasingly, plans are progressing well to deliver our four new stations at Legana, King Island, Snug and Cygnet [Bookmark: Phr8_O=164.9_D=8.3_C=0.80]  as per our election commitment. We know that our investment into these new stations will help Tasmanians to get the care they need and the help they need when they need it [Bookmark: Phr9_O=173.7_D=3.0_C=0.81] , whilst also supporting our growing paramedic workforce.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=178.2_D=26.2_C=0.88] We also continue to invest in new ambulances with more modern and fully equipped vehicles scheduled to be delivered in 2025-26 and 2026-27, giving our paramedics and volunteers the tools that they need to respond swiftly and confidently when every second counts. We are also in the process of delivering 90 new automated external defibrillators around Tasmania through the Community Defibrillator Fund, with applications for a further 90 opening in the second half of this year. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=205.3_D=8.2_C=0.78]  These 180 defibrillators are building on the 360 defibrillators we have already provided to community organisations across the state [Bookmark: Phr12_O=214.3_D=26.9_C=0.87] , empowering local communities with this life-saving equipment and strengthening the chain of survival.

In addition to the $3.22 million of ongoing funding for diagnostic breast screening provided in the 2024-25 Budget, this Budget provides an extra $7.5 million funding over three years for additional diagnostic breast imaging clinics to provide statewide public mammography services, improving accessibility and decreasing waiting times. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=241.8_D=4.4_C=0.82]  This is a significant and deeply welcome investment in Women's Health across Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=248.6_D=29.4_C=0.84] I want to speak more about our digital health transformation strategy, which is making a real difference in delivering better patient outcomes. Let me make this absolutely clear. There have been no cuts. In fact, if Labor had bothered to read the budget papers, they would have seen we have brought forward $7.2 million in funding, meaning we  have spent that money sooner on digital health transformation this financial year. 

I would like to table [Bookmark: Phr15_O=278.6_D=26.4_C=0.88]  page 113 of Budget Paper 2, Volume 1, which quite clearly states, under Digital Health Transformation, that the 2024-25 Budget was $30 million. However, the estimated outcome for 2024-25 is $37,200,000, which means that the $7,200,000 has been brought forward from years 2025-26, 2026-27, 2027-28, and then we have put an extra $30 million in the Budget this year.

Labor are claiming that we cut $7.2 million, even though the Budget confirms that we have already spent it. This is a very serious blunder from the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow treasurer, so we call on them to correct the record. How can they claim to be an alternative government - in fact, how can they claim to be an alternative treasurer - if they cannot even understand one line that is very well detailed in the budget paper? 

If that is just one error they have made, imagine how many errors they would make if they had their hands on all of the books. I can assure the House that it is this government which is implementing a whopping 10-year, $476 million Digital Health Transformation Strategy, ensuring that Tasmania's health system is transformed into a world-class, innovative and integrated system.

Under this strategy we have already delivered the patient alerts management solution, which ensures that medical professionals can access up-to-date medical records, including medications, existing conditions and allergies, while also enabling them to enter and update patient alerts electronically and in real time. This means our health workers can spend more time caring for patients and less time on administrative tasks like paperwork.
We have also delivered our nation leading e-referral system, which is available for 262 acute and community-based clinics. Replacing the outdated handwritten paper and fax-based system, e-referrals instantly logs the referral with the specialist service or clinic and notifies GPs of receipt, ensuring patients get care sooner and spend less time on waiting lists. Other initiatives include free public wi-fi across our public hospitals and at 65 regional sites across the state, including on King and Flinders islands. 

Projects in the pipeline that will be delivered soon include the implementation of the electronic medical record, known as the EMR, and an ambulance electronic patient care record, which will hold patient information accessible by healthcare staff in helping to provide the best possible health care while protecting patients and staff.

In regard to Aboriginal affairs, this Budget affirms that the voices, cultures, histories and futures of Tasmania's Aboriginal people matter, not just in words but in actions, investment and shared decision-making. This Budget is a significant step forward in our journey towards truth, healing and justice. It marks a deepening of our commitment under the National Agreement on Closing the Gap, a commitment not just signed by governments but shaped with and alongside our Coalition of Peaks partner, the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre.

The Budget provides $880,000 over the next two years to establish Tasmania's first Aboriginal truth telling and healing commissioners, to begin a Tasmanian Aboriginal-led journey towards truth telling, healing and relationship-building with Tasmanian Aboriginal people and the broader Tasmanian community. This is a first for Tasmania, a moment of deep significance for Tasmanian Aboriginal people and one that reflects our commitment to listen, learn and to act. It is a critical and necessary step towards recognising past injustices, gaining a greater understanding of the contemporary challenges being faced by Tasmanian Aboriginal people, and making real progress in healing the wounds of the past.

We will now work with Tasmanian Aboriginal people on the next steps, including the process to appoint the commissioners, noting that this will be led and driven by Tasmanian Aboriginal people. For the first time, this Budget also provides security funding across the forward Estimates for Aboriginal community controlled organisations, giving them the certainty they need to carry out the critical work. More than $1 million over four years has been allocated to support the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre (TAC), our Coalition of Peaks partner in Tasmania.

This will allow the TAC to participate fully in shared decision-making and to champion the social and economic participation of Aboriginal people, organisations and businesses across Tasmania. We are also supporting the Tasmanian Regional Aboriginal Communities Alliance (TRACA) as a collective voice for many Aboriginal community controlled organisations across the state. While TRACA has received support in the past, for the first time, this Budget provides ongoing security with $600 000 invested over four years.

We know that reconciliation is not a destination, it is a relationship, one that requires investment, intention and inclusion and that is why Reconciliation Tasmania will receive $400 000 over four years to support reconciliation activities, community engagement and their vital advocacy work, particularly in supporting the broader efforts to close the gap.

Economic empowerment is also fundamental to closing the gap, and to that end we are proud to be supporting the Palawa Business Hub with $800,000 over four years to back their outstanding success in supporting and assisting new and existing Aboriginal small businesses and entrepreneurs. 

To further support Aboriginal organisations, elders and community members to build capacity and to take part in this healing process, we are providing $640,000 over four years in capacity building funds. Whether it be supporting the Elders Council to gather stories or enabling organisations to help community members to come forward, this funding ensures that those who wish to participate can do so in culturally safe, supported and informed ways.

Chair of the oldest council, Delia Summers said:

This is for elders past and present, for families to speak their truths and most of all for young people putting our people on a healing path. 

We recognise that land and identity are linked intimately, and this is why we have increased funding for the Aboriginal Land Council of Tasmania with an additional $150,000 annually to support their important work. From going on country with ALCT and TAC earlier this year, I know how vitally important this funding is to enable them to continue their very important work.

Finally, we also recognise that appropriate development which respects and protects Aboriginal cultural heritage is of the utmost importance. This is why this Budget includes an additional $1.6 million over four years to ensure Aboriginal heritage is not only protected but respected, as well as to accelerate cultural heritage assessments so that developers have a clear understanding of potential Aboriginal heritage impacts before they commence any works.

We believe that economic development and cultural dignity can and must coexist. These investments total more than $6.6 million across the forward Estimates, but they represent something far greater than figures on a page. They represent a government that is listening, a government that is learning, and a government that is walking - not ahead, not behind, but beside Aboriginal people in Tasmania. This Budget helps to build a future in which truth is told, justice is pursued, culture is celebrated, and partnerships are real.
I want to say how much I value the outstanding stakeholders in my Aboriginal Affairs portfolio as well as the outstanding staff that I will have the honour of working alongside in both Aboriginal Heritage Tasmania as well as the Department of Premier and Cabinet.

I would like to echo that in Veterans' Affairs too, because in Veterans' Affairs the Budget strongly reaffirms our commitment to supporting our veteran community. This Budget delivers a significant increase in funding for Veterans' Affairs from $623,000 in 2024-25 to $1.198 million in 2025-26, which is a 92 per cent increase. That appropriately recognises the importance of supporting our veterans and their wellbeing. As part of this funding, we are continuing to support the Teddy Sheean VC Memorial Grants Program. We are also very committed to supporting veterans' health and wellbeing through our Veteran Wellbeing Voucher Program, which offers veterans a $200 savings on gym or sports club membership. We are also working to increase eligibility to widows and partners who will be able to apply online or present to Service Tasmania for their in-person application process for two program vouchers from 1 July. We will continue to support the Frank MacDonald Prize and RSL Tasmania, and we have funding in the Budget to assist us to deliver our current Tasmanian Veterans Employment Strategy, as well us funding to support the Commonwealth's implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide.

[6.37 p.m.]
Mr FARRELL (Lyons) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak in response to the Budget. I am a very proud Tasmanian. I am proud of our people, our ingenuity and our boundless potential. I am extremely enthusiastic about what Tasmanians can achieve. In my career I have helped many Tasmanians who are changing the world from this little island at the bottom of the earth. I have made it my mission here in this place to build a future Tasmania where no child's wings can be clipped by their post code, their bank balance or their government.

I am not relentlessly negative as those opposite might want you to believe. In fact, those who know me would probably say I am relentlessly positive.

I entered this House barely three months ago, and in that short time I have watched the Liberal minority government careen from crisis to crisis, continually announcing fresh spending sprees to paper over the wreckage of 11 years of mismanagement.

Last week we listened as the Treasurer outlined this government's financial plans for the next year. Everyone knew this was going to be a tough budget. The previous treasurer delivered increasing deficits, surging Tasmania into record debt. Each year they blow their budget and come cap in hand to parliament for additional funds to keep the state operating.

There was some hope that a new treasurer might bring fresh discipline, but that hope was misplaced. Instead, we get record deficit after record deficit, a completely fictional pathway to surplus that does not even show a single dollar being paid off the increasing debt, and a ransom note: the only escape, they say, is to sell off the services Tasmanians rely on. This was met with applause. Applause. Some of you even gave a standing ovation. I am not the only member of this Chamber who had a look of bewilderment, disgust and cringe about the cheer from the Liberal benches. It was easy to imagine the Premier and Treasurer clinking glasses and lighting cigars in celebration - Mathias Cormann and Joe Hockey-style - over a disaster that should bring shame, not cheer.
This Budget does not deserve applause. It should have been delivered in a sombre and subdued fashion, reflecting the shame of the people bringing it to this House and to this state - but, no, you are proud of it. It is not just the Treasurer and the Premier. While they are the architects of this disaster, each of you, every single one, is responsible for letting this happen.

If you allow this to happen, allow this government to continue, then you have to go home at the end of each week and find a way to hold your head high, find a way to believe that you have done something good for your community. You have to be able to look into the mirror and be comfortable that this is what you ran for parliament to achieve.

If you cannot do that, then get some courage, cross the floor and withdraw your confidence in your Premier. If you are actually here to do what is best for Tasmania, that is what you will do.

The Premier claims the Budget has been well received. This morning he said, 'business and industry recognised the positive impact our budget has had on the economy'. Let us have a read of what they really said. The TCCI - who can never trust this government again - proclaimed that the business community is sounding the alarm:

There is a massive looming budget blackhole and we can’t let the State's finances get sucked into it.

It's clear that the Government needs to rein in spending in a sensible and focused way. 

The State simply cannot go on living beyond its means and the Government is going to have to show some courage to get the budget back under control.

For many years there has been a problem in managing costs within Government, it is not so much a revenue problem as it is a problem with managing expenses.

In recent years, the final budget result each financial year has proven to be much worse than the budget estimate. At the very least, the Tasmanian Government needs to at least stick to its budget and ensure it shows the fiscal discipline to make sure the final result is not worse than the already significant deficit forecast …

Every Tasmanian should now be very concerned at the level of deficit and forecast public debt. The Government is maxing out the credit card and it will be the next generation having to pay the bill; is this the legacy that we want to leave? 

That is from the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

From TasCOSS:

… this Budget spends more than $2 billion on servicing government debt. This is money that could have been used to build 5,000 social and affordable homes, thereby providing housing for everybody on the social housing waitlist or providing energy efficiency upgrades for every household in Tasmania that needs it, permanently slashing energy costs. We are concerned the government has lost sight of what matters most to Tasmanians, with significant financial capital consumed by cost-blowouts and planning mistakes that could have been avoided.

From TasICT, the tech sector peak body:

Unfortunately, the success of reinstating a Minister for Innovation, Science, and the Digital Economy has not been followed through with a clear funding direction. It is still a portfolio without a plan and without programs. There is still no strategy for growing Tasmania's digital industry or creating the tech jobs of the future.

Indeed, what is the point of this, minister?

From TasFarmers:

Programs that were repeatedly identified as priorities for regional resilience and agricultural growth remained unspent and promises to deliver remain unmet.

Our priorities covered education, livestock welfare and the need to support positive environmental and sustainability outcomes for landowners, yet the budget did not contain any clear initiatives from prior commitments or address current industry issues.

One area we have been scrutinising closely is the promised support for an education and mentorship program for the next generation of agricultural leaders. It has been left out again. The government needs to explain why it continues to ignore such a critical pipeline.

I do not know where the support is that the government and the Premier are talking about.

This Budget is a terrible attempt at political survival. The Liberals have clearly given up. They have given up trying to manage the budget responsibly. They have given up trying to improve healthcare, education, housing and transport. There is no real path to surplus, only a fanciful yellow brick road that actually leads to fiscal oblivion.

On that yellow brick road, we have a Treasurer with no brain, a Premier with no heart and a government with no courage. Too scared to confront its own waste. Too comfortable to lead reform. Satisfied to barely limp through each week.

This rabble on the government benches have hitched their cart to selling off our future. They have thrown their hands in the air, given up trying to manage their out-of-control wasteful spending and declared that the only way out of this mess is to sell off what Tasmanians own. To sell Metro, which will lead to higher prices for bus tickets. To sell TasNetworks, which will lead to more expensive power bills. To sell Momentum Energy, which delivers millions in profit to Hydro, that will also lead to higher power bills. To sell the MAIB, which will lead to more expensive car registration, and to sell our ports, which will lead to higher costs for our producers and higher prices for everything we import.

The Premier wants you to think that he is not raising taxes, but whether you drive or catch the bus, your costs are going up. Your power bills will go up. Your cost of living will go up. Businesses will pay more, too. He may not call it tax, but for Tasmanians, it sure will feel like it. When Tasmanians are struggling, this Premier is determined to make them pay for his mistakes. This government is no friend to business, no friend to industry and no friend to Tasmania.

For the next generation, every government will have to deal with the selfish decision-making, endless project stuff ups and vacuous agenda of Premier Jeremy Rockliff. In just over three years, he has created a monument to his omni-shambolic term as Premier that could well take so long to resolve that the children of the youngest members of this parliament will be retired before it happens.

I wish this was hyperbole. I wish it was exaggeration. I deeply wish it was not actually a realistic projection of what will come if this government is allowed to continue. The only hyperbole and exaggeration is within the forward Estimates, which grossly underestimate the expenditure this government will undertake. They seem comfortable to continually misrepresent not just the forward Estimates but the planned expenditure for the next 12 months.

It is pathetic for them to call for an alternative budget when even with all the resources of government, all the support of Treasury, they have not provided a budget worth the paper it is written on for years.

This year, they came begging for over $450 million of additional cash because they blew the budget. A year before, hundreds of millions of dollars more. A year before that, hundreds of millions more. A year before that, hundreds of millions of dollars more. For six of the past seven years, the Liberal budget has been no more reliable an indication of this government's intentions than the glossy brochures they pretend are a plan for Tasmania. If they had a good plan, we would not be in this mess. If they had an iota of strategic talent in their team, we would not be in this mess.

God forbid, if this government lasts the forward Estimates, they will deliver 15 budgets with 11 deficits. The only long-term plans this government has been hoping that everyone will forget their forward Estimates. Let us not forget that in 2019 the government predicted four surpluses in a row and delivered none. In 2020, they said they would get back to surplus by 2023. In 2021, they said it would be 2024. In 2023, they said it would be 2026. This year, the Premier cannot even tell us when they be able to start paying down this debt. What does that say? They are not even prepared to spin us a story with a fictional future date because they know that under their woeful management, it will never happen. Tasmania deserves better. Tasmania deserves change.

The Labor team does have a plan. We have identified half a billion dollars in savings, a plan that will make an impact from day one, a responsible approach to reduce the deficit, but this mess is going to take a long time to unwind. What you can be absolutely sure of is that the Liberals will just continue to make things worse. They have got runs on the board, deficit after deficit, blowout after blowout, stuff-up after stuff-up. They are building their legacy, a legacy of debt that will take a generation to pay off.

This government needs to be stopped, and they need to be stopped now. Crossed fingers, crooked deals and the crossbench are all that is holding this government together. The Premier is not leading a government. He is barely babysitting a brawl. He is preaching stability while continually checking the exits.

There is a way forward. Support our no-confidence motion. Show Tasmanians that you are in their corner, not Premier Rockliff's.

[6.51 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I rise to support this Budget and in so doing congratulate the Treasurer Barnett on his first budget. I can speak with experience. It is a huge amount of work that the Treasurer has done with his team in preparing this Budget, through all of the challenges that the previous member - the member who has just resumed his seat - that he danced around but did not actually intelligently deal with in explaining how Labor would manage those same challenges differently or better.
It is a budget that does set up Tasmania. It addresses the challenges and the opportunities, and it is a better Tasmania now and into the future. That is the central theme of it - building a better Tasmania - is that not what we all want and is that not what all of our electorates and constituents expect of us to behave in this Chamber?

I could not help but notice in the Leader of the Opposition's reply - it was of course the day for the alternative budget, but we did not get one - we just got threats, threats of the crossbench and threats for chaos and destabilisation in this Chamber. That is what we have seen today from the Labor party. I could not have thought of a cleverer way to hide the fact that the Leader of the Opposition does not have an alternative budget on the day he is expected to produce  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=17.9_D=2.2_C=0.88] one than to post a motion in the box that says, 'I might or I might not move a motion of no-confidence in the Premier. Let us see if the crossbench' - that is the strangest tactic I have ever seen from a leader of the opposition. The fact is that when you would commit yourself to motion like that, you are more or less honour-bound to immediately move it [Bookmark: Phr4_O=46.0_D=29.0_C=0.83] , but he said, 'Oh no, no, I will just wait and see, I will sniff the wind and see what the crossbench are doing': a very strange way to behave and no demonstration of leadership. However, it is a demonstration of the need for a big distraction from the fact that there is no alternative budget. 

This Budget, the real budget that is in front of us, is about strengthening our economy. I will speak briefly on how strong our economy is through extraordinarily challenging times in the last six years. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=75.2_D=28.2_C=0.88]  It supports our families, our communities and our children. I will speak about literacy today and the importance of how the Budget responds to that particular challenge in an incredible way. It delivers critical services. One of the things I did not hear from the member who has just resumed his seat, when he criticises the government for coming to parliament and seeking more support for more funds, is the purposes [Bookmark: Phr6_O=104.4_D=2.8_C=0.71]  those funds have gone to, no mention of it. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=109.0_D=18.7_C=0.65]  Just that cheap shot - begging, I think 'cap in hand' was the term used, because they have blown the budget. Blown the budget? One of the reasons the budget was under pressure under the last bill that was brought before this House, I think under the Treasurer Barnett, was about extra health spending [Bookmark: Phr8_O=130.5_D=1.2_C=0.32] .

A member - I thought it was a really good address.
Mr FERGUSON -  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=133.7_D=10.6_C=0.77] Thank you for your comment. No reference to the civil litigation claims of abuse in care - going back for my entire lifetime [Bookmark: Phr10_O=145.4_D=6.9_C=0.85]  - that are being addressed by these times, this generation of parliamentarians, this parliament. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=153.7_D=1.4_C=0.91]  Huge numbers. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=157.7_D=13.7_C=0.88]  No reason given for the very large budget deficit in the previous financial year, which the budget papers highlight had an extraordinary allocation - I think the figure was $640 million [Bookmark: Phr13_O=173.1_D=13.4_C=0.81]  - for assessed negative value on the budget for the likely outcome of abuse in care claims as a result of Justice's prudent work to get an actuarial analysis [Bookmark: Phr14_O=187.0_D=9.1_C=0.83]  so that this parliament could have complete up-to-date visibility of the likely value of those claims. That is what blew out that year.  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=201.2_D=1.6_C=0.78] We should all stand by [Bookmark: Phr16_O=204.8_D=3.6_C=0.75]  it. Those poor children have been robbed of their innocence over 40 years [Bookmark: Phr17_O=211.3_D=3.6_C=0.77]  and have grown up into adults who live with trauma [Bookmark: Phr18_O=217.7_D=3.8_C=0.77] . They deserve their justice, including a financial payment. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=223.3_D=0.9_C=0.92]  

To think [Bookmark: Phr20_O=224.9_D=11.4_C=0.72]  that such an important issue can be glossed over while criticising the government for a large budget blowout which is not even cash out the door. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=237.9_D=7.2_C=0.83]  It was realised as an expense in the Budget, but it is a provision for future payments [Bookmark: Phr22_O=246.8_D=7.3_C=0.83] . How do we get to such a point where important areas of challenge and public policy can be so cheap [Bookmark: Phr23_O=256.3_D=4.4_C=0.81] ened? It really upsets me to think that is where this House may have arrived at.

 [Bookmark: Phr24_O=262.5_D=7.0_C=0.83] As to the debt position, which the Treasurer and the government - of which I am a proud member [Bookmark: Phr25_O=271.6_D=1.2_C=0.87]  - the debt position [Bookmark: Phr26_O=275.0_D=1.1_C=0.89]  is not a result [Bookmark: Phr27_O=277.7_D=6.0_C=0.90]  of the kind of irresponsibility that members of the opposition would allege [Bookmark: Phr28_O=286.5_D=12.4_C=0.81] . I state from the outset, as I said when I was treasurer, the debt position does need to improve. Public finances need to see an improvement in sustainability. I believe the Treasurer takes that view. The position we are in today is a result of many important decisions, most of which have been with the complete support of this House. I point to the infrastructure program, dealing with legacy underinvestment, bringing assets up to the standard required for our growing population and then building for the future. I will give you two best examples: the Royal Hobart Hospital's new K Block and the Bridgewater Bridge, both of which I was largely responsible for, and I am very proud about that. This House made the decision to invest in those projects on the balance sheet. 

I should not have to mention the COVID pandemic or the commission of inquiry. The commission itself had a significant expense; the response to the commission of inquiry - more than $1 billion. I have already referred to the abuse-in-care liabilities being recognised - a major hit to the budget and one that any justice-loving politician should endorse. 

There is the extraordinary and growing health demand. I will call out Canberra on this point over the extraordinary withdrawal of effort from the Australian Government for our health system. It was not that long ago that the Gillard government set itself a goal for the country that we would get to 50:50 funding in health for our hospitals. Deputy Speaker, colleagues in this Chamber and people listening, let me tell you that the official deal is that it would be 45 per cent federal and 55 per cent state. Guess what it at right now? It is at or below 39 per cent now. Who is carrying the extra cost of this demand? It is this government; it is this Budget, it is our balance sheet that is wearing that extra effort. Meanwhile, in last year's budget, what did you see? You saw a state budget actually funding GP services. I believe we all know who is responsible for primary care in this country. 

We just had an election where certain people were pulling out their Medicare cards from their lapel pocket and saying, 'This is all you'll need.' Well, that is new. Why have you not been doing it? It is the state governments of this country that have been picking up the tab, even for Medicare under an Albanese Labor government. I look forward to the Albanese government keeping its promise that Labor will make doctors visits free. I look forward to that. I think it has not happened yet. Maybe it is something that will start on 1 July. I look forward to seeing that promise being honoured, but I seriously doubt it. The words I have uttered are exactly the words printed on the corflutes that were around polling booths all around this country, that 'Labor will make doctors' visits free again.' That is the promise the Labor party has made. Let us see how that goes.

The fiscal strategy is important. It is important for all of us to get behind it and support that. It is about financial and spending discipline. It is about having a strategy not for this year - that is not what it is about. It was never about this year or last year or next year. It is about the position we should be aiming for in 2032. It has always been thus; it is a 10-year strategy. I commend it to every member of this House. It was rewritten for the times that we were confronting two years ago, knowing full well that there are these challenges in the budget.

The government's position on budget management is made so much more difficult by this lazy opposition. On the one hand, it is not prepared, has not ever been prepared in the time I have been on this side of the House, to publish an alternative budget, as they should, as the Greens will probably do tomorrow. Cost it out, line by line. On the other hand, the opposition constantly demands that the government spend more money, and then criticise the government for deficit positions that we are confronted with right now. What hypocritical and useless opposition would do that? You cannot have it both ways. They ought to have the courage of their convictions to commit their promises and their utterances to an income statement and a balance sheet, to tell Tasmanians that if their policies were implemented what that would do, positive or negative, for the budget in Tasmania. They have not done it.

Did any of us expect them to do it today? I did not, but it was the day that they should have done so. To hide their nakedness, they stitched together some fig leaves called a no-confidence motion and popped it in the box. So ashamed to call themselves an opposition. I have heard it said that the real opposition is in fact to my right; the crossbench. I have heard it said more than once that the real opposition is actually not where I look over there, it is to my right.

No alternative budget. If we had seen an alternative budget, we would have had to have seen Labor's election promises being implemented as well from last year, including the extraordinary commitment - which they appear very clearly to have walked away from - and I will point this out for the Treasurer's benefit as well - because there was no mention of it in the Budget reply - for their electricity promises; that they would reduce them all for every household by $250 and then each year after that do the same. No mention of it. Now you see why there is no alternative budget, because they are not even committed to their policies.

I want to say the Treasurer did a fine job at the Budget Roadshow. The one I attended at Launceston was well attended and very well received. The Treasurer gave a very good account of himself and explained the budget challenges and opportunities. In particular, I was very pleased to see continued growth in our economy and the forecast going forward, including and especially the growth in the gross state product, the real measure of economic progress in the state; the real measure of the economy. Our unemployment rate - I hope this does not bore members of the opposition, but we will keep saying it - is 3.8 per cent. We have seen 3.8 per cent before, but actually the ABS revised past numbers. This is the lowest unemployment rate on record; 3.8 per cent. It is something the government can take credit for, but more especially, our business community in Tasmania. Despite all the national challenges, the business community of our state reports a greater level of confidence in the government's policies, business conditions and a greater level of confidence for their own prospects going forward than the rest of the country. I know these surveys come and go. I know that there is ebb and flow, but that is the position.

We deserve to be proud of it and also not to damage that optimism and confidence. I can speak from experience. I have been a member of this House for quite a long time, under a Labor-Greens government and in a Liberal government. Confidence is so hard to build. It is so easy to destroy. A government can rapidly destroy confidence, for example, when it makes alliances with jobs-destroying Greens parties.

I could speak for a long time about the cost-of-living supports in the Budget. I will not do that in view of the time. I could speak for a very long time about important health investments that will save lives and improve lives. Can I just spend a moment focusing on the surgical robot? Yes. It is not the largest expenditure item. It is $4.7 million. It is something that I worked very hard for. It is something I first learned about some years ago at an opening of a business when a consultant urologist from Launceston drew me aside and asked, 'Michael, can we speak with you about the opportunity for a surgical robot?' I feel so grateful that two years later, the funds are there for one. It will change lives. It will change the practice of medicine, not just at the LGH but in our state. I am thrilled about that. I know that the Department of Health is just about to make its final decision as to the particular model. I am thrilled about that, particularly in the first instance for men's health. The first and most pressing application for this is prostate surgeries. I want to quickly mention to the House that the robot does not do the surgery, the surgeon does, but with this very special tool. The surgeon, he or she, will be guiding the robot physically with his or her hands in the booth with good visibility of the patient, and the robot will be doing the actual cutting, the actual cauterising, the actual suture. Extraordinary. There is so much more. I will have to put it on my website instead.

Investing in schools: this is where I will finish. Not only are we moving to 100 per cent of school resource standard being met next year - you could attack us for that because we were allowed under the deal with Canberra to leave it to 2034. I guess not many people know that. Other states are leaving it longer. We are not. We are implementing it next school year, in this financial year, in this Budget coming. I am so excited, because I see one of the great challenges of our state, for all of our kids - whether you are in a government school or a non-government school - as being the poor literacy rates. The country has a problem with literacy. I think Tassie might be at the lower end of the state rankings. It might even be the last, but if you take a look at all the states, none of us are doing particularly well. More than 20 years ago, there was a major report done on how to remediate poor literacy in this country - the National Reading Inquiry. Do you know what? More than 20 years ago when it was published, every state and territory jurisdiction ignored it because it was not their ideological preference. It was not fashionable.

History has proven those bureaucrats wrong, including the Tasmanian bureaucrats who held it up. Now it is happening. We are moving to evidence-based phonics; explicit instruction. It will benefit all our kids. There are adults today who do not feel comfortable with their level of literacy. It is because they were taught under a model that worked okay for a lot of kids, but not for all. This will work for all.

This could be one of the most significant things that this government achieves. Structured, evidence-based literacy pedagogy based on phonics and explicit instruction - the science of learning. It is the most inclusive model. Guess who are the biggest winners out of this new approach? It is Aboriginal kids. It is kids from homes with low literacy. It is kids from non-English-speaking backgrounds. It is the people that we have a sense of great responsibility to do better for. That is in the Budget. It might surprise members to hear me focus on that, but as an educator, what a great investment to make. I am proud to have given voice to it. I am grateful to the education minister, Ms Palmer, for running with this, and to previous ministers for getting it started.

I commend the Budget to the House, with all of the goodness that it brings for our state both now and into the future.

Debate adjourned.


ADJOURNMENT

[7.12 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Attorney-General) - Honourable Deputy speaker, I move - 
That the House does now adjourn.


Answer to Question - Homelessness - Code Blue Protocol for Extreme Weather Events
Answer to Question - GFG Alliance - Tasmanian Jobs and Debt - Liberty Bell Bay

Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Attorney-General) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Consumer Affairs, I refer to the question asked by Mr O'Byrne this morning of the relevant minister relating to the government's requirements for code blue for homelessness services. The minister has committed to provide the House with further information as soon as possible, but no later than Thursday, prior to Adjournment.

Further, a question from the opposition leader, Dean Winter, to the honourable Eric Abetz. Does Liberty Bell Bay or any of its associated entities owe money to the Tasmanian Government? I am advised the answer is as follows. From the minister, Eric Abetz:

Liberty Bell Bay payment arrangements with Tasmanian government departments and government businesses are commercial-in-confidence. However, to the best of our knowledge, Liberty Bell Bay and its associated entities are either up to date with their obligations or operating within agreed payment terms. 

I thank the House.


Quit Tasmania - Budget Cuts

[7.13 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Deputy Speaker,  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=24.8_D=1.0_C=0.96]  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=27.6_D=28.7_C=0.83] I rise to speak about the appalling decision by this government of 50 per cent funding cut in this year's budget to essential anti-tobacco campaigns to preventative health organisation Quit Tasmania. I am sure the irony is not lost on anyone that last Saturday was World No Tobacco Day, an important milestone to celebrate all that has been achieved towards smoking reduction and particularly we will concentrate on Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=57.2_D=4.4_C=0.84] I acknowledge the amazing work Quit Tasmania, Public Health [Bookmark: Phr5_O=63.5_D=20.8_C=0.86]  officials, general practitioners, local governments and so forth have achieved in this space. In 2001, 23.7 per cent of Tasmanians smoked. Compare that to 14.6 per cent in 2022 and 2023. That is a 9.1 per cent drop over those 12 years. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=85.9_D=27.0_C=0.84]  This has been no accident, but the concerted effort of health organisations, governments, Australia's world-leading public health campaigns, education strategies and more. 

Tasmanians from all backgrounds have pulled together with the goal to stamp out smoking in our community, which is why it was so disappointing to hear that the Liberal government has cut Quit Tasmania's funding for their anti-tobacco campaigns [Bookmark: Phr7_O=114.2_D=3.2_C=0.65]  in half, effective from the 30 June. Unfortunately, that figure is waning. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=130.9_D=29.2_C=0.86]  The national scorecard of ACOSH, the Australian Council on Smoking and Health, which has awarded Tasmania a B this year for progress on tobacco and vaping and I quote -

The Tasmanian government is showing progress by updating state legislation. However, their funding, commitment to public education and campaigns needs to be lifted and maintained at evidence-based levels.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=163.1_D=24.6_C=0.85] Despite all that has been achieved, the fight against smoking is far from over. Thirteen per cent of Tasmanians still smoke, which is an estimated 60,000 people who spend over a billion dollars per year on this addictive curse that is tobacco. Two in three people die from a tobacco related illness, an estimated 500 Tasmanians per year. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=188.6_D=5.6_C=0.74]  Our illegal tobacco and vaping problem continues to spiral out of control with governments [Bookmark: Phr14_O=194.5_D=2.8_C=0.92]  and law-enforcement officials struggling to keep up [Bookmark: Phr15_O=198.2_D=12.6_C=0.90] , and sadly, we have a vaping crisis on our hands. One in five young people now vape, which makes young people who do not smoke five times more likely to take up the addictive habit of smoking.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=212.3_D=20.7_C=0.86] The time to take action on rates of smoking is now. This is not an issue we have stamped out for good, but one that requires ongoing action and clever campaigns. Quit Tasmania is Tasmania's leading voice when it comes to smoking prevention. Not only do they offer individual counselling and support to help Tasmanians quit [Bookmark: Phr17_O=233.9_D=22.3_C=0.86] , they provide essential public information campaigns that encourage people to not take up smoking in the first place. Evidence consistently shows that the best way to stop smoking is to cut it back at the roots. This is the best bang for your buck solution that not only promotes better health but saves the government money in the long run.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=257.5_D=3.1_C=0.90] Perhaps what is strange about the government's announcement [Bookmark: Phr19_O=261.6_D=17.7_C=0.83]  is the fact that it has coincided with the government's own plans to release their 20-year preventative health strategy. It also coincides with the government's Tasmanian Cancer Plan. Surely the government knows that smoking is a leading cause of 16 cancers. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=280.3_D=24.7_C=0.82]  Frontline organisations like Quit Tasmania should be properly funded to undertake their essential work. 

I finish with two key questions of the Liberals, and the Greens believe it is something that the public has a right to know. Has anyone in your Cabinet been lobbied to weaken regulations regarding the sale of smoke and products? Does this influence how you decide to fund projects which curb tobacco use?

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=16.2_D=15.6_C=0.80] Mr SHELTON (Lyons) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the 187th Campbell Town Show, held last week at the Campbell Town Showgrounds in the beautiful Midlands. Attending the Campbell Town Show has been a long-standing tradition within farming and agricultural families [Bookmark: Phr4_O=33.8_D=13.2_C=0.78]  Tasmania-wide. The current show program is run over two days and includes the displays, competitions, food and entertainment, making it a draw card for a day of family fun [Bookmark: Phr5_O=47.4_D=4.0_C=0.93]  and for some, friendly rivalry between farming families.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=52.3_D=8.6_C=0.62] Commercial sheep competitions, sheepdog trials, junior sheep judging, shearing exhibitions, trade exhibitions [Bookmark: Phr7_O=63.4_D=11.4_C=0.86] , equine events, show jumping and children's entertainment are all part of the show, which still maintains its popularity through many generations of farming [Bookmark: Phr8_O=75.9_D=1.2_C=0.90]  and agriculture.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=78.1_D=25.1_C=0.85] This year also saw the Rural Youth Beaut Ute Competition added to the many attractions. Utes and four-wheel-drives were cleaned, polished and lined up for a car display showcasing the best of the best in the area. Bull bars and spotlights, stickers and aerials were all on display. The bigger the better, in some cases. It was great to see the youth [Bookmark: Phr10_O=103.8_D=8.0_C=0.68]  of Tasmania showing the pride and joy they have for their vehicles in the country line-up.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=112.9_D=15.6_C=0.80] A huge attraction to the show for district schools is the Tasmanian Wool Centre Prize and students work hard throughout the year to earn the coveted award.

I must mention that this year [Bookmark: Phr12_O=130.3_D=13.7_C=0.81]  gave me a proud grandfather moment. My grandson, Chase, who attends the Cressy District High School, entered the sheep handling competition this year, with his other colleagues from the school [Bookmark: Phr13_O=144.8_D=26.2_C=0.84]  for the first time, showing one of the school's Suffolk sheep. Although they were a relatively new team with only one week's experience behind them, Chase worked hard to refine his craft and was awarded with a first prize ribbon. His love of trying new things [Bookmark: Phr14_O=171.1_D=7.0_C=0.59]  is certainly paying off, and as his pop, I am very proud of his determination and drive.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=178.8_D=19.9_C=0.87] This year's Show Committee President, Annie Thompson, and the Executive Committee have volunteered many hours of work to ensure the successful planning of the show, allowing the seamless running of the two-day event. Congratulations to Annie and her team of dedicated volunteers for another great show this year. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=200.6_D=8.1_C=0.83]  The show would also not be a success without the huge efforts of volunteer organisations such as Rural Youth, SES [Bookmark: Phr17_O=210.0_D=27.4_C=0.80] , Rural Alive and Well, and the Campbell Town Fire Brigade and sponsors, just to name a few.

The show injects much needed spending into the local economy with exhibitors, patrons and competitors coming from far and wide to attend both days of the show. This means local accommodation, and there is evident benefit from that attendance; shops and local businesses benefit from the extra spend in the area by the tourists  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=238.4_D=1.3_C=0.47] who attend and the like.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=240.6_D=25.3_C=0.77] Again, this year's Show Society hosted by the AWI Sports Shearing and Wool Handling Competition saw the state final. Coordinated by Max Flood of AWI, the competition raises the profile and the status of the shearing industry through local and regional level competitions and skill development.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=267.0_D=28.4_C=0.82] Competition such as these promote excellence and professionalism within Australia's shearing industry and encourages young people to join the industry. I congratulate all the winners of the Sports Shearing Competition and look forward to seeing where your skills and expertise take you in the future.

I again congratulate Annie and the Midlands Agricultural Association on another successful Campbell Town Show. It is great to see how a country show can unite the community and look forward to attending again next year to see everything the show offers.


Tasmania Police - Roster Arrangements

[7.23 p.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I rise to share with the House on the Adjournment tonight some statements provided to me by some of our hardworking Tasmanian police officers in relation to the rostering system. They provide evidence to their support of the wellbeing roster system, as opposed to the antiquated Ottawa system which they are being forced to return to due to budget cuts. I appreciate the faith and trust Tasmania Police officers are putting to us here because it takes a lot for police officers to show their vulnerabilities and express what the rostering means to them on a personal level. I believe it is important that, as decision-makers and lawmakers, we are prepared to listen to the people we send out to deal with the hardest things in our community. We need to be prepared to fund the wellbeing rosters. 

This is told from the perspective of a career police officer: 

For much of this year, my partner has been working interstate. Under the four-by-four roster, we were able to still coordinate spending time together, either at home or interstate. Under the new Ottawa roster, it has been extremely difficult to spend any time together, resulting in us often going weeks or months without being able to spend any amount of time together.

The shift structure and lack of overlaps in the Ottawa system is simply not suited to high-tempo modern policing activities. Members are almost always required to work continuation of duty over time. This is due to having to attend response jobs shortly before changeover or due to having to complete reports they were unable to do during shift due to the volume of response work. Shifts regularly extend beyond the rostered hours and the only certainty has been that you likely won't finish on time.

Despite working shorter shifts, it is becoming impossible to plan activities after work. I find with the overtime and volume of work we are required to do, two days is simply not enough time to decompress or reset. I'm far more fatigued and stressed under the Ottawa roster than I was working an alternate roster.

During a one-month survey period of the Ottawa roster, I calculated I was required to work in excess of 30 hours overtime. Under other rosters, much of the overtime being undertaken was voluntary and members had a much greater ability to self-manage. 
The working pattern under Ottawa is physically and mentally draining. This has led me to seek support from a psychologist who, in one session, described the rostering environment as a 'burnout factory'.

That is pretty compelling.

This is told from the perspective of an early-career constable:

I graduated as a constable within the last two years. I worked the four on and four off roster for approximately five months. This included the outstations component I did as a trainee. I loved this roster.

Being a new constable is one of the most overwhelming jobs I've ever had. We are taught from a young age to crawl, walk, run. Being a police constable, you start by running and are sometimes requested to fly. The cognitive strain this puts on you is enormous. As well as responding to critical incidents, I found the run of four days off allowed me to reset and deal with what I had just experienced. The incidents included suicides, family violence matters, sudden deaths and dangerous arrests. 

My wife informed me that I was so much happier in this new career and she enjoyed having me home for the sustained period. This all changed when Ottawa came in. We started with training days, then a round of four afternoon shifts. Afternoon shifts are always busy and everyone was exhausted. We are meant to finish at 12 pm, but that rarely happens due to catching up on paperwork. You get home, go to bed, then wake up late in the morning. Your two days off turns into one-and-a-half. 

My wife and I had our first daughter in 2024. This is when I really noticed a decline in my love for the job and mental health. I found I was never home, and when I was, I couldn't switch off. The two days off in a row isn't enough to rest.

When I worked the run of seven nights, my wife really struggles as she feels she needs to leave the house for a week so I can sleep. Then I am left with the guilt of knowing I can't support her.

I knew joining the job I would need to do shiftwork but the four on, four off roster made it worthwhile. The support is not there and the workforce feels it strongly.

Thank you.


Windsor Park - Opening

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=16.2_D=28.8_C=0.81] [7.28 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak about the opening of the newly redeveloped Windsor Oval. On Saturday I had the pleasure of attending the opening of the oval at Windsor Park by Christina Holmdahl, along with Launceston Football Club president Scott Stephens and AFL Tasmania state participation and programs manager Aaron Roberts. 

Windsor Oval was first constructed in 1968 and has been home for the Launceston Football Club for the last 50 years [Bookmark: Phr3_O=45.2_D=30.0_C=0.87] , noting that the Launceston Football Club has been in existence for 150 years, which is evidence that football has been strong in Tasmania's history for a very long time. 

The Windsor Oval has undergone a $2 million redevelopment over the last few months that sees both a new surface and lighting upgrades. The works conducted include a re-levelling of the oval surface, new drainage systems [Bookmark: Phr4_O=75.3_D=30.0_C=0.82]  installed, sand slitting irrigation, the establishment of a 100-millimetre sand mattress, reseeding as well as new perimeter fencing and improved lighting. I had the opportunity to speak to one of the contractors for the works and they stepped me through some of what was involved, and it is quite impressive. 

At the opening, I had the opportunity to see the outcome of all that work up close as we stood on the grass for the ceremony. I am no expert but the surface was a sight to behold and it is now likely the second best football [Bookmark: Phr5_O=105.4_D=30.0_C=0.80] -playing surface after the York Park stadium surface, or so I am told. I know that is a tough call to make because as well as York Park, Legana Oval was opened recently and provides another excellent oval with a great playing surface. Regardless of which playing surface really is the best, we are spoilt for choice in playing fields in Bass and that is how it should be. Everyone should have access to quality sporting facilities where they live. As Mayor Holmdahl said in her opening address:

It is well known [Bookmark: Phr6_O=135.5_D=8.2_C=0.80]  that the benefits of sport are endless by creating healthier communities, building resilience, strength and cooperation.
 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=144.2_D=29.6_C=0.87] 
We are making progress on sporting facilities and, as I have said, Bass has a number of great facilities that have been upgraded recently. However, there remain communities with minimal or poor-quality grounds and courts. We know that different football codes and other sports do not have access to the same great facilities, making it difficult for people to engage in sport at the level they may want to. We know that people do want to participate in sport. On Saturday it was great to see so many people on the oval with their teams [Bookmark: Phr8_O=174.0_D=28.1_C=0.83]  all across the age groups and the genders. 

I could not help but draw the parallel and think about the fuss being made about the Macquarie Point stadium and the wonders it will supposedly do for sport participation. However, let us not pretend that a stadium at Macquarie Point will suddenly have everyone playing local sport. It is local facilities that will have everyone playing local sport. 

Standing in front of me on Saturday was the real heart of sport, the real arena for sporting engagement and participation. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=202.4_D=29.7_C=0.85]  People from Launceston and the West Tamar were able to go along to their local sporting field and get involved in their local club. They did not need a billion-dollar stadium at the other end of the state. They did not need to travel a long distance to watch other people play sport while they sat in the stands. That is if they could even afford to travel and get a ticket. No, these people showed up at their local playing field to play with their local team, and this story is played out right across the state: local communities getting fit together, participating, connecting with [Bookmark: Phr10_O=232.3_D=29.9_C=0.83]  others and enjoying the health and social benefits of playing sport in a group. 
This government can go on and on about how wonderful the stadium will be for the state and what it will do for the future, but it does not stack up. The stadium will cost at least $1 billion, it will put us into $2 billion of debt, it will suck resources out of services that Tasmanians need and the so-called benefits of increased participation can be achieved without it. We certainly do not need the stadium to do those things. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=262.4_D=27.8_C=0.82]  They are already happening. We know that. I saw it with my own eyes on Saturday. 

Congratulations to West Tamar Council on the opening of Windsor Oval. Congratulations to Launceston Football Club on a significant win on Saturday. May we as a state be honest about what we need, reject this expensive, unnecessary stadium and instead invest in community sport and community facilities that actually do make a difference to people's health and wellbeing.



Australian Masters Rowing Championships

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=291.0_D=1.0_C=0.60] [7.32 p.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Honourable  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=293.9_D=11.0_C=0.78] Deputy Speaker, speaking about health and well-being, last week, as some of you probably know, I was at the Australian Masters Rowing Championships which were held at Penrith, which is the 2000 Olympic course. I did okay. I came home with some bling, so I am very happy about that. I last represented Tasmania way back in 2003, so I was very pleased to actually pick up a bronze medal for Tasmania in the 8. There is an interstate race and I raced that competitively, and we got bronze. I think we won the bronze. We did not really lose the silver, we won the bronze. I think it really sets up the state for future Masters regattas.

For the record, I have been rowing way more competitively this year, and then the idea of attending the national Masters came up. Before I nominated for the Tasmanian team, I actually asked the Liberals for a pair and that was agreed to. The reason why is because I needed to know that I could nominate for the Tasmanian team and not have to withdraw later. There is nothing worse than having somebody in your crew and then at the last minute them having to withdraw. You need time to settle in and work together.

I attended and actually had a great time, and Tasmania performed very well. One of the highlights I think was the men's Masters quad scull getting silver in the interstate. That was a really close race, too. That was really good.

The number of medals that Tasmanians won was actually incredible. Considering the number of rowers that we have in the state compared to some of the bigger states, Tasmania did very well. On a per capita basis we were probably the leading state. What it said to me was if you are competitive in Tasmania, you are actually competitive nationally.

My age category was very competitive. I am a D, where the average age of your crew has to be between 50 and 54. When you think about it, when people come back to rowing when their kids are sorted and they have a bit of extra time, it tends to be the C and D category. The ages between around 45 to 55 are the most competitive events. These events were very competitive.

I would also like to point out that the local clubs in my electorate of Braddon did very well. On the medal tally, Ulverstone came 25th out of 97 clubs that won medals. When you consider there were only four people from Ulverstone who actually competed - Gina Anderson, Michael Wilson, Sandra Wilson and Jason Dolbel - coming 25th with only four athletes was actually an incredible achievement. My own club, I have been rowing at Mersey this year, and we actually came 29th. Again, we only had four people actually competing and yet we came 29th on the medal tally. That was myself, Alison Kirkwood, Simon Nowell and Greg Marshall.

All this would not have happened - I rowed the single, but I also rowed a whole bunch of crew events, so I would just like to recognise the people who I rowed with during the competition. There are also mixed events in the Masters. That is why Masters is such a good event - because you can row with women, you can row with younger and older people. It is so social and so supportive. It is just a fantastic event. The people I rowed with were Alison Kirkwood, who won the E mixed double, Pat Bird from North Esk and then a whole bunch of guys: Dion Birtwhistle, John Pitt, Dave Palmer, Tom Wilcox, Pete Gibson, Greg Marshall, Roberto Odeja, Rob Wrigley, Matthew Brown and also a special mention to Claire Gregg who was our coxswain in the interstate eight. She is just incomparable. She is amazing. She was coxing different states, different ages, different genders across the whole week. She came home with a swag of medals, and is such a great personality too. Also a special mention to Trevor Barrett from North Esk who coached us in the interstate eight. I would also like to mention Jane Hilliard, who together with Alison Kirkwood, Simon Noel, Greg Marshall and myself shared a house, and we just had a great time.

It was a fantastic event. I would really encourage people to do it because you know, rowing is such a great sport which you can do. There were athletes in their 90s still competing. There were not many of them but they were still there. What it shows is that this is a sport that you can do well into your old age. It is fantastic. You can go to higher level events; you can have a great time. You can catch up with your old friends like I did. I caught up with a whole bunch of people I used to row with. It was a fantastic event.

There were some things mentioned over the PA - that I was a politician from Tasmania - and it actually got mentioned that people were having a crack at me in the paper. That came over the announcement. Anyway, I had a great time and I think I did Tasmania proud.

Time expired.


Tasmanian Screen Industry

[7.38 p.m.]
Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for the Arts and Heritage) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I rise this evening to acknowledge the extraordinary work of the Tasmanian screen sector. Much time and coordination are involved when creating these productions, with long timelines and complex filming schedules, yet coincidentally we have two high-profile productions being released within days of each other this month.

I was invited this evening by Netflix Australia to attend a private screening of a new series of The Survivors, which airs for the public this Friday. Obviously, my commitment to parliament prevents me from being there, but I am thrilled to talk about this six-part series that was filmed in our beautiful island state. The show is based on the novel by Australian writer Jane Harper and features a cautionary tale of coastal living in Tasmania. The series showcases our expansive landscapes, with the Tasmanian peninsula as its backdrop.

The Netflix series received $500,000 in support from our government, the Tasmanian Government, through Screen Tasmania's production support program. Through this program we have been able to support not only this series, but also the 80 talented Tasmanian professionals who have poured their skills and passion into this project. A record number of Tasmanians across the full spectrum of experience and diverse backgrounds were given training and career advancement opportunities through a jointly funded $89,000 training and attachment initiative between Netflix and Screen Tasmania.

In addition, The Survivors recorded an expenditure of $8.8 million right around the state, and these are dollars going into the Tasmanian economy. We launched our $1-million Island Screen initiative program last year, which supported Alone season 3 to shoot in the state and created a pipeline of continued work for Tasmanians in the industry. Another production I would like to highlight this evening is the popular ABC series, Bay of Fires. Season 2 will premiere on ABC Australia and ABC iView on 15 June.

The show was filmed in and around Tasmania's beautiful west coast last year, led by producer, creator and star, Marta Dusseldorf, and this season received $1.7 million in funding from the Tasmanian government through Screen Tasmania. The production recorded expenditure of a jaw-dropping $1.4 million in the west coast region and $8.16 million around the state. It has employed more than 100 Tasmanian cast and crew members, along with a great many extras and service providers.

Screen Tasmania's innovative training scheme, which was utilised during production, has helped to elevate local practitioners and build greater capacity for future productions, which translates to skilled jobs for Tasmanians. With investment in the screen industry, we can see the valuable impact in our local communities and economy. These productions serve as a showcase of our local talent and the stunning landscape that we are all so fortunate to call home.

They are also a shining example of what we can achieve when we come together to tell our stories - stories that are exciting and colourful and poignant. I encourage you all to watch these shows to soak up the stunning backdrops of Tasmania and take notice of the immense talent of our people, as it will not only be you who witnesses Tasmania's greatness, it will be viewers far beyond our state and beyond our country who will experience a glimpse of what it is like to be on a remarkable island, our beloved home. It brings me great pleasure to know that we have had a hand in showcasing Tasmania to the world.

The House adjourned at 7.41 p.m.
