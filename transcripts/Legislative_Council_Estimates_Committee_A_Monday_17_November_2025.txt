The Government Budget Estimates Committee A met in the Legislative Council at 9 a.m.

CHAIR (Ms Forrest) - Welcome, Treasurer, to the budget Estimates scrutiny for your portfolio areas. We're starting off with Treasury and finance, going into finance general, and then to your responsibilities as the Minister for Macquarie Point Urban Renewal later today.

I invite you to introduce the members of your team for the purpose of Hansard, and then if you want to make a brief introductory statement - you don't? You want to go straight to questions? That'd be great. But if you could do that, that'd be really appreciated for Hansard.

Mr ABETZ - The gentlemen sitting with me have specific titles. Dean Burgess, your title is?

Mr BURGESS - Deputy Secretary, Economic and Financial Policy Division.

Mr ABETZ - Gary Swain I know is Secretary. James Craigie?

Mr CRAIGIE - Deputy Secretary, Budget and Finance Division.

CHAIR - Okay. Treasurer, you didn't want to make any comments to start?

Mr ABETZ - No. Let's get into the questions.

CHAIR - That's fine. Well, I will lead off; I'm sure other members will have questions to follow.

Treasurer, you said in your budget speech:

Our goal is simple and measurable: to reach peak debt, the point at which annual borrowings stop increasing by the end of the forward Estimates, and to begin paying debt down thereafter.

If I can take you to your cashflow statements on page 209 and 210 in Budget Paper 1, in particular, last year of the forward Estimates. I'll give you a moment to get your papers.

Mr ABETZ - Thanks, Chair. What page?

CHAIR - 209.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, 209. Here we go.

CHAIR - From my reading of your figures there, operating produces surplus cash of $322 million net purchased -

Mr ABETZ - Just bear with me. Which section are you -

CHAIR - In your cashflow statement.

Mr ABETZ - Yes. At the top? No. There are various sections of it, that's all.  There we go. Yes.

CHAIR - Yes, at the end of the forward Estimates. Toward the end of the forward Estimates.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, thank you.

CHAIR - Net purchase of non-financial assets requires $740 million in cash, and financial assets takes a further $409 million, which all means a borrowing of $735 million is required. Can you explain to me how this implies peak debt will be achieved in 2028-29?

Mr ABETZ - Well, that is what our ambition is, and that is what we're going to be working towards.

CHAIR - But you've told the people that we are reaching peak debt then. I'd like to see the modelling and the assumptions that sit behind that, when you're still paying the net borrowing cost of $734.8 million in the 2028-29 year, that's when you claim the surplus. So, can you tell me how peak debt is achieved at that point and we can start paying down debt?

Mr ABETZ - Through the initiatives that we've already announced, but more announcements will be made, as I indicated in the 2026 Budget.

CHAIR - What initiatives have you counted and what are they worth?

Mr ABETZ - We have - well, some of them haven't been exactly costed as yet, but the efficiency and productivity unit, the right -

CHAIR - How much is that unit expected to save?

Mr ABETZ - We don't have an exact figure on those things. It might save more or less than people might anticipate, so we're not putting exact figures on it.

CHAIR - In finance general, there's $150,000 a year.

Mr SWAIN - Yes. There's the existing 2023-24 BED that's now fully allocated. There was the productivity and efficiency measure which in Finance-General commences in 2027-28, which is a further $150,000. There are the election savings around communications and procurement and property, which are about $12 million in a year. In relation to the cashflows from financing activities, we have started discussing, with the Treasurer, the 2026-27 Budget repair. Those cashflows are taken into account in those discussions in relation to the 734 that's in the final year you identified already.

CHAIR - Treasurer, what modelling have you got that shows that the so-called surplus is actually achievable? What modelling have you got that shows the savings you will need to make and how you're going to achieve them to get there? It's misleading to tell the people that you will get there if you can't demonstrate to the parliament how you will do it.

Mr ABETZ - With respect, I don't agree with the terminology you employed. You can set yourself goals and ambitions and then work towards those goals without knowing the exact amounts in each particular area. What we're doing is we've set ourselves the pathway and that will require a very close analysis of all the different portfolio areas and agencies to right-size them to ensure that we can get to the aim of having a balanced budget.

CHAIR - Have you done modelling?

Mr ABETZ - No.

CHAIR - You don't have any modelling that would demonstrate that this is achievable?

Mr SWAIN - As the Treasurer has said, at this point there are discussions on what the level of ambition should be over what time frame, and the specific pathway is to be worked up in the next Budget in part in discussion with the multi-partisan budget panel.

CHAIR - So, we really have no idea how we're going to get there. What I'm hearing you say, correct me if I'm wrong, is that it seems that the Budget in May next year will reveal all, is that right?

Mr ABETZ - It will basically be revealing the detail of the pathway. We have set our goals knowing we were sent to an early election on the basis of the need for budget repair. Everybody talked about the need for budget repair. A no-confidence motion got carried on that basis to an election. Therefore, it stands to reason that the parliament would want budget repair to occur. We have set a pathway to budget repair and said, 'Right, if we are to achieve a balanced budget in the forwards, then these are the steps to get there.' Then the detail of that is being worked out as we speak.

As I indicated in the budget speech when I officially became Treasurer, no longer caretaker, on 20 August, there was the second no-confidence motion, so I could only be fully briefed by Treasury as of 20 August. The day that Cabinet locked away the budget figures was 15 September that were delivered on 6 November. The window of opportunity for me to get things together for this particular Budget was about as limited as you can get.

CHAIR - A number of the decisions you've put into this budget push out capital expenditure, particularly in the school space. I note several of them have been pushed out for a year or two years. Some call it reprofiling - call it what you like - as well as other infrastructure projects. That doesn't mean that need goes away. They've been pushed out to help this year and next year look not so bad. When we go to the policy and parameter statement and other financial reporting there, we see significant falls in dividends from the government businesses, particularly Hydro and TasNetworks. There are others - TasPorts as well - and we all know the that problems TT-Line has at the minute.

When when you look at that and then suddenly in the forward Estimates for those years, suddenly their profitability seems to turn around. On what basis have you assumed that there will be a huge uptick in dividends and income tax equivalents from our government businesses?

What's the basis, what modelling have you from them or yourselves that show there will actually be a significant uptick in the profitability of Hydro Tasmania and TasNetworks in particular? That's both demonstrated in your budget papers. I am not making it up.

Mr SWAIN - Every year we go through a corporate planning process with the businesses and provide advice on that to the Treasurer, through the Treasurer, to the portfolio minister. Hydro this year in particular had a lower result partly around hydrology but has in its corporate plan a return to more significant returns to the government anticipated through its corporate planning cycle.

TasNetworks, of course, does have a very significant project afoot, which will need to be managed carefully in the north-west transmission project as well as its normal business as usual work. But it is a regulated business with regulated WAC that should allow it to provide more returns than it did in this year -

CHAIR - Only if it passes the cost on to consumers.

Mr SWAIN - I was going to say this year was also affected by some flood events and some unusual events.

CHAIR - How can you put figures like that in your budget papers that show a significant increase in the profitability of both Hydro and TasNetworks to rely on those to prop up the budget in the out years - that you've been relying on ensuring the people of Tasmania - the ambition you are now calling it - is surplus in the out years.

Mr SWAIN - Out of the corporate planning process, there's a statement of corporate intent where performance measures, fiscal and otherwise, are agreed effectively between the board and the government and that's what's being relied on here.

CHAIR - You're relying on a corporate plan?

Mr SWAIN - The statement of corporate intent is effectively a compact between the board and its owners as to what performance the business will deliver.

CHAIR - Can I just be clear because we'll have GBEs next week and we'll have Hydro and TasNetworks in front of us. If I ask them across the table, Treasurer, because you won't be there, it'll be another minister at the time, that they stand by the estimates that are in your budget papers in return to their profitability and they'll be able to tell me how those figures have been arrived at. Will they be able to tell me that?

Mr ABETZ - You'll have to ask them.

CHAIR - You put them in your budget papers?

Mr ABETZ - Yes, because of the information they provided to us.

CHAIR - TasNetworks and Hydro have provided those figures to you in the forward Estimates as related to their profitability, is that correct?

Mr ABETZ - Yes, that is as I understand it.

CHAIR - I will ask them for the modelling that sits behind those figures, and they should be able to provide it because it's fed into the corporate plan. Is that correct?

Mr ABETZ - One, you will have to ask them, but with Hydro, as we know, they had lower than anticipated returns because of the extra dry two years that we've had. September, as I understand it, has been a lot better. The heavens have opened and Hydro is looking forward -

CHAIR - In October, the heavens opened, but anyway.

Mr ABETZ - Is looking forward to a better return.

CHAIR - Your budget papers, though, say the expectation is with that improvement, particularly in Hydro's profitability, is returned to average rainfall. Have they modelled that, or have you modelled that?

Ms O'CONNOR - No, they haven't modelled that.

CHAIR - I am asking the Treasurer, have you modelled that?

Mr ABETZ - No, we haven't.

Mr SWAIN - ReCFIT and State Growth are responsible for energy security policy advice to the Minister for Energy and Renewables. I think Hydro has over 100 years of hydrology records and will have certainly a hydrological view. I can't talk to the detail of that.

CHAIR - I will ask the minister for energy tomorrow.

Ms O'CONNOR - Treasurer, when Will Hodgman was elected Premier in 2014 within three months, he came back in with a fully formed state budget. You had three months or more to form an actual budget that dealt with the PEFO (Pre-Election Financial Outlook).

There are lots of blank lines in the out-years of your Budget. It feels like it's an act of subterfuge, basically, to get through the stadium vote, and then next May the real pain will be delivered and subsequently felt. 

Why didn't you prepare a fully formed budget? Was there any political consideration in your mind at all when you decided to bring in an interim one?

Mr ABETZ - I was waiting to see how long it would take for the stadium conspiracy to be raised -

Ms O'CONNOR - What's the conspiracy?

Mr ABETZ - That we have deliberately withheld information in relation to the Budget. As I indicated to you, you can do the maths, I had from 20 August to 15 September to lock away the figures.

CHAIR - David Crean did it in 1998 in exactly the same amount of time, with a change of government, I might add. 

Mr ABETZ - If I can answer, I don't know what David Crean may or may not have done in 1998; I do know the advice I was given by Treasury, very strongly and firmly, was that they need exactly two months - 
Ms O'CONNOR - To do what, sorry?

Mr ABETZ - To lock away the figures for quality assurance, et cetera, after the Budget Cabinet. From 15 September to 6 November was an exceptionally tight timeline for Treasury officials, and to the best of my ability, that is what I was advised, and I had no reason to doubt that advice. When I said, 'Can we make it a week shorter, with a lot of hard work?', it was agreed and, hence, we got a budget on 6 November rather than 13 November. 

Mr SWAIN - Treasurer, if I may, I note that the context was that we had a supply bill in place, and the supply bill, of course, has estimates of expenditure that go through to the end of December, but we were also very conscious of the need to bring in a proper full budget in advance of the supply bill coming to an end. 

Ms O'CONNOR - The Budget that we have has no sign of the explicit policy choices that were recommended in the PEFO, so it's hard not to form the view that this Budget is a sort of 'softly, softly' approach to get us through the stadium vote. Perhaps you could point us to any explicit policy choice in the Budget that leads us towards fiscal sustainability?

Mr ABETZ - The stadium issue was never discussed and never considered - 

Ms O'CONNOR - That's a worry.

Mr ABETZ - As part of the Budget timetable.

Ms O'CONNOR - Oh, I see.

Mr ABETZ - Your view on the stadium is well known, but we believe that the stadium is a very important part, as an economic enabler for our state, and that is why we want to see it progress; but I can assure you that the stadium considerations had nothing to do with the timetable for the Budget. 

Ms O'CONNOR - Are you able to tell the committee what your projection is for public sector job cuts over the forward Estimates from May? 

Mr ABETZ - We are looking at right-sizing the public service, and that will be 2800 public service jobs that we are looking at to see whether they will need to be refilled when and as they fall vacant.

Ms O'CONNOR - On that point, are we likely in May next year to see a different set of numbers for public-sector job cuts from what we've got in the interim Budget, given that Treasury's advice to you in the PEFO was that you're going to have to make some explicit policy choices, including potentially raising state revenue? What sort of different numbers are you looking at for May, in broad terms - just to give us some sign, at this point? 

Mr ABETZ - I'm not going to speculate other than to say we have indicated the pathway that we want to take to ensure that we reach a balanced budget, and in those circumstances decisions will need to be made, and one of those decisions is in relation to the size of the public service, keeping in mind 46 per cent of the Budget goes towards public service salaries, so that is a fair whack of the Budget. If you want to right-size the budget, it stands to reason that the size of the public service will need to be right-sized as well, given the substantial proportion that it takes.

Ms O'CONNOR - Just the last question on this line of questioning, we heard before from Mr Swain that some of what's impacted the Budget to date has been flood events and unusual events. You've projected a little over a $5 million surplus in this interim Budget in the out years. Do you agree that it's meaningless really because we're in an age of accelerating climate change and those extreme weather events are likely to more increasingly impact on budget sustainability and spending?

Mr ABETZ - The impact of that which you talk about, I'm not -

Ms O'CONNOR - Can you not say the words? Say 'climate change' - see how it goes.

Mr ABETZ - Can I finish the sentence without interruption, but I'm sure the Chair has noted and would not seek to encourage? The matters that you note are part-and-parcel of government advice through ReCFIT and that gets fed into all the government agencies.

Mr SWAIN - I did say a flood event I should have, if I could correct it, have said storm event.

CHAIR - I did think that it was more the storm that was the issue blowing everything down.

Ms THOMAS - It comes back to some of the opening questions that the Chair asked you, Treasurer, in relation to where to from here with budget repair and long-term reform. The budget papers, in the overview on page 7, talk about this Budget establishing the foundation for a renewed and sustained approach to long-term reform, and say the government is committed to embedding structural changes that enhance the efficiency, transparency and sustainability of public finances.

Can you give us any indication of what these structural changes will be, and will they include measures that have been recommended in the PEFO or in Saul Eslake's independent review of government finances, particularly with regard to new revenue streams?

Mr ABETZ - For what it's worth, I've met with Saul Eslake and intend to meet with him again and discuss his views. In economics there is no such thing - it's not an exact science. Different economists with different views come to situations with different perspectives and therefore come with different conclusions.

In relation to revenue, that is a matter that instinctively I don't like increasing the tax burden. But that said, as I've previously said, you never say never. We're looking at a whole range of the policy decisions to get us to the point where we need to be and want to be at the end of the forward Estimates.

Ms THOMAS - The government has clearly announced there will be no new taxes. Will the government consider other new revenue streams and what might they consider or are you saying there will be no new revenue streams implemented as part of the structural reform? 

Mr ABETZ - What we've said at this stage is no new taxes. We are mindful of the fact we're a minority government and therefore there may be alternate views put to us, and we will have to take them into account. We are looking at the short-term stay tax which is anticipated to raise $11 million to start as of 1 July next year. We are looking at those measures, and we've already announced those.

Mr SWAIN - Treasury's position is on the record through the PEFO, but I would note in discussions with the multi-party panel we have gone through the mathematics of the Budget where there is a greater level of control for the government over expenditure than there is over revenue - given that two-thirds of the revenue comes from the Commonwealth. In terms of the thing that the lever which the government has the greatest control over, it is expenditure.

CHAIR - Picking up a point that Cassy raised previously, you have confirmed the figure that the government plans to reduce the State Service by 2800 through vacancy control and natural attrition. I'd suggest this is not feasible to get anywhere near the sort of number that won't require compulsory redundancies, if you're trying to achieve it over the period that you're suggesting. How has the proposed reduction in the public sector of 2800 FTEs been calculated?

Mr ABETZ - Just trying to do the maths as we think, but if we've got a 30,000 public service in very round figures, 1 per cent would be 300, 5 per cent would be 1,500 over the forward Estimates, and I think they might be a bit low, but even at 5 per cent natural attrition over the forward Estimates, that 5 per cent per annum should be achievable.

CHAIR - That presumes every position is not going to be filled, though.

Mr ABETZ - No, it doesn't. 5 per cent would be 1500 per annum over the forward Estimates, which would give you a figure of 4500, and it's 2800 that we're looking at. So, there is a lot of space there.

Mr SWAIN - That number was also calculated off measure 10 in the current fiscal strategy, which assumes a ratio between the number of public servants and the population of Tasmania, and it applies - which we now have gone over that ratio - the ratio came from 2022-23, which is, I think, the first, if you like, 'normal' year post-COVID, and that has been applied to say what reduction would be required to the current number of paid FTEs to get you back within that fiscal strategy measure.

Mr ABETZ - And look, it would be good if there was some recognition of the need to right-size the public service. If that is recognised, then we might be able to have a discussion about the numbers, but if there is not that recognition, and it represents 46 per cent of the budget, then those who talk about the need to get to a balance in the budget - talk which I fully support, but if you're not willing to look at that substantial expenditure, then you're never going to get there.

CHAIR - I think the people you refer to, perhaps, Treasurer, are willing to look at all things, whereas you've ruled out some things, and that's the problem here. But anyway, I will move on.

Mr ABETZ - Well, there is nothing, with respect, Chair, in your questioning as to an acceptance -

CHAIR - We will get to that. We're talking about the staff reductions at the moment.

Mr ABETZ - An acceptance that there has to be - there is just a questioning of the numbers. You know, if I can rhetorically say, 'Well, what would your suggested number be?' Because, with respect in your opinion piece, I didn't find a suggested number - an accepted number by yourself - just an opposition or a belief that we couldn't achieve 2800. So, we, as a government, are looking for solutions, and everybody's talking budget repair -

CHAIR - And we are here to hold you to account for your solutions.

Mr ABETZ - Everybody's talking budget repair; nobody's providing any suggestion as to where -

CHAIR - That's not true, but anyway, I will move -

Ms O'CONNOR - You are the Treasurer.

CHAIR - If I can just ask -

Mr ABETZ - I am. I fully accept that.

Ms O'CONNOR - You're the one here to give the answers.

CHAIR - Can I ask whether there are any plans to introduce a redundancy program at all?

Mr ABETZ - Look - 

Mr SWAIN - No, not at the moment.

Mr ABETZ - No.

CHAIR - So, without a redundancy program, and potentially compulsory redundancies, how does the government intend to ensure public sector reductions are targeted to areas where there will be limited service delivery impacts?

Mr ABETZ - Look, that will be up to each departmental secretary and head of agency to make those calls and determinations, and we are working our way through that, and each and every departmental head will need to make his or her decision.

CHAIR - So, if we ask that same question to each departmental head, they should be able to respond to that question?

Mr ABETZ - I would suspect that they will tell you that they're getting on with it to ascertain how they're going to achieve targets.

CHAIR - Has each department got a particular target depending on their staff level, or are some not -

Mr SWAIN - That work is ongoing. As you mentioned, the work on the next budget has commenced, but only relatively recently. There's a level of aspiration that is being discussed with the government, but the detailed work on how that will be allocated is ongoing. Obviously, in relation to the attrition option, the level of turnover in different departments will differ; but I can say in Treasury's case we were about 17 per cent about a year ago, and now we're at about 12 per cent, so the attrition - 

CHAIR - I did notice there's been a reduction in spending in Treasury. 

Mr SWAIN - Yes. I was just going to - that will be different in different departments. With a degree of difficulty, under the State Service arrangements, secretaries can move people between positions. It's not done that much, but it can occur, and the Premier can move people who are in the SES (Senior Executive Service) between positions.

The ongoing policy position in relation to employment obviously comes through DPAC (Department of Premier and Cabinet) and SSMO (State Service Management Office) to the Premier. What I'm saying is there's a lot of work to do on the allocation of targets, and some of the policy positions may be discussed through that process. That's a matter for the Premier. 

Ms LOVELL - On that answer, you talked about how a level of 'aspiration' has been discussed. Can you elaborate on that a little more? Have targets been discussed? Have departments brought that to you, or have you brought that to departments? What kind of discussions have happened around that?

Mr SWAIN - I don't want to get ahead of the Treasurer. I'm simply saying what the Treasurer has already said: if you look at the cash borrowing requirements and the cashflow statement, that gives you an indication, and what the Treasurer has said publicly in terms of arriving at peak debt, that says to you that the government understands the quantum of the challenge, but there's more work to do on how that is allocated. 

Ms LOVELL - Allocated across departments, okay. When would you expect to have that work done? Would we see that in next year's Budget, or in the May Budget, or sooner? 

Mr SWAIN - As the Treasurer has said, there's typically about two months required to put the budget together post the finalisation of the numbers, so you can back-calculate from May.

CHAIR - Has Treasury provided an estimate, then, of the proposed reduction in costs associated with the 2800 FTEs you expect to not fill the positions of, that actually leave the public sector?

Mr SWAIN - No, because we won't know which 2800; we are not at that point. 

CHAIR - I'll rephrase the question. Is there an amount that needs to be achieved to facilitate the expectations that are embedded in the Budget in terms of the amount - not the numbers because they do depend on the positions that are not replaced, but what's the amount we are looking at? 

Mr SWAIN - You can see the residual challenge in that cash deficit that you identified. I would say that that number, if you take the average cost of a public servant at about $135,000 and multiply that by 2800, that won't fully address the budget challenge; so there will need to be other measures including looking at the way capital and equity decisions are made in next year's Budget as well.

CHAIR - Cassie, you had one on this particular matter. 

Ms O'CONNOR - I do. Treasurer, in the last three financial years we've seen supplementary appropriations in the order of hundreds of millions of dollars. It's become a strategy of your government - in fact, this precedes you - to under-budget for key services to make the budget look better, only to have to make enormous supplementary appropriations to make up the shortfall. 

This Budget makes some headway in accounting for under-budgeting identified in the PEFO, but most matters are not addressed. This includes $24 million in out-of-home care costs; $5.6 million for Ashley Youth Detention Centre costs; while $1.3 million is provided for community corrections and Magistrate Court cost complexities. That's only for two years. The PEFO says the actual cost is in the order of $10 million. The reality is just one of these costs would make your notional 2028-29 surplus disappear.

If the glide path to surplus is based on fabricated data, the plane will still crash and burn, Treasurer. When will you start making the budget to reflect the actual cost of services?

Mr ABETZ - Look, lots in that question. Can I start at the beginning with your assertion that there was a strategy in the Budget and then with supplementary appropriations later on. I think we all know, and if we don't we should know, that the biggest area was health. Thankfully, finally, we've been getting it out to the public, and I've banged on about this a few times at Question Time that we have 100 people that are referred to - I'm not sure it's the most dignified way of referring to them - but as bed-blockers - 

Ms LOVELL - That's actually an offensive term. I think it's highly inappropriate. 

Ms O'CONNOR - But also, it's a diversion from the question. 

Mr ABETZ - It is used by others. 

Ms LOVELL - That doesn't mean you have to use it though. 

CHAIR - It is something that you probably shouldn't use. 

Ms O'CONNOR - It is used in the hospital unfortunately. 

Ms LOVELL - That doesn't mean that you have to use it. 

Mr ABETZ - It is used among professionals. We know what we're talking about. Eighty of them cannot find aged-care places. Twenty of them can't find disability care places. We all know federal government responsibility. We are backfilling that cost; three wards of our hospital are full with people who are medically ready to be discharged but can't be discharged because we have a lack of support from the federal government and, if I might say, federal governments. 

I don't want to make this into a federal-Labor or whatever issue - this is federal governments over the years - have not funded aged and disability care as they should. As a result, we are backfilling and so that is a huge cost that we are bearing in the medical area. 

Ms O'CONNOR - That's one agency though. I accept at some level what you're saying - 

Mr ABETZ - Yes, but with the supplementaries, somebody can - 

Ms O'CONNOR - but with each agency, right down to corrections, for example - 

Mr ABETZ - Yes, but somebody can help me out of the supplementaries. The health bit contributed what?

Mr SWAIN - I think it was $345 million. 

Mr ABETZ - Yes, out of?

CHAIR - Four-hundred-and-nintey or something, I think.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, just under half a billion. It was about - what - three-quarters in very rough terms or thereabouts. That is the lion's share of it. Look, with the other areas, what it tells me, and hopefully informs other agencies as well, is they have got to restrain their spending and ensure that they keep within the budgets that they are provided.

Ms O'CONNOR - Thank you, Treasurer, the PEFO notes that the under-budgeting for injured workers support in the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management was about $14.5 million. The Budget has accounted for the full $14.5 million across the forward Estimates, but it's not so pleasing to note that this appears to be the only example of under-budgeting identified in the PEFO that this Budget fully and consistently addresses. Why hasn't this Budget, why haven't you, as Treasurer, addressed all the other examples of under-budgeting identified in the PEFO?

Mr ABETZ - What that would suggest is that you would want to see increased budgeting in all those areas at the same time that - 

Ms O'CONNOR - Maybe more honesty in the numbers. 

Mr ABETZ - At the same time as your party voted with others to send us to an election because we weren't engaging in budget repair. You can't, with respect, have it both ways: demand budget repair and then demand extra expenditure in a whole host of areas. 

Ms O'CONNOR - Cute deflection. 

CHAIR - If you could just restate the question. 

Ms O'CONNOR - Lack of courage manifests - lack of courage in this Budget. Why haven't you addressed all the other examples of under-funding that were identified in the PEFO? Will they be addressed in May?

Mr SWAIN - There are some true-ups in this Budget. Health is nearly an extra billion dollars coming off the sub-appropriation. There are uplifts in corrections, there are uplifts in at-home care, there are uplifts in parks. I'm trying to think where else, but they're the front-of-mind ones. We have - 

CHAIR - Education, one might think. 

Mr SWAIN - Yes, we have gone through and looked for patterns and sub-appropriation, additional funding, and tried to address some of those in individual budget items. It is still the case that the overall expenses are aggressive, and a lot of work needs to be done to achieve those forward expenditures.

Mr ABETZ - Can I just, if I may quickly, Chair for Ms Lovell's benefit in particular, your colleague Ms Haddad has used the term bed-blocker.

Ms LOVELL - Well, I will raise the same issue with her. It's not a term that we should be using. I do have a question.

Treasurer, you said that agencies have been advised they will need to constrain their spending to within the Budget provided. Does that mean we won't be seeing any supplementary appropriation bills this year for health or any other departments?

Mr ABETZ - Look, I get into trouble from time to time for saying never say never, but I think anybody that has heard what I've said and seen what's being printed knows that there will be a very strong imprimatur that will be frowned upon most seriously. But you can never foretell certain events. Therefore, to say that there won't be any supplementary payments or appropriations - you can't, in the real world, rule it out. I know people like the black-and-white of politics to say that, 'It definitely won't happen'. Unless you've got a crystal ball and you know exactly what's going to happen in the future, you can't rule it out. That said, if the extra expenditure is just because of loose budgeting or loose administration of an area, that will be frowned upon most severely, I can assure you.

Ms LOVELL - Okay, so the - we will explore this further with the health minister, but the health annual report showed that there was significantly more money spent in the last financial year then is allocated in the Budget for this financial year, in particular for operational expenditure. Have you had conversations with the health department about what level of cuts they can sustain without cutting services to bring that in line with what's been allocated? Where has that number come from, the number that you've allocated? What discussions were had around that?

CHAIR - Forty-eight million dollars.

Ms LOVELL - Twenty-eight million dollars?

CHAIR - Forty-eight million dollars.

Ms LOVELL - Forty-eight million dollars.

CHAIR - Forty-eight between what was spent this year and what's budgeted - sorry, spent last year, budgeted next year.

Ms LOVELL - I mean, we're not talking about extraordinary - we're not talking about a pandemic or any kind of extraordinary circumstances like that. There was nothing like that in the last financial year that would have boosted blowing that spending out. What cuts are you expecting the health department to have to make to meet that budget? Have you had conversations with them about -

Mr ABETZ - This Budget?

Ms LOVELL - This Budget.

CHAIR - The 2025-26.

Ms LOVELL - Yes, this financial year.

Mr ABETZ - This Budget shows an increase in expenditure on health.

Ms LOVELL - No, it doesn't. Not compared to what they've spent in their annual report.

Mr ABETZ - Budget to Budget, there has been an increase.

Ms LOVELL - Can I take you back there? I'm not disagreeing with that.

CHAIR - I think the question was -

Ms LOVELL - That's not the question. Budget to Budget means very little at the end of the day. It actually means nothing because what was allocated in last year's Budget was not what was spent and that's clear in the annual report.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, and I've outlined why.

Ms LOVELL - Yes. What I'm talking about is the amount of money that was spent in the annual report. There is a significant shortfall between what was spent in health in the last financial year and what's been allocated in this financial year's Budget. You've just said that agencies are expected to constrain their spending to within the Budget provided. My question is: What conversations were had with health about meeting that reduction in spending?

Mr ABETZ - Look, the major discussion that we have had - might I add that I'm not alone in this. All treasurers, all health ministers and all chief ministers -

Ms LOVELL - But I'm specifically asking -

Mr ABETZ - No, no, no.

Ms LOVELL - I'm just mindful of time. We've got limited time today. We've got a very long day.

Mr ABETZ - But this is vital for the health budget that we understand the underfunding from the federal government -

Ms LOVELL - We've already covered that.

Mr ABETZ - That we are trying to deal with.

Ms LOVELL - That's not what this is about though. This is about their operational expenditure. You're talking about underfunding, people are going to be kicked out of hospital with nowhere to go, if that's what - that's the bottom line. We've covered the Commonwealth funding -

Mr ABETZ - Ms Lovell, as we know, people aren't being kicked out with nowhere to go -

Ms LOVELL - We've covered that extensively.

Mr ABETZ - - and that is why we've got 100 people that are ready for discharge, could be discharged, but because -

Ms LOVELL - That's not my question, Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - But that is three wards of people -

CHAIR - Can I try re-phrasing this question?

Ms LOVELL - I don't think we need to rephrase it. You've heard the question. The question is very clear. You've spoken extensively about the issue with people being stuck in hospital with nowhere to go. We all understand that's an issue, so we can put that aside. My question is what conversations have you had with the health department about meeting that target, about how they're going to constrain their spending within the budget that's been allocated to them?

CHAIR - Which is less than what they spent last year.

Ms LOVELL - My follow-up question was going to be: do you know how they're going with that so far, this financial year? I expect they're probably pretty close to blowing that budget already.

Mr ABETZ - Look, the Department of Health has identified the following proposed strategies to meet the efficiency requirements. There's a whole host of areas: reducing consultancies, improving contract management, consolidating corporate and policy functions, consolidating office accommodation, reduction in operating costs, including areas such as supplies and consumables, communication costs, postage and freight, staff travel, vehicle expenses, improving pathology test-ordering practices, consistent use of prosthesis and reviewing and standardising rostering practices to decrease overtime and agency staffing costs.

Ms LOVELL - In the absence of a pandemic or any extraordinary circumstances, say we have another fairly normal year in the health system and they're not able to confine $48 million worth of savings amongst that list, what will happen then?

Mr ABETZ - That is hypothetical, if what will happen then? I don't have a crystal ball and there are some -
CHAIR - Supplementary appropriation, you don't need a crystal ball.

Ms LOVELL - That's my question, will more money be allocated?

Mr ABETZ - Chair, I was asked about savings. I've read out a whole list and then I'm asked if this whole list somehow doesn't deliver that which is being sought, what will happen then? Well, this list is part and parcel of delivering that.

Ms LOVELL - If they're not able to deliver those savings, will more money be allocated to the health department through supplementary appropriation?

Mr ABETZ - We have confidence that they can, and your question is hypothetical. If they can't, then what? You could ask that about every single budgetary and expenditure item contained in the Budget and the forward Estimates.

Ms LOVELL - It's a Budget into the future; there are a lot of hypotheticals.

Mr ABETZ - Of course there are, and that is why you cannot give a specific answer that something is going to cost in the second year $1.10 as opposed to $1.09 or $1.11. Chances are we're dealing with bigger numbers than that.

Mr SWAIN - On agencies managing within budget, obviously that's the core responsibility of the secretary and their executive, but I just wanted to note that under the Financial Management Act, there are powers to move funds between outputs. You would expect the agency, if all of those measures were not delivering the savings, to look at any output that was underspent and use the powers under the FMA that are available to the secretary and the minister and if you need to move money between portfolios with different ministers, then there's also an opportunity to talk to the Treasurer about that with his powers under the FMA.

Ms LOVELL - You would be lucky to find anything underspent in the health budget. But yes, I appreciate that. Thank you.

Mr SWAIN - I suppose I was making the point it's a very big Budget.

Ms THOMAS - The budget overview talks about the election commitments on page four - talks about consistent with the approach - the 2025-26 Budget includes only some of the 2025 election commitments. Could you tell us which ones it does include and how they were determined or prioritised for inclusion in this Budget when others weren't?

Mr ABETZ - That I may have to take on notice because there are a number of -

Mr SWAIN - Going to budget paper 2, volume one, page 10 there is a table that gives the election commitments that are funded in this Budget via agency. There is a breakdown table 1.4 on the following page by agency as to what those election commitments are.

Ms THOMAS - My question was: there are a number of election commitments that weren't included in this Budget. Can you tell me how the ones that were included were chosen over the ones that weren't and why?

Mr ABETZ - They would have been done on a case-by-case basis and our representations to most of them were that we had a budget in May, and therefore under normal circumstances, that Budget would have gone through and then promises made would have been included in the following Budget in May 2026. And so, that is where we will be looking at the others. But as to the exact decision as to why one was in, one was out, or one has been deferred, I can't -

CHAIR - Can you provide a list of those that aren't in there, so we can easily see which ones are in.

Mr ABETZ - Yes.

CHAIR - Can you -

Mr ABETZ - That must be possible, so I'll take that on notice.

CHAIR - A list of the election commitments that aren't included.

Ms O'CONNOR - Also an indication of whether they will be in the future.

Mr ABETZ - Yes. I can take -

Ms THOMAS - Yes, that was my next question. I note that the list is included in the Budget of those that are funded. It would be helpful if you could provide on notice a list of those election commitments which weren't funded in this Budget.

It would be also helpful if you are able to provide some more information on how the ones that were funded and why there was a sense of urgency to include those in this Budget but not the other ones, and how the government intends to commit to including them in the next Budget in May.

Mr SWAIN - Obviously, I can't speak for the government on this, but the election commitments that aren't in the budget papers would be dealt with through the next budget cycle.

Ms THOMAS - So, there can be no guarantee that they will actually be included in the 2026-27 Budget?

Mr ABETZ - Our intention is that they will be, but until we're there, circumstances might change or whatever. So, I don't want to commit 100 per cent, but that is our intention.

Ms O'CONNOR - Just getting back to the sort of subterfuge that is in this Budget -

Mr ABETZ - Hah.

Ms O'CONNOR - But it is. It is. Sort of underfunding across the forwards, blank lines -

We have an example here of Tasmanian prison services, and there's a line item in the Budget that talks about cost pressures. The purpose of only funding this for one year is solely to preserve the forward Estimates' bottom lines. This is really clear, because the cost pressures in the prison system are not going to go away. What is your spin is on this one.

Are you actually suggesting there is a world where corrections staff pay cheques come due and the government doesn't pay? And if not, why does your Budget keep this option open other than for the purposes of deceiving people about the bottom line?

Mr ABETZ - OK, 'subterfuge', 'spin', 'deceiving' - all those are words that are conducive to getting objective information, but I will take that on notice, unless somebody's got some. Yes, I will -

Ms O'CONNOR - Just on this line of questioning: the line item reading health demand allocates $231 million. The Pre-Election Financial Outlook Report puts the actual cost at $345 million. Can we look forward to a supplementary appropriation, for example  and this goes to Ms Lovell's question  to cover that extra $114 million shortfall in the future?

Mr ABETZ - Well, I have answered in relation to my approach to supplementals, but-

Ms O'CONNOR - Well, what we're trying to get to the bottom of here is just consistent underfunding to make the bottom line in the budget look better - then we end up with the supplementary appropriation.

You claim a flimsy $5.6 million surplus in the final year of the Budget. So far in the questions that I've asked you, we've discussed about $179 million in expenses per year that your government will accrue but hasn't budgeted for. How do you explain that and how are you going to cover it?

Mr ABETZ - Well, it's interesting with all this that we were sent to an election on the basis of budget repairs -

Ms THOMAS - You weren't sent to an election.

Ms O'CONNOR - This is a deflection.

Mr ABETZ - No - and each and every time, all I'm being told about is 'underfunding', which would suggest you want extra money in the Budget, which would be for -

CHAIR - Can you reframe - just re-pose the question? Just the question.

Ms O'CONNOR - The question is: given that in this Budget it is clear that there is consistent underfunding in order to make the bottom line look better  and I've just given you some examples of an extra $179 million in costs -

CHAIR - The question?

Ms O'CONNOR - Well, the question is: why are you trying to hide the true costs of government operations in this Budget? 

Mr ABETZ - I don't accept the premise of your question and I reject that which you asserted at the end. This is a Budget that is interim. I have indicated that the interim Budget is the foundation on which we are going to build for the future sustainability of our budget. Let's be clear: that will require some tough decisions. Nobody likes doing that which will be required; but if you want budget repair, I would just look forward to some genuine examples of how we can get the budget back into shape, keeping in mind that two-thirds of our revenue we aren't the masters of. One third is ours, so the real area for us to deal with is on the expenditure side. 

Ms O'CONNOR - It would be fair to say, though, wouldn't it, that the forward Estimates in this interim Budget lack credibility?

Mr ABETZ - I've just been assisted: after the 2024-25 supplementary appropriations, we have put that there for everybody to see, and we are now doing a re-calibration exercise. I think the secretary, in fact, spoke to that.

Mr SWAIN - Yes. There are a couple of things going on in the Budget. There's true-ups of individual line items, which I did speak to. There may be some where there's further work to do. There are also global savings measures that have to be applied and have to be transferred into outcomes. Just if I could, the PEFO is a statement of Treasury's view, applying a particular methodology of what outcomes will occur without intervention. From a Treasury point of view, what we want to see is - 

CHAIR - Intervention.

Mr SWAIN - a credible diversion from PEFO numbers in future budgets. 

Ms O'CONNOR - Treasurer, do you acknowledge that that flimsy $5.6 million fourth-year surplus relies on the supposition that your government will elect not to continue funding for a wide range of commission of inquiry recommendations, as well as your own election promises like the school lunch program?

Mr ABETZ - No, I don't.

Ms O'CONNOR - That's what the numbers indicate in the interim Budget: all those dotted little flat empty lines.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, and the full picture, as we said in the interim Budget, will be painted in May.

Ms O'CONNOR - It's likely to be an ugly picture, though, isn't it?

Mr ABETZ - It's not going to be as rosy a picture as one would like, but it's a task that we should be, and need to be, committed to, and we, as the government, are up for it. We look forward to the support of all those that have been talking about budget repair actually coming up with some suggestions of budget repair.

Ms LOVELL - With all the advisers we have.

Mr SWAIN - In relation to improving the accuracy of expense forecasts, that does go two ways. There are the adjustments that I've talked about, but there are also situations where the money can't be spent, and Treasury will be advising the Treasurer that where that is demonstrable, that funding should be reallocated to other things. That is particularly the case in capital, where there's been a significant under-delivery this year, for example, about a 30 per cent under-delivery, so there are funds that are not going to be spent. 

I'm picking up the part of your question relating to the commission of inquiry in a very general sense. There are also changes to budgets that are not about a change in position; they're about a recognition of what agencies can actually get out the door. 

Ms O'CONNOR - The powers under the Financial Management Act to reallocate funding - we were talking before in the context of the health budget, for example - have they been exercised by government before, where you use the funds from one agency to top up or complement - 

Mr SWAIN - Yes is the short answer. 

CHAIR - That's reported department - 

Mr SWAIN - Mm.

CHAIR - If I could go, Treasurer, just for a couple things related to the PEFO. Acknowledging the format under which it's developed, what advice have you sought, Treasurer, on the matters that are referred to in the PEFO which shows extensive work needs to be done as part of the development of this interim Budget, and obviously the work that's going on already on the 2026-27 Budget. What advice have you sought about mitigating or responding to those challenges identified in the PEFO?

Mr ABETZ - Look, I'm not going to go into the specific advice that I am given by the departments. Suffice to say that on becoming Treasurer, taking a very detailed look at the finances and the fact that we had a vote of no confidence in us -

CHAIR - I'm asking what advice you got. That's got nothing to do with it. What advice have you sought in relation to responding to the risks and problems identified in the PEFO?

Mr ABETZ - If I can finish - and being sent to an election on the basis of the need for budget repair, you can be assured that one of my very first questions of Treasury was, how do we come to a position where the budget is once again sustainable and how quickly can we achieve it? Can we make all the savings, for example, in 2026-27? Of course the answer was no because the shock in the economy would be too great. It would be sensible to wean ourselves off deficit budgeting, and then at the forward Estimates -

CHAIR - Let me narrow the question down. When seeking that advice, acknowledging the problem, did you ask for advice around all areas of possible budget repair or just reducing expenditure? We did talk about it earlier, that's the easier lever for the government, but did you seek advice around all other options?

Mr ABETZ - Look, I have sought advice in a whole host of areas. Until the May Budget comes down, I don't want to sort of speculate on that -

CHAIR - I'm not asking you to speculate.

Mr ABETZ - But I don't mind saying that in the time that I had with an economist I asked, 'What's your advice in relation to', and -

CHAIR - I'm asking about Treasury advice, Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - Yes. Look, Treasury advice - I'm continually seeking advice and getting -

CHAIR - Did you ask for advice around all measures that are possible to influence budget repair, noting that other economists have said you need to pull all levers, not just one.

Mr SWAIN - Treasurer, if I may just add one thing: one thing with the PEFO is that it is a projection, not a forecast, which is important for the reason I said before.

CHAIR - I'm asking about advice, which areas of advice.

Mr SWAIN - I was going to move to that. I was just going to say that the Treasurer has supported, through the multi-partisan panel, detailed presentations from me on the PEFO and its aspects, and its various recommendations to the multi-partisan panel.

CHAIR - Just to go to that then, if I might. In the Legislative Council recently, the Leader of Government also stated that the intention being that the panel will be involved in working with the government as it develops a new fiscal strategy to be included in the 2026-27 Budget, and that there would also be consultation with members of this place.

The Leader for Government did, however, also state that under Tasmania's Westminster system the executive is accountable to parliament for financial management decisions. Ministers sit in the parliament precisely so they can be questioned and held to account. However, parliament's role is one of scrutiny and oversight, not one of co-decision-making in this context. It was the Leader on behalf of the government who said that.

Could you, Treasurer, clarify then the role of the panel and other members of parliament in the development of the government's new fiscal strategy and when this involvement will take place?

Mr ABETZ - The involvement is, if you like, an iterative process with the panel that continues from meeting to meeting. The panel itself, I think quite rightly, wants to understand the issues, understand the opportunities, the difficulties, et cetera. In serving or being part of the panel they don't want to be - what's a term I can use - get onto the sticky paper of then it being asserted that they formulated the Budget.

CHAIR - Well, there's no public process around that. How could anyone be asserted of that? It's all behind closed doors.

Mr ABETZ - Well, I think, for example, Mr Bayley, the member on the panel, might have something to say if I were to assert that this is a Budget fully endorsed by the Greens. Of course it isn't - and that is why at the very beginning, with that panel discussion, it was about informing as much as possible, retaining the importance of the Westminster system, about the executive government, but also being very mindful - as I said at the first - I think it was the first or second budget panel - we are very mindful of the fact that we are a minority government, and, therefore, a minority government that just sort of 'blinkers' itself and doesn't want to take into account the views of other members in the parliament, that may not necessarily be a very good and conducive strategy for either budget repair or for the long-term -

CHAIR - So, it's entirely the executive's job to deliver the budget and the measures, you're saying, and whatever the members of the panel might think or say has no bearing?

Mr ABETZ - No, no, no. That is exactly not what I said, Chair. It is for the executive to determine the budget. I think we accept that, especially in the Westminster system. In the scenario of being a minority government, I think it would be an ill-advised government not to take into account some views or suggestions that may be made during the discussions in the panel - which I suppose I've got the right to accept or reject, but I've got a funny feeling if I were to sort of dismiss them all and reject them all, the parliament, in which we don't have a majority, might have something to say. Therefore, this will be the art of putting things together - as has already happened, might I add, in this parliament, where one day we're accused of being in bed with Labor by the Greens, and then the next day we're accused by Labor of being in bed with -

CHAIR - Okay, we're getting off the point, I think. We might come back to the budget matters.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, but I'm just explaining to you that in a minority government, that is how it works - and whilst we have the responsibility of delivering the government, we will be informing ourselves of the views of other members of the parliament without any official duty, if you like, of accepting those views, but it might be wiser of us to be cognisant of those views.

Ms O'CONNOR - It's an encouraging expression of humility and reality we're hearing from you, about dealing with the reality of minority government.

Mr ABETZ - I have always been of that view of the minority government scenario. I've said it a number of times. You'll go watch Question Time down our way, a bit more.

Ms O'CONNOR - Oh, I sometimes do.

CHAIR - Let's just go back to the Budget that we are scrutinising in here. Can I just ask, Treasurer, how regularly does Treasury provide reports to the Treasurer on the Budget, and how things are tracking?

Mr ABETZ - Well, look, I have weekly meetings with Treasury officials, so I get -

CHAIR - I'm asking about actual reports. Do you get - are you provided with reports from Treasury on how the Budget's tracking, and how often?

Mr SWAIN - Can I say -  on specific matters, we obviously deal with those in the regular weekly meeting and through our advice, but the budget committee also has regular reporting every time it meets.

Ms O'CONNOR - Of Cabinet? The budget committee of Cabinet?

Mr SWAIN - Yes.

Ms O'CONNOR - Right.

CHAIR - So you get weekly reports, is that what you're telling me? I just want - I'm interested in how often you get a formal report about how things are tracking, as Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - Well, the weekly meetings -

CHAIR - No, I'm asking about a report, not a meeting. I'm asking about some output from a meeting or a process that gives you something that you can look at and see how various departments are tracking against budget.

Mr SWAIN - The formal reporting is through the budget committee, and it is a committee of Cabinet, so I'm not sure how far -

CHAIR - Well, how often does that occur? How often is there a formal report out of that process?

Mr SWAIN - Typically - bearing in mind we haven't been in a normal situation for a little while, but typically it would meet monthly at a minimum and potentially more through the lead-up to the Budget. Of course, outside of that, there are a range of meetings with the Treasurer to supplement the budget committee.

CHAIR - For the budget committee reports, how many - which months have they been delivered in the 2025-26 year to date?

Mr SWAIN - We're not in a normal budget situation. Normally the budget mightn't change but [inaudible] authority. Normally you would have eight to 10 months to put a budget together, there'd be a lead-in process -

CHAIR - I'm talking about tracking against budget, not about that. Let's stick with the question.

Mr SWAIN - In the context of a budget that's being put together in 11 weeks. There's been August and September reporting. There's been an August report and a September report that's about to occur.

CHAIR - The reports indicate then that we're on track for spending in the departments? And you mentioned previously, the reason I asked this is about, are we tracking against the expenditure against the supply bills?

Mr SWAIN - We're tracking okay against the supply bills overall, but we do obviously the parliament has an important task to get the budget, but there are overs and unders.

CHAIR - When you look at the tracking against the supply bills, where are the overs? Which departments have overs already?

Mr SWAIN - I'd say risks; there are known risks in some departments.

CHAIR - Which ones, I'm asking.

Mr SWAIN - One of those is DCYP, and that is the relating in part to the out-of-home care and child services area; there's a range of risks in that area.

CHAIR - Any others?

Mr SWAIN - That's the front-of-mind risk, I have to say.

CHAIR - Sorry, I'm just interested in that we've got a supply budget that runs out in December, hence we're here with the Budget as is right and proper. I'm just interested in what reports you get, Treasurer, in relation to the tracking of against appropriation in the supply bill across each department.

Mr ABETZ - I expect to be told in the event that things are off track.

Mr SWAIN - If I could just say, as well as the formal reporting that I have had through secretary's board and with a number of the secretaries who are of the larger agencies just had an informal arrangement to request that they advise me if they become aware of any significant realisation of over-expenditure risks, and there's been nothing raised outside of what's being reported to the budget committee.

CHAIR - Is health tracking online with their supply bill.

Mr SWAIN - I believe health is tracking okay at this time.

Ms O'CONNOR - We know that Marinus has been identified as a risk in the Budget - future funding for Marinus. Do you have the modelling that was undertaken for the whole-of-state business case? It shows that Hydro will return about $470 million to the state budget in future years, and the question was asked of the minister for energy in the other place, and we thought, Treasurer, you might be in a better position to answer it.

Mr SWAIN - The whole-of-state business case was Treasury advice. It obviously contains a range of very sensitive information including noting the fact that the Commonwealth also has ownership of Snowy Hydro, which is a direct potential competitor to Hydro. That number that you mentioned is a nominal on-average return, so it just needs to be understood on that basis.

Ms O'CONNOR - Based on what?

Mr SWAIN - A whole range of modelling that we did. We effectively started with the modelling that the businesses had done and then we got some independent modelling done around that and looked at a number of different scenarios.

Ms O'CONNOR - Is the committee able to see any of that modelling?

Mr ABETZ - I doubt it.

Mr SWAIN - It's set out in the whole-of-state business case, which I believe is redacted.

Mr ABETZ - Nothing has been provided of that.

CHAIR - Lots of the modelling redacted?

Mr SWAIN - There are some commercial sensitivities in it because Hydro doesn't want to signal to its competitors what its future trading strategy will be to maximise its profit in the national market.

Ms O'CONNOR - Was the modelling inclusive, for example, of any climate projections, any of the information that's provided in the state climate risk assessment or the National Climate Risk Assessment which shows that there'll be - over the next century - significant impacts on hydro storages. 

Mr SWAIN - Treasurer, I'd have to take that on notice. I believe hydrology was considered in the hydro modelling which we then reviewed, but I would have to confirm that.

Ms O'CONNOR - Okay. I would have thought it was a given and understood that was factored into the model, if you want to have accurate modelling.

CHAIR - He said he would take it on notice.

Ms O'CONNOR - No, but it sounds like there's an uncertainty about whether climate was factored in, which would surprise me. Particularly, for Hydro.

Mr SWAIN - Well, I mean, just remember - 

Mr ABETZ - Just take it on notice.

Mr SWAIN - Obviously within limits, if there's extremely dry years for year after year that would be problematic, but that modelling is about maximising financial outcomes. One of the reasons that - I mean it's quite intuitive - one of the reasons that whole-of-state business case says that Marinus is likely on average to produce returns is that you have installed capacity already that you don't have to spend capital on - 

Ms O'CONNOR - In the dam?

Mr SWAIN - No, in the generation plant with Hydro and you have a fuel cost which has an opportunity cost but has a financial cost of $0. You're paying $0.00 for the capital and $0 for the fuel and you're releasing the installed capacity that's in the Hydro system already. A lot of that is about being able to trade the energy into the market at the right point of the day, week, month and year. It's not just supply. Physical supply is clearly important, but it's not the only determinant of value. 

Ms O'CONNOR - Has Treasury tested Hydro's projections and assumptions?

Mr SWAIN - Yes.

Ms O'CONNOR - OK, and so you're comfortable with that number $470 million returned from Hydro in the out years.

Mr SWAIN - That number came from the whole-of-state business case, so yes. It's a nominal average return. The key point is it will vary year-to-year and there are some important assumptions. One of them is that the national market's design is not fundamentally changed. There are some important assumptions in it.

I can't stress enough that it is an average return. The importance of that is - Treasury's advice will be that the return shouldn't be spent in advance. They need to be - I suppose from Treasury's perspective - they need to occur and then be managed through the budget process when they've actually occurred, not pre-committed, because in a given year they may not emerge.

Ms O'CONNOR - In terms of unfunded costings. There's a whole range of them associated with the Macquarie Point stadium project which has been identified by Treasury. Including, for example, the $75 million for the northern access road, the rapid transit, pedestrian access infrastructure, the two-storey car park into the mud of the river. Should the stadium be approved, how does the government plan to fund those extra costs, given that there's no allocation for them and we're churning towards $13 billion net debt within a few years?

Mr ABETZ - The northern access road is funded already and that was under the Hobart City Deal 2019 or 2018.

Ms O'CONNOR - That money is in the bank?

CHAIR - It's in the Budget.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, it's in the Budget, and as I had occasion to say the other day: no stadium, no team, but the northern access road, yes. It's going to happen irrespective. That said, the stadium will of course leverage off the benefit of the northern access road should it be built. It will be built in any event, irrespective of the stadium's approval.

Ms O'CONNOR - Getting back then to all those unfunded extra costs associated with the stadium which have been identified by the Planning Commission and by Treasury. What's the plan for that, should parliament make the mistake of approving the order?

Mr ABETZ - It won't be a mistake. It'll be a very positive thing.

Ms O'CONNOR - We're talking your budget disaster; it will be a mistake.

Mr ABETZ - That aside. With the footpath, as I understand it, that is not a requirement -

Ms O'CONNOR - Keep pulling out little bits.

Mr ABETZ - Well, you mentioned individual items. I debunk each individual item and then you accuse me of pulling out individual items.

Ms O'CONNOR - There's a whole suite of unfunded extra infrastructure and works that are required.

Mr ABETZ - Out of that list, two of them I've already debunked in relation to the car park and we have Macquarie Point Development this afternoon.

CHAIR - Would you rather that question be posed then?
Ms O'CONNOR - I think he should be able to answer it. This is a Treasury question.

Mr ABETZ - We and the Macquarie Point Development are confident and satisfied that the figures that have been provided and put forward will allow the stadium to go ahead. As to the so-called extra costs [Bookmark: Phr2_O=28.0_D=3.4_C=0.42] , I debunked them during the stadium debate in the other place - 

Ms O'CONNOR - Are you saying they don't exist, or that they'll be funded by debt?

Mr ABETZ - They don't exist, like the northern access road is already funded. The footpath is not necessary. The car park - I don't have my head around that.

Mr SWAIN - The car parks would have to be a question to Macquarie Point Development. I think they're looking at the extent to which they can get commercial funding into that.

Ms O'CONNOR - They've had such great luck with private interest in the stadium project so far.

CHAIR - That's a statement. Can I go to unfunded things, Treasurer. I am sure you're very aware, as a shareholder minister, of the challenges facing TT-Line. You say they're not insolvent; the Auditor-General says they are. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=78.6_D=3.9_C=0.76]  On what basis do you make that claim they are solvent?

Mr ABETZ -  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=84.2_D=27.1_C=0.81] On the basis that they're able to pay their debts as they fall due. Let me preface my remarks by saying I have full faith and confidence in the Auditor-General. If I may quickly divert, when I was a lawyer I had full confidence in the Chief Justice, but the Chief Justice sitting individually sometimes made a decision which the full court would overturn - 

CHAIR - Can I go back to the question, Treasurer? The question is about the solvency of TT-Line. You say they're solvent; you disagree with the Auditor-General, who has formed an opinion based on their capacity to pay not just their debt this year, but also looking forward. Clearly they have debt to finish berth three, and debt associated with running the four vessels at the moment, with Spirit V being currently in Leith in Scotland. On what basis do you say they're solvent without additional government injections of equity to keep them going?

Mr ABETZ - That's the important point isn't it; that as shareholder ministers - and I don't think any Tasmanian, irrespective of the hue of the government that might be in place, would ever allow TT-Line to fail.

CHAIR - That's not the question.

Mr ABETZ - No, but it's an underlying foundation. And if that is the underlying foundation, that no government irrespective of its hue would allow it to fail, it means that it will continue to be able to pay its debts because the government will ensure [Bookmark: Phr14_O=205.6_D=13.0_C=0.77]  that is the case.

CHAIR - How do you do that? How do you as government ensure they have the money to pay the debts? Not just this year as they have a bit of headroom in their borrowing at the moment, and they have $75 million which will tide them over for a short period. How do you ensure their solvency in the out years, because we're talking about this Budget here, which goes out to 2028-29. How do you claim that they'll be solvent in 2028-29?
Mr ABETZ - The government will monitor TT-Line on a regular basis, and as in this Budget, if there were a requirement of $74.5 million equity injection, that is what you do, if I can use the term, to 'keep the show afloat'. The board of directors - 

CHAIR - Isn't it likely that they'll need that in the years beyond just this year? 

Mr ABETZ - The board of directors, with each one of them highly qualified [Bookmark: Phr18_O=266.3_D=8.0_C=0.83]  and experienced, are very mindful of the consequences to them personally [Bookmark: Phr19_O=275.7_D=25.1_C=0.75]  if they were found to be running an insolvent company.

CHAIR - Treasurer, I'm asking you.

Mr ABETZ - No, you asked me whether I was satisfied that they were solvent, and sure, we have the Auditor-General, who found -

CHAIR - No, I asked you how you are going to maintain that solvency in 2026-27, 2027-28, and 2028-29, without any further allocation of funding to assist?

Mr ABETZ - When and as, if it is required. As I said, a government of any hue will make that capital injection -

CHAIR - How likely is that needed for TT-Line, in your view? Looking at their projects on foot, their capacity to increase revenues, and the value of the vessels.

Mr SWAIN - If I could just add a bit of process to this discussion? Treasury and TASCORP, which I wear another hat in relation to, will meet with TT-Line - I think we have not actually put it in place yet, but it will be during December - to go through where TT-Line has got to in terms of their capital review and financing review work that they've been progressing for two or three months. That will translate into ongoing discussions between TT-Line and TASCORP, as their lender, about what their lending limit is in the context of that report, and the $75 million of equity.

In relation to Treasury, Treasury is likely to give some advice - likely will give some advice to the government in the lead-up to the next Budget informed by those discussions. So, we haven't worked through that process and haven't yet given the Treasurer advice on that matter, but we fully intend to.

CHAIR - Looking at the work - project of TT-Line, is it likely that there will need to be further equity injections to keep TT-Line afloat - with every pun intended there?

Mr ABETZ - Look, I'm not going to speculate on that. Suffice to say we will monitor it, but can I go back to the original question? The full board of directors - they have a lot riding on their reputation and their future saleability in the marketplace. If they were trading in an insolvent company, there would be huge consequences for them personally. That said, just to make sure that they weren't misleading themselves, they have got independent advice as well, which has reassured them that their assessment is correct. And so, look, is the Auditor-General's commentary on this valuable? Yes, it is. But is it the be-all and end-all? With respect, no it's not, and what we - 

CHAIR - But it does rely on the government being willing to provide extra additional equity to enable them to continue to meet their commitments as and when they fall due, which is insolvent?

Mr ABETZ - And the government is willing, of course - as I said, a government of any political hue would be willing to do that which is necessary to keep the show going. The TT-Line board, new CEO, new management, and can I say, the outfit we have now running the TT-Line to that which was in place before - sort of chalk and cheese, I've got to say, and I'm sure -

CHAIR - There's no indication in your Budget here that it's likely that additional funding will be needed, because if it is, it's going to create another pressure on an already-stretched Budget, where we've seen other expenditure pushed out and an expectation of cutting a lot of employees from the public service.

Mr ABETZ - And they are, as a board and CEO, et cetera, looking at how they can run a more efficient enterprise, and so -

CHAIR - But their concern is not with the state Budget; that's your concern. I'm asking you as Treasurer. We can ask them in a week what they're doing about it. I'm asking you as Treasurer: if there's additional funding required, which is highly likely, additional equity transfer - and Mr Kanofski said himself that it would be - $75 million would last 12 to 18 months. The forward Estimates go a lot longer than that.

Mr ABETZ - But as a government looking at what might need to be put in, we are comforted by the fact that the board and the CEO and that management realise that they need to ensure that it becomes a more viable organisation, and, therefore, the demand on the state budget will be limited.

Mr SWAIN - Just a couple of points. There are a couple of timing considerations here that are important. When the Auditor-General responded to the requirement that he form a view on this matter, obviously the Budget hadn't been brought down, so he had no visibility of whether there would or wouldn't be anything in the Budget to deal with this matter, and when Treasury gave the Treasurer advice about the quantum of funding to put in for equity this year, we had imperfect information, because that capital financial evaluation process had begun but wasn't concluded. There was a provision recommended that the government adopted -

CHAIR - It may not be enough in the long term.

Mr SWAIN - We have recognised in the risks section on page 86 that the TT-line is a specific risk. Just to your point globally, if you think about TT-line's key capital items, its two ships are its biggest items and its berthings -

CHAIR - Two new ones.

Mr SWAIN - are the next biggest, so you have an entity that was recapitalising all its major capital items which -

CHAIR - Under the watch of this government.

Mr SWAIN - then had a well-discussed increase in costs, and a delay in additional revenue because of the delay with the boats, so it's not surprising that it is experiencing some financial challenges.

CHAIR - I'm just going to go to another area. Just going back to the point that you've talked about, Treasurer, in that you've had a compressed time frame for this Budget and so-called interim Budget. How has the compressed time frame affected the quality and rigour of the Budget development? What normal processes were truncated or omitted in its development?

Mr CRAIGIE - Well, the budget papers are a full set of budget papers. The government had the benefit of having a May Budget not passed, so there was a lot of work done. A normal budget process has a significantly longer time frame where you get agency submissions, presentations from agencies to the budget committee and then time for the budget committee and the Treasurer to look at those submissions and what's funded and not funded. That happened in the lead-up to the May Budget, but the election disrupted that.

CHAIR - Was that work fed into this Budget or was it redone? I'm asking you what was truncated about this process.

Mr CRAIGIE - No, that was not redone. We did not go back to agencies and ask for a new round of submissions. We leveraged off the work that was done. We did go back to agencies for risks and other updates, but not for budget submissions.

CHAIR - So the only part that was truncated, then, was -

Mr CRAIGIE - Well, there was a significantly shorter time frame and there is some, I guess, decay in the value of information from May.

Mr ABETZ - And the outcomes - there were all the outcomes within the annual reports tabled on 31 October -

CHAIR - But they're not included in the budget papers, I might add.

Mr ABETZ - No, no. They're not in the budget papers because the Budget was delivered after 31 October, so that was a truncation as well. The gender statement which was delivered with the May Budget was still relevant to the interim Budget -

CHAIR - You didn't mention that in your speech at all - the fact that it was still relevant. It just disappeared altogether.

Mr ABETZ - I could have banged on for an hour. I went for - what was it? 32 minutes and 5 seconds, I think I was told.

CHAIR - Wasn't it important enough to mention that we didn't redo it because it's still relevant?

Ms LOVELL - You could've gone to 35 minutes and mentioned it.

Mr ABETZ - Because it's still relevant, it remains relevant. I could have gone through a whole host of issues and said, 'This remains relevant, this remains relevant, this remains relevant.' If I didn't point out the obvious, that it remained relevant, then I apologise. It was like the key performance indicators. They're there on the public record.

CHAIR - I have another one for this line item, but Cassy, did you want one on this line item? I'm going to move on to 1.2 shortly.

Ms O'CONNOR - Sure. Well, I'm interested to know whether there's been any contact with government from credit rating agencies given that -

CHAIR - That's under a different line item. We will come to that - 1.3.

Ms O'CONNOR - Well, it's also budget development and management -

Mr ABETZ - I can try to answer that now. Yes, there has been. I've appeared before both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, as has Treasury -

Ms O'CONNOR - When was that, sorry?

Mr ABETZ - That would have been last month? Was it October?

Mr SWAIN - The most recent interaction was with Treasury.

Mr ABETZ - With Treasury, yes.

Mr SWAIN - Which was the day - I'm just trying to revisit - after the Budget, day before?

Mr SWAIN - The day before where we did presentations on the Budget to both Moody's and S&P and just walked them through what would be likely to be in the Budget.

Ms O'CONNOR - Was there any, and we will get to this, but was there any indication that they were looking to downgrade us further, given that we're the one state in the country that has a negative credit rating?

Mr SWAIN - Both were on -

Mr ABETZ - They were on negative watch.

CHAIR - None says negative in your budget papers.

Ms O'CONNOR - It says negative in the Budget.

Mr SWAIN - We're on negative watch with both S&P and Moody's, and they do have concerns in relation to the level of debt and the level of expenditure that is going to debt repayments. That is evident -

Ms O'CONNOR - And borrowing to pay for borrowings.

Mr SWAIN - That is evident in them putting the state on negative watch.
CHAIR - Can I just clarify that point, Cassy? Because in the 2024-25 Budget it was stable, and in the 2025-26 Budget it's negative. You say you're on negative watch, but the recording in the budget papers has gone from stable in 2024-25 to negative. So, you're saying that they're on negative watch with a negative rating? Is that what you're saying? Because that's what your budget papers say.

Ms O'CONNOR - But we are doubly negative.

Mr ABETZ - Yes.

CHAIR - So, we're already on negative?

Mr SWAIN - We're on negative watch. We are.

CHAIR - On negative watch, on negative? Correct?

Mr GOURLAY - I'm not sure what that terminology means, but we've got our rating and our outlook is negative.

Mr ABETZ - That's the state A2 [inaudible]

CHAIR - Right. So, we've got a negative rating with a negative outlook.

Mr SWAIN - There's only one negative.

Mr ABETZ - Two negatives make a positive, hah.

Ms O'CONNOR - Oh, I'm sure. Can I just ask, did you happen, Treasurer, to read the article in The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age a couple of weeks ago by journalist Shane Wright, who painted a really -

Mr ABETZ - Yes, by Shane Wright. Yes. Great headline -

Ms O'CONNOR - Well, it painted a really alarming picture of a state that's essentially on the brink of bankruptcy. I mean, there was some talk in the article of federal bailouts. I mean, how close to the reality is that assessment? We're now in the national media as a sort of nearly bankrupt state, and you want to build a multibillion dollar stadium? It just doesn't add up.

Mr ABETZ - Well, it comes back to the stadium.

Ms O'CONNOR - In many ways it does, because it's emblematic of your government's recklessness.

Mr ABETZ - Good luck to them. We then have other people saying killing the stadium will do little to fix the debt, which is an editorial, so -

Ms O'CONNOR - An editorial in the Mercury, which is -

CHAIR - No, that was in The Advocate. But he's right…

Mr ABETZ - No, in The Advocate. In the north-west, you see - the Chair's home territory.

Ms O'CONNOR - Okay, sure. The great economic analysis of The Advocate newspaper -

Mr ABETZ - It was an opinion. It was an opinion of Shane Wright and the Fairfax papers, who seem to have a particular view of the world, but I can assure you -

Ms O'CONNOR - Based on the numbers before them.

Mr ABETZ - But I can assure you that we are not in a position of needing a bailout. It was a cheap headline. Good luck to them, et cetera. But, if the federal government, in coming back to this - if they were to fund health as they had promised, things would be somewhat better.

Ms O'CONNOR - So, there's nearly $610 million allocated in this year's Budget towards the stadium. Shortfall in health is identified in the budget papers as being around $640 million. So, two quite similar numbers.

Mr ABETZ - It is spread out over a number of years over the forward Estimates, that amount, and I accept that. But on top of that, of course, if we don't go ahead, we miss out on the AFL's 360, just as an example.

Mr SWAIN - Can I just provide a bit of context? Just important that on Moody's and S&P, with the third- and second-highest rating possible in relation to S&P, we are the same as Queensland and New South Wales, and like all states and -

Ms O'CONNOR - Same what?

Mr ABETZ - Rating category.

Mr SWAIN - The same rating. And in relation to the broader context of securing debt, the states and territories are all supported by the AAA rating of the Commonwealth, which is one of nine in the world. You know, we're still - we are in the position of having a rating or ratings that are under pressure but offer a very strong starting point.

Ms O'CONNOR - Thank you.

Could I ask, Treasurer: if you accept the basic premise that to build a stadium funded by borrowings ultimately means service cuts, and that's what the Planning Commission has made really clear. So, it's about the choices that are manifest in this Budget - the blank lines in the out years, the underfunded agencies. Do you accept the basic reality that to build a stadium at public cost, apart from debt servicing costs, means that governments in the future will need to make choices, and those choices will lead to service cuts. 

Mr ABETZ - No, I don't. Any infrastructure project that we engage in will incur public expenditure. There's no doubt about that.

Ms O'CONNOR - At this scale, though?
Mr ABETZ - It will be an infrastructure project that will be an economic enabler. It will assist in a whole host of areas for our economy. It will provide confidence and self-esteem, and people will know that Tasmania is a place where you can invest. We will have at least one, if not two, new hotels being built on the back of stadium approval. It's those sorts of extra enablers that cannot be overlooked in all this.

Might I add that, in the forward Estimates, this year it's a relatively small amount, then there's next year, and it builds up to the big build. Do we ask those questions about the Brighton School or the Legana School or the Bridgewater - 

Ms O'CONNOR - The Bridgewater infrastructure, necessary critical infrastructure, versus a stadium; our third one? 

Mr ABETZ - As you well know, and all the experts have told you, that if you want the anchor tenet for the stadium, which makes it stack up - and the stadium is multipurpose, it will be of benefit for a whole range of activities - but you need an anchor tenant; the AFL has said quite clearly that either Bellerive or York Park cannot and will not be sufficient for an actual home base. 

Ms O'CONNOR - It's not the view of the AFL Task Force. Can I just ask the final question on this line of questioning, Chair? When the Tasmanian Planning Commission final report came out, based on a costing at that time estimated at $945 million, the Premier on that same day, I think, came back and said our new projected cost is $1.13 billion to construct the stadium. That's now a couple of months ago, and those costs will have risen. Have there been any new costings requested or undertaken so that Treasury and you, as Treasurer, have a more realistic picture of what it might cost to construct our third stadium? 

Mr ABETZ - You should be asking that later this afternoon with the Macquarie Point Development, but -

Ms O'CONNOR - You're the Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - I'm aware of that. Thank you for reminding me. That's very helpful. 

Ms O'CONNOR - Why would we ask a GBE?

Mr ABETZ - Because they're the ones that have done the costings that were then provided to government. 

Ms O'CONNOR - And the last ones for $1.13 billion, were they?

Mr ABETZ - That's right, and there is contingency built into that. They've also indicated the cost of delaying the project; how that has and will continue to increase the cost, but that has now been, with contingency, factored in. These things are never absolutely certain, like the building of a bridge or a school - 

Ms O'CONNOR - It is certain that the cost of it will increase. 

Mr ABETZ - Well, that's your assertion, and time will tell.

Ms O'CONNOR - No, it's just rational.

Ms THOMAS - On the same topic; as Treasurer, as part of the budget development process, did you ask Treasury to model the renewal costs and operating subsidies that would result from adding a new stadium to the government's balance sheet?

 Whether it's sitting on the balance sheet of the Macquarie Point Development Corporation, or Stadiums Tasmania, wherever the asset sits, there will be ongoing operating costs, and likely subsidies required by the government to meet those costs. Have you asked Treasury to model those, and where are they included in the forward Estimates? 

Mr ABETZ - That's a fair question, and that is something with every infrastructure project, maintenance costs, et cetera. It's interesting that it seems that it's only for the stadium that those sort of extra costs -

Ms THOMAS - With respect, Treasurer, we're not usually asked to make planning decisions on other significant infrastructure projects, so that's why we're asking.

Mr ABETZ - It's not the planning. The planning is one issue. Economic viability, with respect, is another issue, but I'll pass to the secretary.

Mr SWAIN - I've just got a couple of comments. In relation to the capital costs, Treasury is involved in an oversight steering committee which keeps abreast of where Macquarie Point is at in terms of its capital delivery. The next major point, which you'll probably hear this afternoon would be when they go to market and test the market.

With a background in capital delivery, you can have an improving view on capital cost as you work through scoping and development, but your key point is when you go to the market and see what people will contract for and to deliver.

Ms THOMAS - I had moved on from capital cost. They were the member for Hobart's questions. I was talking about operating and the subsidies required by the government ongoing.

Mr SWAIN - In relation to operating costs, they are outside of the forward Estimates and, no, we haven't done detailed modelling on that. We have in relation to a request from Mr Bayley, done a little bit of work for the Treasurer in relation to future interest rate costs, but we haven't done modelling on the site.

CHAIR - Do you intend to do that?

Ms THOMAS - Treasurer, do you think that is something you ought to be asking Treasury to model? So that you, as Treasurer, have a full understanding of the impact on the budget of the ongoing operations of this proposed stadium?

Mr ABETZ - Those sorts of costs are something I dare say would be, I'm just trying to think this out, whether MPDC would be better or Stadiums Tasmania might be better because they have an understanding of what actual costs might be involved being the operators of stadia.

Mr SWAIN - It is similar to the corporate planning process I described earlier. The responsible entity would do that planning work and then Treasury may be asked to review it.
Mr ABETZ - That's what I thought.

Ms THOMAS - But as Treasurer, you accept that there will likely be a need for ongoing subsidies to Stadiums Tasmania, Macquarie Point Development Corporation, wherever the asset sits to fund the ongoing operations and renewal of the asset, noting that Stadiums Tasmania doesn't have significant revenue streams to cover that.

Mr ABETZ - There will clearly be costs as when you build a new road, guess what, if they've got maintenance costs over the years to fill potholes do weed reductions and so, that is part and parcel of doing normal business.

Ms THOMAS - You will need revenue streams coming in to pay for those.

CHAIR - Roads don't have other operating costs though. They don't have power bills; they don't have grass growing requirements. There's a whole heap of things that are different from a stadium than a road.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, but as as Stadiums Tasmania and MPDC are of the view that those costs are all part and parcel of the operations that will be recovered.

Ms THOMAS - Do you accept there will be likely ongoing equity injections required from the government to fund the operating and renewal costs of the stadium?

Mr ABETZ - There will be, how they will be funded is the question, and then the question is the extent of it. It is like when you build a new road, there will be the ongoing costs of different maintenance of that road or if you build a school when it needs a new lick of paint or whatever, there are always ongoing costs.

Ms THOMAS - You always have to be sure as a government. Do you accept you need to be able to have sufficient revenue coming in to fund those essential services?

Mr ABETZ - You need sufficient room in the budget to be able to do it, yes.

CHAIR - Before we move on to 1.2, I just wanted to take you to the last page in the budget paper 1, which is the general government expenses from the transaction by purpose. I note in this that health expenditure is only planned to increase by 5.6 per cent by 2028-29.

But when we look at the risk sections in the same budget paper, it states that increases in demand for and costs for health activity in recent years has resolved in most states and territories, including Tasmania, because this compares across the country, clearly exceeding the 6.5 per cent growth cap, while education expenditure is expected to increase by 8.8 per cent and general public services expenditure by a large 38 per cent.

What is the reason for this significant increase in expenditure on general public services, particularly in 2026-27?

Mr ABETZ - From 657 to 919 - that's what you're referring to?

CHAIR - Yes, that one first.

Mr SWAIN - That's the catch-all category that picks up everything that's not in one of the others. I think we would have to take that on notice and come back to you.

CHAIR - So we can have a breakdown and to be clear on what we're asking for, under the general public services section or line item there, what various expenses by transactions by purpose drive that change?

If you go to the health, as I said, it only predicts an increase of 6.5 per cent when the risk section sort of suggests increasing pressures on health. Even if it were just the cap percentage that was used, this would suggest that health expenditure is expected to grow by 26 per cent over the Budget and forward Estimates period.

How can the budget Estimates have any credibility if there's a gap of 20 per cent between the likely health expenditure and what the government is saying it will spend on health services?

Ms O'CONNOR - Exactly. It's what we've been trying to get to the bottom of.

Mr SWAIN - James has just reminded me, Treasurer, that part of the reason on the health numbers is that those numbers were prepared on the same policy basis. It doesn't factor in potential outcomes from the current health agreement negotiation. You would expect - we will certainly be pushing for - an improvement in the state and Commonwealth's contribution, but because it's not certain, it's not baked in.

CHAIR - We have talked about needing to right-size the public service. Does this suggest then that health is going to have to take a severe haircut to meet the expectations outside of the Australian Government funding situation?

Mr SWAIN - Again, mathematically, health is just over a third of the state's budget. If there is budget improvement required, health will have to make a contribution.

CHAIR - Does that mean that we're talking about frontline services?

Mr ABETZ - The government's been clear on that.

CHAIR - What's the government's position on that?

Mr ABETZ - That frontline services will be maintained.

CHAIR - When we look at the proportion of workers who work on the frontline in health, what is the percentage of frontline workers, nurses, doctors, cleaners, ward clerks, all the people who make a hospital run, all of those across the health department - what is the proportion of those who would be frontline services?

Mr ABETZ - With respect, you should be asking the health department and health Estimates as to the detail of that. I did seek to read out before some of the savings that health thought would be able to be made, which included -

CHAIR - I have that list. I don't need you to repeat that. What are the expected savings from those measures?
Mr ABETZ - It included reviewing and standardising rostering practices to decrease overtime and agency staff and costs.

CHAIR - That's been a long-going battle for some time -

Mr ABETZ - Yes, it has.

CHAIR - and mostly related to the doctors because there is electronic rostering for others. It's mostly the doctors where that sits.

Mr ABETZ - I'm not sure -

CHAIR - Well their industrial agreement prevented that from being adopted at one stage.

Mr ABETZ - there's electronic rostering for nurses. Anyway, ask health for that.

CHAIR - Anyway, aside from that, what is the expected - you have this list - savings from those measures?

Mr ABETZ - Look, they haven't been, as I'm aware, individually assessed.

CHAIR - You don't have a high-level figure though that would be looking at what this could probably achieve?

Mr ABETZ - Not from my perspective, but health.

Ms O'CONNOR - Can I ask on the service cuts?

Treasurer, are you able to outline to the committee how many FTE positions last financial year and this financial year today have been subject to recruitment freezes, targeted negotiated voluntary redundancies, any other form of redundancies and any other vacancy management or workforce renewal initiatives resulting in positions being eliminated or unfilled? Does Treasury have that sort of holistic list across agencies? 

Mr SWAIN - We have some of that information, but I was just saying to the Treasurer, is that a matter for the Premier to answer? You will have his SSMO, who will be effectively the source of truth on the numbers. We talk to SSMO and reconcile the numbers between the budget branch and SSMO, but SSMO is the source of truth on those numbers. It might be better - 

Ms O'CONNOR - There are no numbers that you'd be prepared to provide for us now? Obviously, the opportunity is to ask the Premier in other committees, just for some sort of colour around this scenario.

Mr CRAIGIE - Treasurer, through you, I've got a response to the general purpose. To your question around the increase in general public services, the increase in 2026-27 is $262 million: that's made up of a $106 million increase in finance general-debt servicing costs output and $169 million increase in finance general-local government grants output. If I refer you to page 79 of BP2 volume 1, which is the finance general chapter.

Under table 5.5 administered expenses, the third line item, local government grants, jumps significantly from 2025-26 to 2026-27. That's predominantly due to the timing of when the Commonwealth pays those grants. We budget for them on an annual basis, but they often, in a financial year, will bring forward a half-yearly payment and pay it. We get sort of two payments in a year. That's why that forward estimate is so much higher, and then it reverts back to a normal time, a normal - 

CHAIR - The reverting back then, if I might, Treasurer, it's still higher, obviously, but that continues the debt repayment. 

Mr CRAIGIE - The debt cost is forecast to go up across the four estimates. That drives the general upward trend - 

CHAIR - The underlying rise, yes. 

Mr CRAIGIE - but the reason for the significant blip is the timing of the local government grants.

CHAIR - Thanks for that. We won't need to put it on notice. 

Mr SWAIN - I've got a number for change from June 2025 to September 2025, which is for GGS, which is from $33,542 to $33,601, so 59. 

Ms O'CONNOR - June to September, this year?

Mr SWAIN - Yes, the employment freeze started in March, I think, I don't have that number to hand.

Ms O'CONNOR - Is that 59 targeted, negotiated voluntary redundancies?

Mr SWAIN - No, that's the change in FTEs in that time frame. It's very low. 

Ms O'CONNOR - Fifty-nine FTEs less over three months?

Mr SWAIN - There's been one WRIP that I'm aware of in another agency. 

CHAIR - Which stands for? 

Mr ABETZ - Workforce renewal incentive program.

Mr SWAIN - Workforce renewal incentive program. Thank you, it just took me a moment. I have some additional information we were able to find during the break in another folder. It may be of interest, just more broadly: the GGS FTE numbers at June, 2015 were 23,671 which have moved to June 2025, 33,359. 

CHAIR - What were they in 2019? 

Mr SWAIN - In 2019, I don't have that number. I have 2021, which is 28,000. 

CHAIR - I want the number just before COVID. 
Mr SWAIN - Sorry, I haven't got - 

CHAIR - Can you get that figure?

Ms O'CONNOR - June 25 was - 

Mr SWAIN - We could get that figure, but I haven't got it now. 

CHAIR - We're going to take a short break. I wonder if you might be able to come back with that figure, but that is the relevant figure that we should be looking at. 

Ms O'CONNOR - Which one?

CHAIR - Just before COVID. 

Ms O'CONNOR - Just for clarity, between 2015, so within that 10-year period of time, FTEs in the general government sector went from 26,000 - 

CHAIR - No, 23. 

Mr SWAIN - 23,671.

Ms O'CONNOR - To June 2025 - 

Mr SWAIN - To 33,359.

I think when we are able to get you that pre-COVID year, I think what it will say is there has been significant growth, particularly since COVID. What we're talking about, in relation to 2800 is returning back to that pre-growth number. But we will get that number. 

CHAIR - If it's possible to get every number, so that there is 2016-17, 2018-19, and then subsequent to COVID. 

Mr SWAIN - Yes. Sorry, Chair, my only nervousness, if I can put it on the record, is that the numbers I've got are GGS, whereas the SSMO numbers will actually be slightly different, because they will have things like police, who are not in the GGS. If there are differences in our numbers to SSMOs, that will be why. It's a definitional thing. 

CHAIR - Ok, thank you. We'll take a break for 15 minutes and we will come back and go into item 1.2, of which we've touched on some areas, like financial management and accounting service, but there are some other matters in that line item that I'd like to pursue. 

The committee suspended from 11.01 a.m. to 11.18 a.m.

CHAIR - Thanks, Treasurer. I think you've got some answers to questions that you've taken on notice.

Mr ABETZ - Yes. Look, if I may, in relation to the member for Elwick and election promises - I, in fact, read something into the Hansard in the other place the other day which said:
We are working through the varying complexities of each of our commitments, but as the Premier outlined to the House this morning, we are committed to delivering our election obligations and are willing to engage and work with each of our stakeholders on how we will meet our commitments.

It will be on a case-by-case basis that we will be discussing the commitments. In relation to -

Ms THOMAS - My questions on notice still stand, though.

Mr ABETZ - Alright. In relation to the member for Elwick, in relation to operational costs, Stadiums Tasmania has indicated that it is of the view that the operational side will be self-funded. It will be the maintenance issue that you refer to, which is still on notice.

The member for Hobart asked about the extra costs on the stadium and gave us a list of things. If I may quickly - the northern access road; I've dealt with the car park. It is not required for the operation of the stadium. The event buses - and I've dealt with that in the other place - is $49 million that has been asserted. That is very questionable because it's allocating the full cost of uplifting the school bus fleet to disability compliance standards in full, and allocating that to the cost of the stadium is, with respect, unreasonable.

The TSO funding is already in the 1.13 figure.

The footpath widening - no changes to Davey or Collins Street are required from our pedestrian modelling to service that.

Then, coming to the numbers of public servants - paid FTEs, general government sector:
2015: 23,671,
2016: 24,297,
2017: 25,016,
2018: 26,100,
2019: 26,970,
2020: 27,727.

I think I was asked about redundancies as well -

Ms O'CONNOR - Yes, by category.

Mr ABETZ - Oh, by category. I can't - no, I don't have - I'll keep taking that on notice.

The targeted and negotiated voluntary redundancies:
2022-23 were 14,
2023-24: 21,
2024-25: there were 3.

Workforce Renewal Incentive Program:
2022-23 were 16,
2023-24: 9,
2024-25: 8.

I think that is it. Thanks, Chair.

Output Group 1 - Financial and Resource Management Services
1.2 Financial Management and Accounting Services

CHAIR - Okay, we'll go to line item 1.2, 'Financial Management and Accounting'. 

Treasurer, I do note that this covers funding for the public account reporting and management system. How much has been expended on this system to date?

I'll also ask what the total estimated cost is, because they're going to be in the same brief, I imagine.

Mr SWAIN - The total funded projected is $7.57 million being funded through the government's Digital Transformation Priority Expenditure Program.

What I'm just looking for is the spend to date. Sorry, here we go. Up to 30 September 2025, $770,000 has been spent from the project, primarily relating to salaries and consultant costs.

CHAIR - And what progress has actually been made, then, on it?

Mr CRAIGIE - Through you, Treasurer: There have been a few delays to the development of the project, as other priorities have pushed the project out. The rollout of e-invoicing required work to the base finance system - we had to move to a new version of our finance system that was web-enabled to enable e-invoicing. So, there are a couple of projects that have forced that one to be deferred a bit.

CHAIR - Is the $770,000 to date covered those changes, or are they additional costs?

Mr CRAIGIE - It would probably be a mixture.

CHAIR - Okay. Has there been any progress on the development of the actual system now?

Mr CRAIGIE - Absolutely. There's a detailed project specification, and the project is now - with those other two smaller projects completing - is now back to being the primary project and we're anticipating a procurement in the coming 12 months.

CHAIR - When do you expect it to be operational?

Mr CRAIGIE - I haven't got that date in front of me. It depended on the procurement process finding a supplier and the timeline on that. It is a significant project in a Treasury context. As you're aware, we've updated our budget information management system, and this is the actual system. It's a significant project.

Mr ABETZ - Completion in 2029, I'm being told here.

CHAIR - When do you expect it to be operational?

Mr ABETZ - A procurement is planned to go to market in 2026, with the project estimated for completion in 2029.

CHAIR - In the Budget, the total Estimates cost the secretary alluded to is $7.57 million. We know how these things blow out. Is that a realistic figure?

Mr ABETZ - To the best of my advice at the moment, yes, but I heed your warning and experience on these things.

CHAIR - With other changes that need to be made, do we have a total cost on those that needed to happen before this could start? You've said some of it's in the $770,000, but obviously they would have cost more than that.

Mr CRAIGIE - I think we should be able to get those costs.

CHAIR - If it's available now, I can come back to that if you want.

Mr SWAIN - I've just been advised that the 770 is just Paramus. We haven't a briefing on those projects that have completed, but we can get that information.

CHAIR - The 770 is entirely related to Paramus or whatever we are calling it these days?

Mr CRAIGIE - Paramus, yes.

CHAIR - This area covers assessment of risks and associated risk mitigation strategies and the preparation of whole-of-government financial and statistical reports. If I can take you to budget paper 1, page 74 to78, specifically table 4.1 on page 76.

Can you talk about the risks associated with some of the revenues on page 76: 

State taxation revenue estimates are sensitive to changes in a range of economic parameters, such as employment, wages growth, interest rates and inflation.

A bit further on, when it talks about some of our tax bases like land tax and payroll tax and how they are less volatile than conveyance duty;

For example, a decrease in land value on the back of a weakened property market may impact future land tax receipts.

There's also commentary throughout this section of some of the global pressures and we all understand some of those. We don't understand them, but we observe them - some of them.

I'm interested in Treasury's view of our current tax base. You've committed to not introduce any new taxes, but is our tax base sound or are we likely to see deterioration in the revenues we get from that? I notice when we look at say mineral royalties, for example, that's completely flat. There was no predicted increase in that, which is surprising to me. For example, why is that? Because that's one of our ways of raising revenue.
Ms O'CONNOR - If only we charged what the national average for mining royalties -

CHAIR - That's not the question.

Ms O'CONNOR - I know, but it's an observation.

CHAIR - Let's not get distracted by it. How sound do you think it is and why we're not seeing perhaps projections for changes to that in terms of the amount - not the change to the method, but changes to the amount.

Mr SWAIN - I am looking at my colleague Dean who may have something to add. The mineral royalty testaments, I believe, come from State Growth based on a sort of detailed view, mine-by-mine. So, I don't think I can add much to that.

The general comment I would make, as someone who's been getting across budget matters with some speed in the last 21 months, is that the revenue forecast from Treasury on the tax outcomes are generally very close between the actuals and budgets, so the revenue side tends to be more predictable, with some challenges specifically to the GST revenue particularly driven by pool.

I can't answer your question specifically on mineral royalties, but what I've observed over the last three budgets, one of which didn't proceed, is the overs and unders tend to leave you with a very accurate overall tax outcome to what's predicted. The swing item in the revenue other than GST then becomes the capital payments from the Commonwealth, which come out year-by-year and come in as revenue. They are a little pessimistic in the budget, but don't think there's any fair way to represent them otherwise, because you would simply be guessing about what the Commonwealth might do.

CHAIR - That's in relation to the Commonwealth payments, but I'm talking about our own state tax office.

Mr SWAIN - Yes, sorry. I'm sorry, I was talking to revenue more generally.

The state tax revenue has seemed quite accurate with GST the swing. As you know, capital grants come in as revenue into the budget, but they tend to come in year-by-year as the Commonwealth does their budget, so they look like they fall away through the forward Estimates more than they actually end up doing, is my observation.

I may not have answered your question, Chair. I'm not sure, sorry.

CHAIR - No. We don't know, so we'll ask Tas State Growth about why that might be the case, and we haven't got the right minister.

Looking at the expenditure risk - and this is what you've said is the biggest lever that we can pull - a couple of things I want to talk about is the workers compensation cost and liability pressures. This[inaudible] participant contributions to the personal injury risk category for 2025-26 have increased to $173.5 million, compared to $146.8 million for 2024-25 - that's a fair jump - prompting a significant funding allocation.

I will link that one then just to the next pressure that is the public sector wage outcomes, where your budget, Treasurer, provides for a wage indexation of 2.5 per cent, whereas the most - it says in the budget papers here: in September 2025, the Tasmanian government offered a one-year rollover agreement with a 3 per cent salary increase to cover 16 State Service wage agreements. They haven't been agreed yet, but that's still 0.5 per cent higher than what is presumed in this Budget.

We have that pressure that's inherent in the Budget. There is a significant increase in personal injury risk, and we're seeing the actuary has identified that as a major risk to the Budget. We see people being asked to do things with less, and the pressures on workers. How are you going to manage this without blowing out the workers compensation challenge, cut staff, and not pay them what they're due?

Mr ABETZ - Well, we would argue that 3 per cent is an appropriate -

CHAIR - But you're saying 2.5. Your Budget is premised on a 2.5 per cent increase. That's the point.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, and the departments and agencies will need to find those savings within their allocations, that extra 0.5.

CHAIR - Treasurer, the Budget is premised on 2.5. The figures in your Budget that feed into it are based on a 2.5 per cent increase.

Ms LOVELL - So the agencies will need to find the extra 0.5 for the wage offer that's on the table?

Mr ABETZ - Yes, that's it.

CHAIR - When you think about some of the agencies that have a huge staff component - health, education, well most of them really - how are they going to achieve that without cutting staff?

Mr ABETZ - We have been talking about rightsizing the public service, and we've already discussed the figure this morning of 2800. So, there will be a reduction in the size of the public service over the forward Estimates.

Ms LOVELL - Can I ask a follow up on that?

CHAIR - Yes, sure.

Ms LOVELL - Is 2800 the number of jobs required to find that additional 0.5 across agencies? What modelling have you got?

Mr SWAIN - There's two different things. As to the 2.5, there being an implicit efficiency dividend in the Budget is not a new feature for this Budget. It's been there for a couple of years at least.

CHAIR - It makes it harder and harder to achieve. 

Mr SWAIN - I was just going to note that no agency ever has all its positions filled at any one point in time, so, in effect, and as I said before, in Treasury's case, the current turnover is about 12 per cent, so there is a natural salary saving from just churn of staff.

CHAIR - Is that how Treasury saved money this year? 

Mr SWAIN - All agencies will use those funds to meet their global obligations and move them around under FMA or otherwise, so this is not related to the 2800; this is an existing efficiency measure that's been in the last two or three budgets, but noting that no agency ever has 100 per cent of its staff employed. 

Ms THOMAS - So that 0.5 additional that's required to be found saving to allow for the 3 per cent wage offer, that's not part of an existing efficiency measure, that's a new one in this Budget, is that right?

Mr SWAIN - No, I'm saying that it is an existing one. It was 2.5 last year as well, with a salary increase that was in the EBA of three. So this has been in the budget for two or three years.

Ms THOMAS - But if the increase of 3 per cent is agreed, there will need to be another 0.5 per cent saving found to fund it?

Mr SWAIN - Yes, but I'm saying that in practice no agency ever has 100 per cent establishment, and turnover will range between, I suspect, about 11 or 12 per cent to about 16 or 17 per cent. Those are the numbers I have seen previously. 

Ms LOVELL - It's not necessarily a good thing that they're not at 100 per cent establishment, though. There's a number of agencies that would argue that that means they're under-staffed. 

Mr SWAIN - Through you, Treasurer, the only way you could be at 100 per cent is if you plan to over-recruit, because you'd have to anticipate people's movements. You would have to recruit at 105 per cent of establishment, which you can't do because you haven't got the funding to do that. It's a feature of our system.

The only other comment I would make, though, is that I did go back - because I'm on the committee that supports the subcommittee of Cabinet that's involved in the wage negotiation - 

Mr ABETZ - Is that called PSIRC, or something?

Mr SWAIN - PSIRC, which is SSMO-led, and the Premier is the Chair of that subcommittee Cabinet; but a wage outcome with a '3' in front of it is actually a feature of the last EBA. If you go back over the decade or so before, the numbers have generally started with a '2'. 

Ms THOMAS - So if 3 per cent was on the table, why wasn't 3 per cent budgeted for? 

CHAIR - That's a question for the Treasurer. It's a policy question.

Ms THOMAS - If 3 per cent is the offer that's been made to the public sector, why was only a 2.5 per cent increase included in the Budget?

Mr ABETZ - Because that will be part and parcel of the task of the budget repair.

Ms THOMAS - But you've budgeted for something that is different to the policy position of the government.

Mr ABETZ - The various agencies will need to make the appropriate adjustments to be able to deal with anything above 2.5 per cent.

Ms THOMAS - That's not answering my question, Treasurer, because the government has put on the table an offer of 3 per cent. When you've put on the table an offer of 3 per cent, it's very unlikely that they're gonna say, 'Actually we only want 2.5', but what you've put in the Budget provides for a 2.5 per cent increase only. How do you explain that that's genuine budgeting?

Mr ABETZ - Because of the need for budget repair in the various agencies and departments.

Ms THOMAS - That's not a genuine way of asking them to do that. By saying we're going to offer 3 per cent, but budgeting only for 2.5 per cent increase, that's not 'asking' agencies to find a saving. 

Mr SWAIN - You could achieve that saving, as I described, through a process if you haven't got your establishment fully funded in one time, but also through efficiency by employing less people. You can have a 3 per cent increase as an agency that is delivered by having increased efficiency that requires you to employ less people.

Ms LOVELL - Which impacts on your service delivery, obviously. That's the point, I think.

Ms THOMAS - When all the departments have needed a budget supplementary appropriation, or a lot of them have in past years anyway, it's not a realistic expectation. 

Mr ABETZ - But you see, if we want all departments to be funded to the extent you're suggesting, how on earth do we get onto the pathway of budget repair? 

Ms THOMAS - That's not what I'm suggesting. I think there need to be policy decisions made to provide direction to departments about what services are going to be changed, and that's what the departments aren't receiving from the government. I haven't heard any from you about that direction. 

Mr ABETZ - All the departments have received in March of this year - was it not, from the Premier? - about recruitment - that there should be a freeze on non-essentials and regrettably the number has still increased and so there will be a lot stronger initiatives.

Ms THOMAS - It's one thing for the government to say you need to cut staff, but if I'm in a department, I'd be saying, well, what do you want me not to do then? That's a policy decision for the government and that's what we're seeing a total absence of. What policy decisions are you making to give that direction to agencies as to what you want them to stop doing?

Mr ABETZ - And it is those discussions that are taking place, as we speak, in anticipation of the May Budget. I'll have more to say when we enter the May Budget.

Ms THOMAS - But in the meantime, they've just got to cut staff. 

Mr ABETZ - We are working towards that and yes, they will - the rightsizing of the public service - if I might say - should have started a bit earlier after the Premier's direction.

Nevertheless, we are rightsizing the public service and that's the policy decision. Given that it takes up so much of our expenditure, it's only right and proper that that be looked at and each agency and department will need to see how they can deal with that. 

Ms THOMAS - But effectively what the government is allowing is for the public service to make the policy decisions about what they stop doing because the government is not providing that direction. The public service is being allowed to make those decisions. 

Mr ABETZ - No, no, what we will be doing is discussing these matters with the public service and each individual minister will undoubtedly be in discussions with his/her/their secretary or agency head to determine the rightsizing and how that might be undertaken and once that is done, that will then ultimately come up to Cabinet for a Cabinet decision.

Ms LOVELL - It's that term rightsizing the public service - I think it's fairly subjective and there are a couple of ways you could look at it. You could talk about rightsizing to have the right size public service to deliver the services that are needed by the community, or you could have rightsizing to make it the right size to fit the Budget. What's the driving motivation or angle - which angle are you expecting agencies to approach that from - is it about service delivery or is it about fitting the budget?

Mr ABETZ - Well, it's both. I've noted that - 

Ms LOVELL - It can't be both, really. 

Mr ABETZ - It can be, that a department can have a look at what were our numbers prior to COVID, what are they now? What are the extra things we've taken on since COVID that weren't being done before COVID, for example, or are there other projects that we've been involved in that have, sort of, run their course and might be able to no longer be considered as a priority. All those detailed discussions will take place with the various secretaries and heads of agency and then ultimately a cabinet will need to make a determination on those considerations. 

As the secretary indicated to us, the right size of the public service was the number of public servants per 100,000 of population. When you have a look at that prior to COVID to where it is now, I think we can be all agreed objectively that that has changed considerably, and our aim is, given the size of the public service costs to the Budget, to try to bring that back to that - what do we call it, a ratio? - 

Mr SWAIN - Yes. 
Mr ABETZ - Yes, a ratio. 

Ms LOVELL - What's that ratio based on? I understand the numbers. Is it based on that's the number of public servants required to deliver the services for that size of population or is it about the income the government receives, the revenue that you received from that number of population and that can afford to pay for that many public servants? How is that calculated?

Mr SWAIN - It predates me, but you could argue it was a little bit generous as a kind of productivity expectation because it was on the other side of COVID where there'd already been quite a lot of growth because it comes off the 2022-23 year. It was really a point-in-time metric, if you like, that said there isn't a lot of headroom in the government to afford a higher ratio of public servants to population, so we need to start tracking that and that's what was brought in the fiscal strategies, I understand.

Ms LOVELL - It's about budget, is that the revenue from that number? I don't understand why 100,000? Where does the ratio come from? I'm sorry, I assumed it might be a metric that's used across the country or something.

Mr SWAIN - No, it wasn't.

Ms LOVELL - Why was it 100,000? We're using a ratio to make a big decision about the budget. It would be good to understand where it comes from.

Mr SWAIN - As you'd be aware productivity has been a challenge for Australia across public and private, but it was effectively saying that unless there is a significant shift in the population, there shouldn't really be a need for a public sector that is very different to that when the fiscal strategy was arrived at. I think that was the basis of it.

Ms LOVELL - Does that take into account things like our population is ageing and the services that people might require are changing over that time in terms of our demographics in Tasmania and population growth and who's coming in and out of the state?

Mr ABETZ - I can indicate over recent years the number of GGSFTEs has increased significantly. Total GGSFTEs increased by 40.9 per cent over the past 10 years, 30 June 2015 to 30 June 2025. In comparison, over the same period, Tasmania's population increased by an estimated 11.9 per cent. The population increased by 11.9 and public service increased by 40.9. I think we can be agreed on those figures that some rightsizing is required.

Ms LOVELL - No, not necessarily. That doesn't really answer the question. My question was about demographics -

Mr ABETZ - All the demographics are there that the population -

Ms LOVELL - But that doesn't tell me anything about the makeup of that population. My question was specifically about whether this ratio or metric takes into account the changes in demographics over time and the fact we have an ageing population that will require more services.

Ms O'CONNOR - Highest chronic disease burden in the country.

Ms LOVELL - Highest chronic disease.

Mr ABETZ - In aged and health care which is, dare I remind you -

Ms LOVELL - No, let's not go back there.

Mr ABETZ - You don't want to hear that's a federal accessibility, and that's why we need more money.

Ms LOVELL - With respect, we've heard that a number of times and that's nothing to do actually with my question, which is about you're talking about public services that are provided by Tasmania. I am not talking about aged care or those things. I am talking about all the other public services that people rely on, which typically older populations will require more services, people with more chronic disease will require more services.

My question is whether that modelling is taken into account in this modelling using this metric which you're relying on to make very big decisions about the size of the public service and the budget.

Mr SWAIN - I have just been reminded that it is one of 11 measures. All 11 measures are meant to give you a picture of fiscal health.

CHAIR - All going the wrong way.

Mr SWAIN - The other other thing that is important is, under the PEFO projection, for example, more and more money is spent providing for interest on debt, which means all else being equal, there will be less public servants. In the default world of not improving the budget, there are also less public servants because the funding that could have gone to funding salaries is going to interest in that scenario.

Ms LOVELL - Which comes back to the question I was asking before about whether it's about rightsizing to fit the budget or rightsizing to fit the need of the community?

Mr SWAIN - Well, I'm just making point that -

Ms LOVELL - I'm agreeing with you. I understand.

Mr SWAIN - If you don't address the budget, you will end in the same scenario anyway of having to have less people.

Ms LOVELL - Yes, I understand that. Back to my question around that modelling on that metric, does that take into account the demographics of the population and how that's changing over time?

Mr SWAIN - It predates me, so I can't really answer that. I don't think it was coming from that angle. I think it was more going as one of 11 measures. We need to see if the public service looks like it is growing more rapidly than what can be afforded. I think that's what it was trying to assist.

Ms LOVELL - Yes, Okay. So, it's more about the size of the budget than the needs of the population.

Ms O'CONNOR - Back to something - through you, Treasurer - that Mr Swain said, and it confirms what we've been arguing. Mr Swain said there'll be more and more money required to service interest costs and that means, I'm paraphrasing here, there'll be less public servants. It is confirmed that there's a connection between profligate spending, borrowing to cover debt servicing and an erosion of public services.

Your government can say, we will leave the frontline alone - there's never been an adequate definition of what the frontline in service delivery is - but what we've just had confirmed is because of profligate spending and the debt that accrues and what we have to borrow to pay our interest payments, there'll be less public services.

In that context, can't you see how incredibly irresponsible it is to load another $1.8 billion at least to the state's debt over the next 10 years because you want to build this stadium we don't need? 

Mr ABETZ - You have put all your provocative language into that question - 

Ms O'CONNOR - You're welcome.

Mr ABETZ - Which I will try to avoid.

CHAIR - Or respond to but just answer the question if you could.

Mr ABETZ - Exactly. Albeit if the question allows it, the answer should allow it as well, Chair, but on this occasion, I will seek to restrain myself.

Ms LOVELL - Rise above it.

Mr ABETZ - I will seek to restrain myself. When a government borrows, if it borrows for something which is economically enabling, which also attracts $360 million from the AFL that if we if don't grab it, Darwin will or another team in Western Australia will. The federal funds of $240 million which is for the development of the precinct. if we don't go ahead with the stadium, there's no plan 'b' with that precinct.

CHAIR - That's irresponsible.

Mr ABETZ - Then-

Ms O'CONNOR - There is a plan 'b'; there was a master plan.

Mr ABETZ - The Eden Project, how could I have forgotten?

Ms O'CONNOR - How ridiculous. There is actually a Macquarie Point Master Plan, widely consulted with broad community input.

Mr ABETZ - There is the borrowing for your everyday needs, and there is borrowing that will assist in bringing other capital in like another hotel or two and provide a precinct which will be an attraction in its own right. Therefore, an economic enabler and cultural, et cetera enabler which cannot be overlooked. In the total Budget, in the total scheme of things and as was written in your local - no, not in your local newspaper - sorry, in the Chair's local newspaper:

killing the stadium will do little to fix our debt.

Will there be extra costs associated? Of course there will be, like with every other borrowing that the government undertakes.

Ms O'CONNOR - It is pretty lame to have to rely on an editorial in The Advocate to back up your argument to set the state into massive debt for a stadium we don't need.

CHAIR - That's a statement. Have you got another - 

Ms O'CONNOR - It's pathetic.

Mr ABETZ - That's a statement.

CHAIR - I am going to stop that. If there are specific questions, we've done the stadium to death, almost.

Ms O'CONNOR - We haven't, actually.

Ms THOMAS - You're not going to get the answers that you're looking for.

Ms O'CONNOR - We might, I want to talk about Homes Tasmania if we want to talk about a budget risk. Page 84 of budget paper 1, just as the PEFO did, identifies Homes Tasmania's growing debt burden which will be over a billion dollars by 30 June 2029 as a significant risk. Noting that, in this Budget, the papers state there is no specific equity contribution to Homes Tasmania. There is a specific equity contribution though towards the stadium.

Do you acknowledge that Homes Tasmania's financial situation is unsustainable? Do you acknowledge what the PEFO says about Homes Tasmania, estimating it will require extra funding of around $10 million a year, indexed to cover increasing unavoidable property-holding costs, this money is not accommodated for in the Budget as far as I can see it. Will the state be covering those equity cost requirements of Homes Tasmania? Just below that in the PEFO, Stadiums Tasmania indicates it'll require additional funding of around $11 million a year to operate and maintain its assets. If you had to choose - 

CHAIR - Answer the question about Homes Tasmania.

Ms O'CONNOR - Do you agree that the state is gong to have to cover Homes Tasmania's extra unavoidable costs and that they cannot afford to do that on borrowing or on the income that is generated from housing rents? 

Mr ABETZ - On page 102 of Budget Paper 2, Vol. 2, provided in the table that's there, the second-last line in the table, 'property holding costs: additional support', and you can see that increasing over the forward Estimates.
Ms O'CONNOR - Can Mr Swain or you tell us the source of that extra funding? Is it coming out of the rents generated by Homes Tasmania's property holdings?

Mr CRAIGIE - Homes Tasmania is a PNFC entity (Public Non-Financial Corporation), so PNFC entities aren't directly funded from the public account. In this case, that funding is appropriated to State Growth to provide as a grant to Homes Tasmania.

Ms O'CONNOR - It's a grant that is about half of what they suggested is required to cover their costs, and so can we assume that additional support for property-holding costs for Homes Tasmania will increase in the out years in order to meet the unavoidable costs that they've identified?

Mr ABETZ - Once again, that is hypothetical. 

Ms O'CONNOR - It's what they said they need.

CHAIR - I think we can ask this question of the Minister for Housing and Planning, because we'll have the Homes Tasmania people in front of us then.

Ms O'CONNOR - I know the decision ultimately rests with Cabinet, but for you, the Treasurer, this is a Public Non-Financial Corporation that to some extent you are responsible for. There's money going into a stadium and not really going into Homes Tasmania, and it's been saddled with debt.

Mr ABETZ - The reason that I am more able to talk about Macquarie Point as opposed to other elements of the Budget is that I also wear another hat as the minister responsible for the Macquarie Point Urban Renewal, and so I have more day-to-day knowledge of that as opposed to Homes Tasmania, and a whole host of other elements in the Budget. 

Ms O'CONNOR - Homes Tasmania's situation has been identified by Treasury as a future risk. You must be across that. Take an interest in and be concerned by that, and be thinking to the future how you're going to deal with it.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, and we have a very capable minister for housing, Mr Kerry Vincent, who serves in your place as the member for Prosser, and I'm sure he will be able to provide you with the detail as to how we've arrived at those figures.

Ms O'CONNOR - This will be my last question on this line of questioning. PEFO has identified Homes Tasmania as a risk. The model that it was set up under by legislation loads it up with debt and there will be interest repayments of $50 million a year within a few years. Do you agree that there are question marks, at best, over the sustainability of the financial model for Homes Tasmania? 

Mr ABETZ - I'm not going to answer that question 'yes' or 'no' as you would like me to. Suffice to say the government will always monitor these situations exceptionally carefully and take advice and watch that which is occurring. I'm sure that under the stewardship of Minister Vincent, Homes Tasmania will be looked after exceptionally well.

Ms O'CONNOR - You're sure of that.

Mr SWAIN - There is some work going on in that space, I believe, led by State Growth. 

Ms O'CONNOR - What space? The sustainability of the model?

Mr SWAIN - Yes, in relation to Homes Tasmania.

Ms O'CONNOR - It's almost as if they are set up to fail, Mr Swain.

Mr SWAIN - I was alluding to -

Ms O'CONNOR - The fact that it's being looked at.

Mr SWAIN - You may then want to ask questions about that.

CHAIR - You can ask questions on Thursday in relation to that. In terms of risks, which doesn't appear to have been - certainly not written about in any depth at all - what assessment has Treasury made for the financial and fiscal risk from climate change, including impacts on government businesses like Hydro Tasmania, particularly, and TasNetworks that are very influenced and affected by the weather?

Mr ABETZ - Storms.

CHAIR - Yes, but also rain, all the things that affect those two businesses particularly. In the modelling it shows what the impact of climate change has on them - those businesses on infrastructure development, emergency services and primary production. Has Treasury done modelling to look at those risks?

Mr SWAIN - Not explicitly. The hydrological risk is built into the energy security policy role that ReCFIT plays. Because of my background in infrastructure, I can say that what is happening in relation to infrastructure, generally, is that the standards for design and construction are increasingly taking those risks into account. From another life, bridge design has sort of moved from a one-in-200-year event to a one-in-1000-year event. I'm not sure if those numbers are quite right, but it's starting to be embedded in the design parameters for key infrastructure, greater climatic risk. The hydrological one will be ReCFIT as a security thing, and the general, 'Is your infrastructure adequate to deal with the climate that may emerge?' That should be embedded in standards, really, for design.

CHAIR - I would have thought that Treasury would have done some modelling about the potential cost of mitigation measures to be required by climate change. Obviously, there's infrastructure, there's energy, there're primary industries when we look at the rising temperature of our waters and things like that. There's a whole range of them. Does Treasury not do some modelling looking at all those things, potentially fed in through entities like ReCFIT and others such as your previous department? Does that not happen?

Mr SWAIN - Treasury is a relatively small agency, right? So we support the government of the day. I would say that the last 21 months we have had three budgets, two PEFOs, we're now in the middle of a fiscal sustainability report and we will also be developing a new fiscal strategy and supporting the Treasurer in terms of the multi-party budget repair panel, so we - 

CHAIR - I understand that, but I think climate change is not actually new. The impacts are being seen now that we've foreseen and been warned about for some time. Has Treasury not considered doing modelling specifically for these impacts?

Mr SWAIN - We have an entity called ReCFIT with climate change in its brief.

CHAIR - Across all areas or just energy? Because you sort of alluded to - the secretary alluded to, Treasurer, that that's related to the energy space and the hydrology, et cetera, but it doesn't necessarily relate to other infrastructure, impacts on health and the primary industries sector.

Mr BURGESS - I will probably make just one point: Treasury doesn't have, I guess, a comparative advantage in looking at these types of issues. Where that comparative advantage does reside is within ReCFIT and the Climate Change Office. They've done a lot of work in this regard and have developed a number of, what I think are called, resilience plans, which have been subject to consultation. They're meant to set out - taking into account likely climate change - what are the actions of government and industry to build resilience in that regard? I think that's the area you're probably best -

CHAIR - Do they model the associated costs?

Mr BURGESS - You'd have to ask them. I can't recall.

Ms O'CONNOR - Chair, I don't think any of the resilience plans are funded.

CHAIR - This is a question for the Treasurer. I can ask these questions of them too, but in terms of - obviously, these things are costly. Some of them are covered by insurance arrangements and support from the Australian Government. The major storm in the north-west is one of those, but that's later. In the absence of funding of costs, whose job is this to actually look at what is the potential cost involved with the resilience plan? It's just if you do this, that might prevent that, but there's a cost in doing that and there's also a cost in not doing it or not doing it well. Does no-one look at the cost?

Mr BURGESS - From my understanding, the resilience plan set out what actions you have to take to deal with climate change. The cost therefore is booked then into business cases and projects that are put forward into the budget and considered at that stage aligned with what the secretary said earlier; standards will change that'll affect cost also.

CHAIR - How does this apply to our primary industries then like our aquaculture for example?

Mr ABETZ - I would invite you to ask the relevant ministers in the relevant portfolios as to how they they deal with that within their areas.

Ms O'CONNOR - Treasurer, are you aware of Australia's National Climate Risk Assessment and Tasmania's Risk Assessment for Climate Change, two reports that have been released in the last 12 months that make it really clear the government needs to invest in mitigation across all sectors of society and their economy?

Mr ABETZ - I am aware of the reports. As to having read each word of them, no, I haven't. But aware of their thesis and, yes, I'm aware of that and as I understand it's been fed out to the various departments.

Ms O'CONNOR - I'll just draw your attention first of all to page 51 in the National Climate Risk Assessment, which is clear that Tasmania is the most risk exposed state in the country to the impacts of climate change and ask if you know why the state government made a decision not to implement a single recommendation from the state's climate risk assessment given the risk?

Mr ABETZ - Ask the climate change segment -

Ms O'CONNOR - No, you're the Treasurer, you hold the purse strings. If we're going to deal with this, you will be central to it.

Mr ABETZ - I then become responsible for every single activity in government - sure as Treasurer.

CHAIR - Treasurer does have a finger in every pie.

Mr ABETZ - Exactly, but I don't have the full hand in every pie and that is where those who do have the full hand in every pie should be asked those questions.

Ms O'CONNOR - I referred you to an identified extreme risk to Tasmanian communities, to the economy and to our environment with scientists telling us there's an extreme risk to the people of Tasmania within the next 25 or 30 years. Having a look at this Budget that you've presented, there's no indication that you understand that.

Ms FORREST - That is a comment.

Ms THOMAS - Back to public sector wage outcomes, the risk we talked about earlier of the 46 per cent of estimated total operating expenditure in 2024-25. Employee costs, the single-largest operating expenditure for the government, represent around 46 per cent of estimated total operating expenditure. Does this include heads of agency, salary remuneration packages and SES level staff and statutory authority positions?

Mr SWAIN - Heads of agencies, SES yes. If you're a statutory authority in the GGS, yes.

Ms THOMAS - Do you know what proportion of employee costs at those levels make up the Budget.

Mr SWAIN - Not off the top of my head, but it would be very small. I think it's mid two hundreds of SES against the employment base of 32,000. It will be very small.

Ms THOMAS - Is it possible to get a breakdown of the percentage of the 46 per cent? What proportion of that's made up of head of agency and SES salaries?

Mr SWAIN - I would suggest it would be a question best put to the Premier with State Service Management Office in support.
Mr ABETZ - Are we able to take it on notice and have the secretary flick-pass it to the Premier's? If that's agreeable to you, Chair.

CHAIR - If you're unable to answer.

Mr ABETZ - In fairness in relation to salaries and other things that figure, as I understand it, and I'll be corrected if I'm wrong, doesn't include contracts, for example, for school cleaning, locum nurses and doctors that are on contract. The amount of the Budget that is spent on actual salaries is higher than that 46 per cent. I think that's - 

Mr SWAIN - Sorry, I just can correct that the SES as at 30 June 2025 was 214. It is a very - the way - the reason I think it's probably best discussed with SSMO through DPAC is there are a range of specialist roles across departments that are remunerated at the higher end, so the SES is actually a partial picture of the higher employment costs in the State Service. There is a significantly higher number of specialist officers than that 214, for example.

Ms THOMAS - Yes, I hear what you're saying. Thank you.

Output Group 1 - Financial and Resource Management Services
1.3 Shareholder Advice on Government Businesses

CHAIR - If there's no other questions on that we might move on to 1.3, which is Shareholder Advice on Government Businesses. Cassy, you've got the lead on that.

Ms O'CONNOR - Thank you, Chair. I'm just interested in a broad response from the Treasurer to the state about government businesses on what seems to have been - what seems to look like - the consequence of 11 years of running down our GBEs, where former treasurer Peter Gutwein was taking 90 per cent dividends from GBEs and you've now got the Auditor-General sounding the alarm about a number of GBEs, from TT-Line, Hydro, to TasNetworks - I think even MAIB, from my recollection. Can you understand why the casual observer might form the view that our GBEs have been mismanaged over the past 11 years?

Mr ABETZ - Look, there is no doubt that the governance reforms that we've introduced have been absolutely welcomed and I think deemed as necessary, given some of the unfortunate events of the TT-Line, in particular.

In relation to the Motor Accident Insurance Board, we have the lowest premiums in the country, the most generous and quick payments out, so I think the MAIB runs a very good operation. What the Auditor-General has pointed out is that the low premium has been, if you like, subsidised by the exceptionally good investments they make, and the interest earned from those investments sort of backfill what would be the otherwise shortfall in the premiums.

As I understand it, the economic regulator provides, from time to time, guidance to the MAIB, given it is a monopoly supplier as to what it may be able to charge, and the MAIB has, in general terms, sought to charge premiums below the top level that the economic regulator has -

CHAIR - Allowed.

Mr ABETZ - Allowed. I was going to say 'suggested', but I think it is an 'allowed'. Thank you, Chair.

In those circumstances, I don't want to be a shadow director - and that is, I must say, one of those very real difficulties of being a shareholder minister, that you don't fall into the trap of being a shadow director, because the directors are appointed to run the show - but given that advice, whether MAIB premiums could do with a bit of an uplift, given that report, that will be a matter for the MAIB board to consider.

Ms O'CONNOR - Thank you. You didn't really answer the question, because when you step back from the situation that our GBEs and state-owned companies are in, they're in a lot poorer shape than they were 10 years ago. Perhaps - so, the policy of government under your predecessor a few predecessors ago, Mr Gutwein, was that GBEs in general would be required to pay a 90 per cent dividend - I think it was on after-tax profits. So, for those first few years of the Hodgman government, there was a real scouring of the GBEs' capacity to put money away, to invest in capital works, for example, and repairing their assets.

Do you agree, as a broad observation, of someone who's been in state parliament for a couple of years, that they haven't been particularly well-managed over the past 11 years, on the numbers?

Mr ABETZ - Despite two elections, I still haven't been here for two years.

Ms O'CONNOR - Haven't you? It seems like longer! I'm sure it does to you.

Mr ABETZ - I know. It seems like an eternity for you, I know.

CHAIR - The question.

Ms O'CONNOR - Look, you're not going to answer that, so what's the dividends policy of government now? What's your, as Treasurer, dividends policy towards GBEs?

Mr ABETZ - Look, I don't have a policy. The Cabinet has a policy, and the Cabinet's policy remains - 

Ms O'CONNOR - What is it?

Mr ABETZ - Like with all other policy positions, we will review - 

Ms O'CONNOR - What is it? 

Mr ABETZ - The companies; they write to me and the shareholder and the portfolio minister suggesting what they can and cannot pay by way of a dividend each year. 

CHAIR - Isn't it based on your policy though? 

Mr ABETZ - Yes. 

Ms O'CONNOR - What's the policy now? Is it the same policy as it was in 2014-15?

Mr SWAIN - Ninety per cent was kept. It still remains as the default edition. 

Mr ABETZ - I'm not aware of any change in the last few months. 

Ms O'CONNOR - It's an election promise to establish another GBE, which is TasInsure, or a state-owned company. Given your track record of running GBEs into the ground, it's not particularly promising at this point.

CHAIR - Can you get to the point?

Ms O'CONNOR - Has government done any modelling on the viability of establishing a state-owned insurance scheme, particularly given what we know is coming down the line in terms of extreme weather events - fire risk, for example, to the city of Hobart - which is not funded to be mitigated in this Budget. 

CHAIR - Is that a question?

Ms O'CONNOR - It's about TasInsure. What is the modelling? What have you - 

Mr ABETZ - We are out to market to get a - what? - scoping study undertaken and if you're doing the - what's it called? - expression of interest or request for tender, whatever it's called, to engage somebody to assist, but the secretary can provide the detail. 

Mr SWAIN - Thanks Treasurer, so we recognise that while we have some broad knowledge, we don't have specialist knowledge in relation to insurance. We are going to market to seek to get some expert advice that will help both refine the problem and examine the solutions that might be available to deal with the challenges identified. 
Ms O'CONNOR - Sure. As part of that conversation, would you, for example, have a chat with the RACT, which, if you did talk to it about the risks to insurers now, will tell you that in and around Hobart, for example, there are properties that are becoming uninsurable because of the fire risk. 

CHAIR - Have you spoken to RACT?

Ms O'CONNOR - Has the Tasmanian government engaged, for example, with Tasmania's primary community insurer, that is, the RACT on the risks involved with setting up another insurance company?

Mr ABETZ - Look, full disclosure, as a member of the RACT - as I think the vast majority of Tasmanians are, but put that on the table - yes, I've had a number of discussions and formed a good working relationship with the CEO whilst I was minister for Transport.

As you may imagine, the RACT has a lot of interest in that space and formed a good relationship with him. Then since changing portfolios, I've had a few discussions with him as, I believe, the Premier has as well. 

Ms O'CONNOR - The last question on this line of questioning. Does government accept, given that you've talked to RACT and have some understanding of climate risk, that to embark on a project like TasInsure potentially places the state's finances at some risk in future? 

Mr ABETZ - Look, it depends on how you do it, and we have every confidence that as we set about doing it, we will get all the appropriate advice to ensure that we don't prejudice the state's future finances. 

CHAIR - I have a couple of questions, I know Ms Lovell has as well.

Treasurer, in undertaking the - I think you called it the scoping study, is that what you called it? - is it still intended that TasInsure will operate under MAIB? That was what was said during the election, as I understand it. 

Mr ABETZ - I would need to remind myself of the exact wording, but in conjunction, I suppose, rather than under the MAIB, potentially in conjunction with the MAIB.

Somebody might have the exact wording. 

Mr SWAIN - Treasurer, I could - 

Mr ABETZ - You do, secretary?

Mr SWAIN - Yes, in the draft bill that was released that contemplates the establishment of a standalone business, but I think there's a lot of that work that has to be done still. It's generally the case as you articulated that the MAIB's investment fund has a purpose. That will have to be taken into regard - any assessment of its ability to participate.

CHAIR - What assessment's been made of the additional reserves that would be needed by TasInsure to be adequately funded?

Mr ABETZ - That is what the scoping study will assist us with.

CHAIR - How much is the scoping study expected to cost?

Mr BURGESS - That's out for tender at the moment. Tenders are due back later this week. At this stage, it would be imprudent to comment.

Ms LOVELL - Is there a budget allocation for it?

CHAIR - That was my next question. Where's the budget allocation for it?

Mr SWAIN - We don't want to invite bids up to any particular number.

CHAIR - It's missing from the Budget. Is that a fair statement?

Ms THOMAS - Supplementary preparation?

CHAIR - Or can it be funded within Treasury's current reserves? That's the question here.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, it can be.

CHAIR - It will be funded by Treasury's bucket money, which is not that big, so something else might have to give.

Mr SWAIN - This is a significant endeavour. As the Treasurer said this will be a scoping-type investigation. There may well need to be more work and detailed investigations on a specific model after this. Follow-on funding that's really significant is not in the Budget, but there is capacity for the initial scoping exercise.

CHAIR - To be clear, which line item is this being taken out of? There are buckets of money here and there; everyone's got their own allocation. Which line item is this being funded from?

Mr BURGESS - Mr Craigie might correct me if I'm wrong, but there's an allocation within finance general for work associated with the government businesses each year.

CHAIR - How much has that increased by?

Mr BURGESS - It hasn't increased. It's an allocation of money, which is then, as issues arise from year to year with the government businesses -

Mr SWAIN - I believe that's 500,000.

CHAIR - Maybe when we get to finance general we could look at that more fully.

Ms LOVELL - Treasurer, the scoping studies are still to be done. That work's underway. But there was a commitment made during the election this would save $250 on premiums for households or Tasmanians. What was that based on? Where did that number come from?

Mr ABETZ - I am not sure. As I understand it, that was an announcement before I was Treasurer during the campaign by the Premier. That is best directed to him.

Ms LOVELL - Have you asked him, or have you asked anyone since the election, now you are Treasurer?

Mr ABETZ - I don't -

Ms LOVELL - Or sought any advice on what that was based on?

Mr ABETZ - I don't respond to what I may or may not have said or asked the Premier about a whole range of issues.

Ms LOVELL - I am not asking about a whole range of issues. I am just asking about this -

Mr ABETZ - About a whole range of issues as a result of which your question falls into that category.

Ms LOVELL - So you've got nothing. No information for us about where that $250 saving figure has come from.

Mr ABETZ - You know where to ask that question.

CHAIR - If I can go back to the 500,000 that's in finance general for these sorts of projects, the cost of this is likely to be at least that, possibly more. It's a complex area.

Mr ABETZ - I am not going to speculate -

CHAIR - I am not suggesting that.

Mr ABETZ - especially at a time when we're out to market.

CHAIR - If it puts extra pressure on that area that is to cover other matters as well, then is it likely we will need a RAF or some other mechanism to respond to this?

Mr ABETZ - We will consider that at the time if that is the case. I don't want to speculate as to -

Mr BURGESS - It is a kind of feasibility scoping issues study. It's not necessarily going to give us all the answers or specify everything we need to know.

CHAIR - More work that needs to be done after the scoping study, is that correct?

Mr BURGESS - Absolutely. This is where we get to a second stage of, 'Okay, we've had these issues identified, we've got these options and considered those, and we're going to proceed along this way'. Then you're looking at standing up a major project.

CHAIR - What is the effective time frame for this?

Mr BURGESS - I am not sure what the government's time frames are.

CHAIR - Did you hear about the time frame for this? We've just been informed that this this is a scoping study. Then depending on what that shows, there will need to be a major projects team stood up. You obviously have sat around the Cabinet table. I am not asking for you to reveal the deliberations of Cabinet, but what's the expected timeline then for delivery of this?

Mr ABETZ - The scoping study hopefully will inform that, and I can't speculate on that.

CHAIR - You are not suggesting this financial year.

Mr ABETZ - I don't want to speculate on that. The request has gone out.

Mr SWAIN - There's some initial response by the end of December and then a more fulsome report in March.

CHAIR - That's just for the scoping study guide.

Mr SWAIN - There is also a discussion paper out now that was released by the government that has some feedback dates in it, which I'm sorry, I don't have today.

CHAIR - I am speaking about the Premier here not you. In his comments on the election, sort of assured people this would be in place to help with their insurance bills in short order.

Ms LOVELL - A 100-day plan it says will be established in 2026.

CHAIR - But that's not going to be the case. It's going to be some time away.

Mr ABETZ - All 2026 has 12 months in it -

CHAIR - We're not even going to be closing the scoping study until the end of March.

Mr ABETZ - They were the timelines provided, and time will tell whether or not they are met, but it is believed.

CHAIR - To be clear, Treasurer, the final decision around the scoping study, who's doing it, how much they're getting paid will be after March 2026?

Mr ABETZ - No, no, they're going to have a draft.

CHAIR - Whoever wins the tender will have a draft by the end of March.

Mr ABETZ - No, their full final report by the end of March, but a preliminary one by the end of this year.

CHAIR - When March comes, there'll be work for the government to do to look at how would we roll this out? And that's where the major project team would need to be appointed to progress that. Is that a fair assessment?

Ms O'CONNOR - But also if the scoping study comes back and says don't do it?

Mr SWAIN - The feedback on the discussion paper is 9 January and just in terms of that March final report, we would be looking to understand the direction in parallel to advising the government on the 2026-27 budget.

CHAIR - We might see something in the 2026-27 Budget.

Mr SWAIN - We will try to progress the work so it can inform that and then that's a matter for the government.

Ms O'CONNOR - If the scoping study comes back and it advises that it would be an enormous fiscal risk for the state to become an insurer, will you ignore that in the same way you did the Tasmanian Planning Commission about the stadium?

Mr ABETZ - Very cheap. Very cheap.

Ms O'CONNOR - You call it cheap.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, because if you allow those sorts of questions, Chair, it does invite me to have a bit of a whack back. I have been very restrained to the member for Hobart.

CHAIR - If I could just cut in here, Treasurer, if a scoping study suggested that the cost is prohibitive, then would the government respect that advice or what would be the next step?

Mr ABETZ - We have every anticipation that it won't be.

Ms O'CONNOR - Well, give the consultants the brief to say we want to set this up, write a paper that shows us how we can sell it.

Ms LOVELL - I wanted to come back to the timelines, and understand there's work to be done, budget to come that will inform it. Have you had any conversations with Treasury? I don't know if you'll allow them to answer this at the table about whether they think it's realistic for this company to be up and running in 2026 with the work that needs to be done between now and then?

Mr ABETZ - Advice to government is not something that we share, but what I can indicate to you is that that there have been discussions. The detail of them I'm not willing to share.

CHAIR - Have you got anything else, Cassy, on this line?

Ms O'CONNOR - No, not particularly.

CHAIR - I just wanted to have a couple of further ones on the credit rating agencies matter, because it doesn't just fit under here. Did Treasury undertake any analysis of the potential impact of this Budget on the state's credit rating?

Mr ABETZ - Yes, we have had discussions about that and the negative watch and how that is already - what's the term - baked in or considered in relation to the borrowings that we already have. But, I will let the secretary who - 

CHAIR - I've asked him what the Treasury advice was, so he's probably in a better place to answer.

Mr ABETZ - knows the detail of the terminology better than I do.

Mr SWAIN - I just want to be careful how I phrase this, and this again might be a good question for TASCORP in scrutiny, but the forward yield curve will have market expectations in it, and the market will have formed a view as to whether - what potential decisions credit rating agencies might take. I obviously don't want to speculate on what they might do, or talk up a particular decision.

CHAIR - So then, if I got to - in budget paper 1, there's a table that shows the average borrowing costs of 3.95 per cent, and Treasury's estimates of rising borrowing costs are shown as 5.39 per cent in 2025-26, 5.76 per cent in 2026-27, 6.11 per cent in 2027-28, and 6.4 per cent in 2028-29; has Treasury estimated the likely impact on future borrowing costs on a possible downgrade in the state's credit rating, noting that's the Treasury's expectation there?

Mr SWAIN - Yes. That information will have come from TASCORP, which will be based on its view of the yield curve, which is the rate of interest that would need to be offered, in simple terms, to be able to secure the debt. The providers of - potential providers of that debt will be building in their own expectations around ratings to the offering that's in the yield curve.

CHAIR - Does TASCORP provide advice to -

Mr SWAIN - Treasury, yes.

CHAIR - To Treasury. It's then provided to the credit rating agencies?

Mr SWAIN - No. TASCORP provides advice to Treasury around that forward yield curve in relation to 10-year bonds. That is used by Treasury to inform assumptions around the budget and future interest costs.

CHAIR - Okay. So, these are figures provided by TASCORP; the state borrows from TASCORP. I go back to the question: has Treasury estimated the likely impact on future borrowing costs - noting our borrowings are increasing - of a downgrade in the state's credit ratings?

Mr SWAIN - Well, only as I've talked about that embedded in those numbers are some expectations from the market, and then that is ultimately reflected in the borrowing costs that you cited in your very first question.

CHAIR - So, in the instance that a further credit downgrade was made, what impact does - well, has Treasury modelled the impact of that, on our borrowings? What it would look like?

Mr SWAIN - No, we haven't, because I'm saying the way that we leverage off the work of TASCORP is there are already a set of expectations around where the credit rating is likely to go built into the numbers we use.

Ms O'CONNOR - What is that expectation?

Mr SWAIN - It's the interest rates that, effectively, you read out. 

Ms O'CONNOR - Is there an expectation of a downgrade, then?

Mr SWAIN - I'm not wanting to comment on that.

Output Group 1 - Financial and Resource Management Services
1.4 Government Property and Accommodation Services

CHAIR - If there are no other questions on that line, we'll move to the next, which is government property and accommodation. Bec?

Ms THOMAS - Thank you. Just for context here, so I make sure I try to direct my questions in the right way, can you explain the difference between line item 1.4 here and 4.7, in finance general, and why they're separated? This is property and accommodation services - and 4.7 is property management services. Property and accommodation services says 'management of government-owned and leased office buildings and the disposal of Crown property'; 4.7, property management services says, 'building depreciation and rental and other occupancy costs related to office accommodation.' 

CHAIR - That's in finance general. So one's in Treasury finance, and one's in finance general.

Ms THOMAS - But the descriptions are similar, so it's hard to understand what the difference is.

Mr CRAIGIE - Treasury the agency manages the whole-of-government accommodation, property and leases and owns a number of buildings, and there is a team of people that incur costs to do that. The cost of the leases is reflected in finance general. 

Ms THOMAS - Okay, sure. If I want information on the cuts that were proposed through the election, and $12 million of savings proposed through office leasing improvements, that would be under 4.7, or would it be under here?

Mr CRAIGIE - Sorry, can you speak up?

Ms THOMAS - During the election there were cuts proposed or savings proposed through office leasing improvements. Is this - 

Mr CRAIGIE - No, they've been allocated to agencies. Whilst the Treasury enters the lease with the landowner, we then allocate that space to agencies. For example, the Parliament Square tower adjacent to this building, we leased that whole building and there are multiple agencies in that building. We have the relationship with the landlord, but we then allocate the space to the agencies and the agencies pay into finance general the cost of that lease. The actual cost of the space is ultimately borne by the tenant agency, but to allow for efficiencies, we centrally manage that. There's a table in budget paper 2, volume 1, chapter 1: that summarises the election commitments, and that shows how that saving has been allocated across agencies specifically.

Ms THOMAS - Right, so that would be individual agency's savings?

Mr CRAIGIE - Yes.

Ms THOMAS - Okay, thank you. There's just a small increase over the forward Estimates projected in this line item. Is that just general increases?

Mr CRAIGIE - The line item is quite complicated because of the way we have to account for leases, the recognition of a right-to-use asset and a liability. There's a range of what are effectively journal entries to create that line item, but a flatter or slightly rising trend would suggest that we are not seeing significant increases in property costs going forward, we will not need to acquire significantly new office space, or we are able to get more efficient use of our existing office space.

Ms THOMAS - There was an Auditor-General's report that made recommendations to Treasury in relation to management of major office accommodation, and the Treasury's response was that all those recommendations were agreed, and the recommendations would be implemented. I think the last one to be implemented was for Treasury to review its suite of guidelines, policies and instructions relating to major office accommodation using utilisation data by 30 September 2025; has that been completed and have all of those recommendations been implemented now? 

Mr CRAIGIE - All the recommendations have been completed. In terms of actioning, the one about maximising the utilisation of office space is ongoing as we look to work with agencies and their strategic accommodation plans and our footprint of leasing and match the two portfolios, for want of a better phrase.

Ms THOMAS - Has Treasury undertaken any recent reviews of the state's office accommodation footprint?

Mr CRAIGIE - It's ongoing. 

Ms THOMAS - Ongoing - ongoing review. 

Mr CRAIGIE - We have regular interaction with agencies on their strategic accommodation plans and what footprints they think they want and need, and the current leasing obligations they have. The current savings measures in the Budget around that have stimulated a lot more conversations recently, so we're actively working with agencies and landlords around the best utilisation of the portfolio we have.

Ms THOMAS - Does the government intend to dispose of any property assets this year?

Mr ABETZ - Well, we're looking at the Treasury building; that's being scoped as we speak.

CHAIR - That's not the first time.

Ms THOMAS - Yes, that's what I was about to say. How has that decision been arrived at, given it has been something that's been on the agenda before and then taken off the table, put on again? Why does this revolving door keep happening, or roundabout keep happening? Is it seriously going to happen this time?

Mr ABETZ - Well, that depends on what the market tells us, I suppose. A decision will need to be made. It is out there in the marketplace and you can give us an update as to where we're at.

Mr SWAIN - I mean, it's a significant public asset and it's not unreasonable that its highest [inaudible] is tested periodically. As, I think the Treasurer is alluding to, we're going through a three-phase procurement. We're up to the second phase. If we get to the third phase that will be specific bids through a closed process.

Ms O'CONNOR - Purchase or repurpose?

Mr SWAIN - The expression-of-interest phase now could be for a variety of different uses, but depending on what that yields, the government will then make a decision whether it wants to go forward. Of course, it will have to take into consideration matters like the Valuer-General's view on the value of the building and also the alternate costs for Treasury rental. We will have to wait and see what comes out of the market bids.

Ms THOMAS - Are the costs of undertaking that procurement process incorporated in this line item then? Because that would come at a cost to the taxpayer and it's a cost that's been incurred before.

Mr CRAIGIE - I think the repurposing process is funded out of Treasury rather than finance general.

Ms THOMAS - We are -

CHAIR - It's under this line item. You're talking about finance general. It's under line item 1.4, in Treasury and Finance. Is that correct?

Mr CRAIGIE - Yes, that's where it would be funded.

CHAIR - Just on that - when you look at the expenses table on Treasury and Finance in relation to this line item, page 298, Budget Paper 1, when you get the actuals for that, the budget was $2.5 million, effectively. It was $2.8 million actual expenditure and that drops down to $2.7 million. What's saving - I mean, it's not a huge amount, but there's not a lot of money in Treasury for doing a lot of things, it seems.

Can you explain what blew the cost there, acknowledging that you spent less overall. Could have been a bit of shifting of the deck chairs, maybe. Overall, that's one that did go up in the actual expenditure.

Mr CRAIGIE - The output expense summary?

CHAIR - Total expense by portfolio and output and the actuals that were provided but also in your annual report obviously. The actual was higher than the budget and also higher than the Budget for this year. It probably got stolen from one of the others who were less. I'm just saying.

Mr CRAIGIE - Look, it may have had something to do with the volume of property sales and the number of new leases we entered into during the year. I'm just looking at the - it's partly driven by employee costs, it's partly driven by supplies and consumables. They're the main drivers.

CHAIR - It's a lot to do with - the Treasury manages, under this line item, I assume, the leases for all the members' offices. There's a whole heap of new members.

Mr CRAIGIE - No. That's done through Premier and Cabinet.

CHAIR - So it's not related to that?

Mr CRAIGIE - Under the TI, we manage office accommodation for general government sector agencies, but in support for members is done through DPAC.

Ms THOMAS - What is the budget allocation actually spent on then if it's not the lease fees?

Mr CRAIGIE - If I take the Budget year where the total expenditure is estimated to be $2.7 million, $2.2 was employee-related costs, and an odd $300,000 is supplies and consumables. So, it's predominantly headcount.

Ms THOMAS - So, those people are doing what? Liaising with the government agencies?

Mr CRAIGIE - There's a team that do predominantly three things.

We own a number of buildings: the Treasury building, the St John's building in Launceston, Kirksway Place. And so, there's facilities work around the maintenance and running of those buildings. If someone - you know, if it's a leaking tap or a lift stops working, there's a team that do building maintenance in the facilities.

I have a - there's a leasing team that manage the whole-of-government leases. I think we've got about 70-odd leases across the state. 

And then, there's a property sales team that sells surplus properties. So, from time to time, government agencies declare a property surplus - like an old police home in a rural area, or an old school - and that's referred to Treasury to sell. We go through an extensive process where we consult with agencies if they've got an alternate use for that property, or Homes Tasmania can seek an opportunity for that land, and if they don't, we then put it through a public sales process.

Mr SWAIN - If I could just add to that: Obviously, there's an efficiency of having that expertise in a particular department, but there's also market intelligence so that we don't end up with one department bidding off against another department to raise a lease that is ultimately going to be used by government. So, that means that the commercial intelligence for lease rates and terms around the state sit in one place.

Mr CRAIGIE - For example, if Education and Health both want to lease the same space, it's not efficient for government if they're both competing with each other and the landlord. Treasury acts as an arbiter between who gets the space and does the negotiations directly, so the government has one voice to the market rather than multiple voices to the market.

Ms O'CONNOR - Thank you. Has the Valuer-General undertaken an evaluation on the Treasury building, a very significant public asset?

I'll just remind you, in the process, that this sale of the Treasury building was not taken to an election.

Mr ABETZ - It was, I thought.

Ms O'CONNOR - I don't think so,

Mr ABETZ - I thought it was part of our election - policy and costings at the last election. 

But, as at the 30 June 2024, the Valuer-General advised that the fair value of the land and buildings portfolio was $22.6 million, and I assume that figure applies to the Treasury building here called Treasury Building Complex.
Ms O'CONNOR - And does - I mean, clearly, that valuation must take into account the heritage values within the building, which are highly significant. Can I ask: what's the sort of threshold here that the government might apply, if you have a bid come in - if it doesn't meet what was then the value according to the Valuer-General of the Treasury building, not taking into account its public value, what will the government be taking into account in terms of assessing those bids, noting that the words that have been used publicly are 'repurpose', not 'sale'? What's the scope of what the government could be looking at, and where's the threshold where you say it's just not worth it?

Mr ABETZ - Look, again, it's a hypothetical question -

Ms O'CONNOR - It's not; it's an important question.

Mr ABETZ - It depends on the detail of each bid or each request. Some might be offering us a lot more on heritage as opposed to money or something else, and so you have to weigh up all the considerations - and I'm not going to, especially in an open forum where we are considering potential bids or requests for this building, to say, 'Right, any bid under such-and-such won't be accepted.' I don't want to influence that in any way, shape or form.

Ms O'CONNOR - Can I just explore - is this an exercise in offloading a public asset in order to get sort of a quick hit of money, or is it a genuine testing of the market to see what's out there?

Mr ABETZ - Look, it's a genuine testing of the market, and after that, a determination will be made as to whether it's a reasonable proposition, all things considered.

Ms O'CONNOR - So, the budget papers identify the repurposing - or whatever you want to call it - of the Treasury building as a budget risk aligned with having to find office accommodation presumably for the Department of Treasury and Finance. Has any of that been costed?

Mr SWAIN - Sorry, Chair. That's why it's identified as a risk, because that work hasn't been done. We are recognising that there is potentially a significant cost with that rental. At the moment very simplistically, Treasury occupies a building it owns which has high maintenance costs because it's a heritage sandstone building that requires more maintenance than a modern building. It is hard to reconfigure or rewire and those sort of things. It doesn't face the rental cost, so it would be what that net package looks like.

Ms O'CONNOR - Treasurer, if through the registration of interest process, what comes forward does not meet whatever the threshold is that you apply of return to government and better use that protects heritage, is the government open to the possibility of deciding not to sell it?

Mr ABETZ - As I say, I get into trouble.

Ms O'CONNOR - Is it policy to sell the Treasury building?

Mr ABETZ - I get into trouble for saying never say never, but that is realistically the answer. We have to see what all the parameters are of any offer and then make the considerations as alternate premises for Treasury et cetera. All that needs to be weighed up and there are so many imponderables there until we have something firm on the table, but it's difficult for me to provide you with an answer.

Ms O'CONNOR - Would you describe it as government policy to sell the Treasury building and following the registration of interest process, what kind of public interest test would government apply to its decision making?

Mr ABETZ - The government always applies to everything in the public interest.

Ms O'CONNOR - Except the stadium.

CHAIR - Let's just let the Treasurer answer in respect to the Treasury building.

Mr ABETZ - If we're talking public interest, even the Lord Mayor of Hobart's report told us $179 million economic stimulus within the city of Hobart - 

CHAIR - We might need to move on. 	We're getting bogged down. I might close this line item off and go to 1.5, which is Government Procurement Services.

Ms O'CONNOR - You're verbaling the Council. Could we just understand the question about the Treasury building - 

CHAIR - No, we've moved on.

Ms O'CONNOR - But he didn't answer it.

CHAIR - Because you threw the stadium in, let's move on.

Ms O'CONNOR - I see - that gives him the excuse not to answer.

Mr CRAIGIE - On the repurposing website, there is a FAQ section and there is a specific question, does repurpose mean selling the site to a developer? There is a broad answer that repurposing can meet a range of things.

Ms O'CONNOR - Thank you, James. Thank you.

Mr CRAIGIE - I will just state the obvious.

Ms O'CONNOR - No, that's good to have on the record.

Output Group 1 - Financial and Resource Management Services 1.5 Government Procurement Services

Ms LOVELL - Treasurer, we've moved on to government procurement services. I note there's a decrease in the funding profile for this line item, which is explained on page 299 as primarily reflecting the reallocation of funding for the Transition to Electric Vehicles initiative and a reallocation of funding to other outputs. Can you provide some more detail on the breakdown of that funding and where that funding has been reallocated to?

Mr ABETZ - I think Mr Craigie might be able to help there.
Mr CRAIGIE - Yes, I can provide some information. The reallocation of funding for the transition to Electric Vehicles initiative has been moved across the forward Estimates. This includes $375,000 from 2024-25 and $258,000 from 2025-26 reallocated to 2026-27 and 2027-28.

Ms LOVELL - There seems to be quite a significant decrease in funding then on previous years for this line item.

Mr CRAIGIE - It reflects under-expenditure in prior years and because the project is continuing, the funding has been moved. Time shifted to reflect when it's likely to be incurred.

Ms LOVELL - Is there anything else normally funded under this line item because there's no funding allocated in 2028-29?

Mr CRAIGIE - Where is that, sorry?

Ms LOVELL - Page 300 says it's about provision of advice in relation to government procurement activities, the management of whole-of-government contracts and the administration of the Tasmanian Risk Management Fund and other insurance related matters. Has that funding been reallocated to somewhere else in the budget?

Mr CRAIGIE - No. There was specific funding for the transition to electric vehicles. Because that output group manages the motor vehicle fleet, the funding was allocated against that output. It was largely to assist agencies with installation of charging infrastructure. That continues.

The output in Treasury is predominantly the people cost. It is a bit like the the property one, but the fleet and the TRMF and those costs are reflected in the finance general.

Ms LOVELL - Okay. There was a government commitment at the election to achieve $20 million in budget savings from procurement processes across the Budget and forward Estimates. What role will Treasury be playing in assisting agencies to achieve those savings?

Mr CRAIGIE - My answer is going to sound very similar to the same question on property. The table in budget paper 2, volume 1, chapter 1 shows the allocation of those procurement savings across agencies. Treasury is responsible for the procurement policy, and we manage a few whole-of-government contracts. Individual agencies do the purchasing out of their appropriations, so the savings are allocated to where the cost of the purchasing really occurs.

Ms LOVELL - What role will Treasury play in helping agencies achieve those savings or assisting them in that?

Mr CRAIGIE - We will work with agencies where we manage whole-of-government contracts that agencies purchase from, but agencies also do a significant amount of procurement on their own behalf. It will be up to them to find the savings that are allocated.

Ms LOVELL - Are you expecting there to be any centralising of those procurement services or any increase in whole-of-government contracting?

Mr CRAIGIE - Potentially, we're currently working through a whole-of-government procurement on EV infrastructure, so we get consistency across agencies and transferability, but there may be other opportunities.

Ms LOVELL - Have you had any discussions or identified any of those other opportunities so far? Are there any under consideration?

Mr CRAIGIE - There's an inter-agency procurement group that meets regularly. I am sure it will be prosecuted through that, but not aware of any specific new initiatives that have come out of this budget measure yet.

Mr SWAIN - We are having a general look at the efficiency of procurement and some of our arrangements, and whether they can be streamlined, including the pre-qualification systems that currently work in relation to building and construction. There's an ongoing program of work in the branch looking at whether you can streamline the processes with procurement and the associated costs, then, for agencies.

CHAIR - Treasurer, as you mentioned earlier, the Treasury is releasing the fiscal sustainability report in February this year. I understand Treasury is using a new model. Is that correct?

Mr SWAIN - Yes. Part of the work will involve using a computerised general equilibrium model to test some of the results. It is a Treasury piece of work that's done every five years under statute. I have discussed very openly with the Treasurer that it needs to be an impartial piece of work. I have deliberately, and the Treasurer has supported us, not gone into detail about the methodology and arrangements. Certainly, when it is finalised, it would be made available to government before it is in the public domain, but we need to finish the work impartially first.

CHAIR - Will it be expanded out to include the total state sector, not just the GGS, and if not, why not? 

Mr BURGESS - At this stage, the intention - and we're still working through the methodology to do it - is to include total state debt.

CHAIR - Excellent news. That's a big tick for your team there, Treasurer.

I'm not sure whether you want me to ask questions around the GST under this or 2.3?

Mr ABETZ - Either way.

CHAIR - Do it here?

Mr ABETZ - In the one minute we've got left?

CHAIR - No, quarter past.
Mr ABETZ - Oh, 1.15 p.m. My apologies.

CHAIR - Budget paper 1 rightly highlights that there is a material risk to Tasmania of any further changes to GST arrangements. This is likely to be exacerbated by the extensive and professional campaign by the West Australian government, together with the apparent lack of any concerted public campaign by the Tasmanian government to correct the misinformation currently being reported. Now, I note that the terms of reference are out for that review.

Given this, Treasurer, what are you doing to ensure Tasmania's interests are protected and that Tasmanians rightly receive their fair share of GST, and therefore access to services and infrastructure that other states have, in the future?

Mr ABETZ - Thank you very much for that question. The only difficulty I have with that is where do I start? We've got a 2026 Productivity Commission inquiry that we will be making a submission to. As a member of the Board of Treasurers, I can let you know that all my colleagues from territories and states - 

CHAIR - Other than Western Australia. 

Mr ABETZ - other than one particular one, are very exercised to ensure that the GST distribution is fair and reasonable. In 2018, I think it was, when Western Australia got its extra amount and then to make that work, there was the no-worse-off guarantee (NWOG) provided by the federal government which expires in 2029. That is why we are already taking action now in anticipation -

CHAIR - Western Australians are on their front foot here. They've been out very publicly, actively campaigning -

Mr ABETZ - You know why? Because they've got a stack of money to burn on full-page advertisements in The Australian, et cetera, which we don't, but -

CHAIR - You need to pool your resources.

Mr ABETZ - that said, I have raised it in Question Time many a time. I know the person who in fact chairs the Council for the Australian Federation (CAF), has been putting a lot of effort into those representations as well. Our head of DPAC, Ms Morgan-Wicks, is the chair of the counterpart of that, of the heads of the various premier and cabinet -

CHAIR - Where's Treasury in this?

Mr ABETZ - She is doing work on that. As I said, with Treasury, the Board of Treasurers, we have got together, we are making representations and we will be making our representations to the Productivity Commission, which will start its inquiry in 2026. We will be putting a very strong submission to them about the need for horizontal fiscal equalisation (HFE), which was -

Ms O'CONNOR - We used to have that.

CHAIR - It was your government when you were in power in the federal parliament that undermined it.
Mr ABETZ - Which was a very good model and one that I believe -

CHAIR - Should've been maintained.

Mr ABETZ - should have been maintained. I hope that we can get back to that or something very similar, then Tasmania would then be on a better financial footing, if that were to occur. 

CHAIR - Treasurer, you really have an obligation to not only do this work behind closed doors and put in the submission, but also correct misstatements in the media. Now, you quoted from The Advocate earlier, but there was a quote in the Mercury on 6 November where it referred to Tasmania's 'outrageously inflated GST share'. Did you not pull that one into line?

Mr ABETZ - Well, look, there are so many misrepresentations of -

CHAIR - This is an important one, Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - Tasmania's GST revenue that if I were to respond to each one, I dare say that is all I would be doing. But look, a very good pick-up, and what I would say to anybody is that in this parliament we all share that responsibility and if we come across a misrepresentation of that nature, it would be very helpful if independent members of the parliament, Green members, Labor, or indeed me as Treasurer were to try to counter that misinformation. But feel free when you come across anything of that nature, feed it in, more than happy to try to smack it down -

CHAIR - The government has a far bigger budget than I do to do the public media.

Mr ABETZ - but it's a bit like whack-a-mole at the moment. It sort of pops up everywhere and every now and then we hit one down, but then another one pops up.

Mr SWAIN - Just a couple of points: the historical interaction between Treasury and both the Commonwealth Grants Commission and Productivity Commission has been very active in this space, and in the relativity adjustment that's just occurred, that actually includes a change in the way that wage costs are assessed in Tasmania, which was a long and detailed and complex discussion over several years - which sounds quite esoteric, but is also worth about $100 million a year to Tasmania's GST. So we're very active in this space.

The initial submission to the Productivity Commission is due in February; the final report is due at the end of the year. There is some space between those two events for the Board of Treasurers to discuss what level of public activity they want to support in relation to the GST. In fact, the Treasurer did get me to do some briefing to the multi-partisan budget repair panel about the potential for that panel to talk with a united voice from Tasmania, on an issue where there probably isn't a divergence of views across the parliament about this important -

Ms O'CONNOR - That's right. There isn't.

Mr ABETZ - Yes. And so, that is what we are trying to put together as well, but with that -

CHAIR - I'd like to see a bit more public-facing work done on this, to stand up for ourselves.

Mr BURGESS - If I may, Treasurer: the intergovernmental team in Treasury is very focused on this and very aware of the issues, and obviously monitoring particularly the action of WA and looking to prepare arguments in response to that. We have - the issues paper is due out - the first paper is due out this month, and I think we have an appointment later this month with the Treasurer and Treasury to meet with the Productivity Commission. We will obviously be starting the journey presenting our arguments, but to the extent we can achieve it, we're looking for a broad-based advocacy program in this space.

CHAIR - You've got lots of friends.

Mr BURGESS - Yes.

Ms O'CONNOR - On this issue.

CHAIR - On this issue, yes. I'm talking about this issue.

Mr ABETZ - And look, to let you in on something I've been working on, I've been drafting - my office has a general motion about the GST to submit to the parliament and hopefully get support for it, that we might be able to speak with one voice.

Ms O'CONNOR - Just the facts.

Mr ABETZ - Yes-

CHAIR - I mean, Treasury has previously put in some very good submissions.

Mr ABETZ - I don't want to be political in it to get full support, because irrespective of who may or may not be in government from time to time, having a fair horizontal fiscal equalisation policy baked into the GST distribution is fundamentally important.

CHAIR - Can I just go, then, to some of the economic forecasts that I believe sit under this area? Tasmania's GSP is forecast - or was reported as 0 per cent growth in 2024-25, 1 per cent for 2025-26, and 2.25 per cent for 2026-27. So, Treasurer, what is your confidence in these forecasts, given the current economic conditions?

Mr ABETZ - Look, my confidence is that I have confidence in the people sitting to the left and right of me. I don't claim any special expertise in this particular area as to make those forecasts, and therefore rely very heavily on advice. But, at the end of the day, that which is put in the public domain through these documents is mine; I have to be answerable for them. But, as you may imagine, I would like -

CHAIR - So, you're confident about meeting those forecasts?

Mr ABETZ - All the advice that I've been given is that I can be confident of that, and given that I have no other information before me to contradict that, I'm willing to accept it.

Mr SWAIN - I'll probably hand to Dean on that - this one, if it's okay with you, but I guess what we are seeking to do in these Estimates is to present a balanced picture which is not excessively optimistic or pessimistic. There are - it's acknowledged in the economic chapter that the trade environment is highly uncertain, in particular the secondary effects - not so much the primary effect of America's trade relationship with Australia, which is I think about 7 per cent of our goods trade for Tasmania.

Mr ABETZ - Beef tariffs, I've just noticed Mr Trump seems to have backed off on that, and I understand some of our beef goes to the United States. So, that is a bit of an uplift -

CHAIR - Moving feast, that is.

Ms O'CONNOR - Totally unreliable; you're dealing with a madman. I mean, you wouldn't want to count on anything he did or said.

Mr ABETZ - So, that is an uplift for us -

CHAIR - Order.

Mr ABETZ - So, that is a potential uplift for us. This, I suppose, makes the point of the difficulty in trying to come to a figure; you've got to take into account all these factors and it is genuinely a moving feast, and I better be careful how many economists I might insult on this, but I understand the vast majority of economists didn't predict the global financial crisis or any recessions, depressions, so it is the best guesstimate, an educated guess that economists provide.

That is by going back to your favourite topic, member for Hobart, the cost/benefit ratio. Every single economist that's looked at it has come up with a different figure -

Ms O'CONNOR - For the stadia?

Mr ABETZ - Because it's not an exact science, and what a good guess, your favourite topic. I didn't name it, but you just did.

Ms O'CONNOR - It's not my favourite, but it's very topical.

Mr BURGESS - If I could maybe just add a bit of commentary back to your original question. The gross state product actuals and forecasts are a good reflection of what the Reserve Bank was hoping to achieve with its narrow path through address inflation without causing serious economic impacts. What we're expecting, yes, zero growth in 24-25, but as interest rates are forecast to decline, we expect consumer confidence and business confidence to increase, which is why we're seeing a slow uptick in growth in the out years.

CHAIR - Is there anybody else got any questions on 2.1? I'll just see if we can do 2.2 before lunch, but we might need to come back to this one. Dean, did you have some questions there?

Output Group 2 - Economic and Fiscal Policy Advice

Mr HARRISS - Treasurer, back in the 22-23 budget papers that which was the first forward Estimates for this that included 25-26, the regulatory policy had $4.3 million allowed allocation, it's down to $3.26 million, can you give some indication why that's dropped off from that full lesson?

Mr ABETZ - That is before my time, honourable member for Huon. I don't know if somebody's got a historical record on that.

Mr SWAIN - Sorry, I'm just hoping to find the 2.6 bit.

Mr HARRISS - Two-point-two?

CHAIR - Line item 2.2 which is regulatory policy.

Mr HARRISS - Just from where it was first allocated in forward Estimates back in 22-23. It was $4.36 million, so over a million dollars above what has been allocated this year.

Mr SWAIN - It's an ongoing output that's been around. It sort of predates me; I'm wondering if there was a specific initiative or reason for an uplift.

CHAIR - Just for the purpose of Hansard, if you'd like to introduce yourself, too.

Mr ROOT - Jonathan Root, Deputy Secretary, Revenue and Regulatory Services. I can't say that I can cover the full difference, but I would say the majority of it is in relation to gaming-policy projects that were in that output back then, principally the player card gaming reforms that have some components of that has moved into at the back end of the future, gaming market reforms have moved into the liquor and gaming regulation output, and some of those costs are on hold due to the suspension of the player card gaming initiative while the government continues to consider the gambling-harm reforms. I suspect that's the majority of that gap. I can't say that's the full - I think there's probably about $800,000 of it.

Mr HARRISS - No, I suspected that. Back in November 2024 when the government announced deferring the pre-commitment player card, it mentioned broader harm-minimisation packages or a package. Are you able to provide any details on the progress of that?

CHAIR - Is that under this line or is it under 3.2?

Mr ABETZ - We have the official here that can assist us in that regard.

Mr ROOT - Some of the policy components of liquor and gaming are in this output. The other output is largely the operational activities and compliance for it. The government, in its election commitments, committed to looking into a number of technologies in addition to the player card technologies which have been the focus of the policy prior to that. Facial recognition being one, automated responsible gambling systems being another, and improvements to the Tasmanian Gaming Exclusion Scheme. Those investigations are progressing and the government will be considering that material in due course. That's pretty much where we're at this stage.

CHAIR - I'm just conscious of the time. We might have other questions. We might break for lunch now because we've only got 45 minutes, but you're back a bit after that because we've got the Auditor-General coming in straight after lunch. Haven't we? Sorry, that's later. We will take a break now and come back at 2 o'clock to try to finish off Treasury and finance general, which is going to be a massive task.

The committee suspended from 1.17 p.m. to 2 p.m.
