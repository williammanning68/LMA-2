PETITION

Quad Bike Reforms

[11.01 a.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - Mr President, on indulgence, before I table the petition, I acknowledge the presence in the Chamber today of Sonia van den Heuvel and Julius Daguman (OK), who in February 2023 lost their precious and beloved daughter, Jocelyn,[checked] in a quad bike tragedy that could arguably have been avoided.

I have the honour to present an e-petition from 418 Tasmanian citizens who request the House to call on the government to implement the recommendations of the 2024 investigation by Coroner Robert Webster into the death of Jocelyn Daguman as a result of the quad bike all-terrain vehicle accident by introducing legislation that:

requires mandatory training and licencing of all persons using quad bikes;

prohibits children under the age of 16 from operating adult-sized quad bikes;

prohibits children under the age of 16 from operating 'youth-size' quad bikes other than in accordance with what is specified by the manufacturers to be the appropriate minimum age for such vehicle; and

prohibits children under the age of six from operating any quad bike in any circumstances whatsoever.

	Further, that such legislative reform and community education ensure that quad bike users wear helmets, and only be operated in accordance with the operator's manual, particularly to ensure the wearing of seatbelts and the use of cage nets and/or doors.
	
Members - Hear, hear.
	
Petition received.

STATEMENT FROM LEADER FOR THE GOVERNMENT

Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Statistics

[11.10 a.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President,

I seek leave to make a statement to an answer I provided for the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Amendment Bill of 2025.

Leave granted.

Mr President, I advise the Chamber with regard to the RWVP statistics for 2024-25, as at 30 June, there were 198,500 people who are registered to work with vulnerable people in Tasmania. As a result, six reports were made to the registrar, and 3284 additional risk assessments were commenced. 44 individuals had their registration suspended and 24 had their registrations cancelled.

I amend the Hansard record as follows: with regard to the RWVP statistics for 2024-25, as at 30 June, 198,500 people are registered to work with vulnerable people in Tasmania and as a result of reports made to the registrar, 3284 additional risk assessments were commenced. 44 individuals had their registration suspended and 24 their registrations cancelled.

I apologise, Mr  President. I didn't read the note well enough. Thank you.


RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

Mr PRESIDENT - Honourable members, before moving on to our orders of the day, I welcome the year 9 students from The Hutchins School. We've got two groups coming through today. We've just been through our opening sequence of parliament where we have set business, and now we're about to move on to our orders of the day, which is dealing with government legislation. We've got a few third readings and second readings of bills before the parliament to get through today.

All members of the Council will get an opportunity to speak about that legislation. I know that they will join me in making you feel welcome to the Legislative Council and hoping that you have a good tour through the Parliament of Tasmania today.

Members - Hear, hear.

TERRORISM LEGISLATION (EXTENSION) BILL 2025 (No. 52)

Second Reading

Continued from (xxx date) page (xxx).

Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I had concluded the second reading speech and so I will listen to contributions from members. Thank you.

[11.15 a.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - Mr President. I rise to indicate, of course, that the Greens will not be opposing the Terrorism Legislation (Extension) Bill of 2025. We appreciate the amendment that was made by Professor Razay in the other place that narrowed the time period for the extension from 10 years to five years, noting that there's a review underway of this framework, just as there is at the national level.

I thought that the Leader for Government's second reading speech yesterday was quite interesting and nuanced, and I was pleased to hear acknowledgement of the breadth and depth of the security threats that we face here in Australia and sadly - although we like to think we're immune - in Tasmania, and particularly the recognition of the threat of domestic terrorism. All members in this place will have looked on in dismay, I suspect, at the 'white Australia' rallies that were held some weeks ago and again some weeks before that. We've seen the rise in this country of neo-Nazi and far-right organisations that have a stated objective to disrupt our society and at some level of course, their purpose is to terrorise our society. If you want to have a look at an example of that, the incident in Melbourne some short weeks ago, where following the white Australia rally, a gang of National Socialist Network operatives led by New Zealand-born Thomas Sewell stormed a peaceful First Nations camp in Melbourne, causing immense distress. In fact, inflicting violence on those people who were peacefully gathered there.

As much as it pains me, as a Green, to say that you do need some kind of preventative law enforcement capacity in place - clearly, we do - given the changing and broad nature of the threat from terrorism, whichever form it comes in. We have had ASIO acknowledge the growing threat of far-right extremism. We have the National Socialist Network recruiting young people through social media, particularly disaffected young men, and it's a real challenge for us as a society to be very mindful of how vulnerable some boys and young men can be to hate and extremism via rabbit holes that they can go down or be led down on social media. To give you some indication of just how serious the National Socialist Network threat is, I will read to you a little bit from Thomas Sewell shortly, but we had an incident in New South Wales just last week where New South Wales police, for reasons unknown, approved a racist neo-Nazi gathering on the steps of the New South Wales parliament. This is the same police force that has treated peaceful Palestinian protesters, in some instances, in a very thuggish and dangerous way, leading to injuries of peaceful protesters.

I think law enforcement broadly, nationally, has some work to do to come to terms with the nature and the extent of the threat posed by domestic terrorism. This is a story that was reported on ABC News, 7.30 Report, 13 November 2024. The headline is neo-Nazi leader Thomas Sewell says he could 'become a terrorist as far-right rhetoric escalates and movement grows', and he told his supporters he could 'become a terrorist', and 'start killing people' if Child Protective Services intervene and remove children from neo-Nazi families. Speaking on a podcast, the leader of the neo-Nazi group, the National Socialist Network, told the audience that if children were removed by court order, he would undertake terrorist violence and encourage others to do the same. That should send a chill down the spine of every person.

Sewell's statements, the article goes on to read, falsely claim that authorities threatened to remove children from families that hold far-right beliefs in the United Kingdom and he says, and I will end with this quote from him:

If you take my child off me, I am going to start killing people and I am going to encourage every single person that I know to also start killing people that are responsible, starting with probably the police and the judges that ordered for a child to come off of one of us. (TBC)

he told followers in June. These are very, very dangerous people and there is now a move on the part of the National Socialist Network to establish a political party and at this stage, as far as I read the name, they want to call that party, what a surprise, is the White Australia Party. These forces are racist, misogynist -

Ms Forrest - Sexist.

Ms O'CONNOR - Sexist.

Ms Forrest - Ableist, all the 'ists'.

Ms O'CONNOR - Ableist, all of the above. All the 'ists', thank you, member for Murchison. They represent a threat to the peaceful fabric of our society, they also represent a challenge to us in how we counter misinformation, disinformation, right-wing extremism and where these entities get their support and funding from is a question that I hope ASIO is examining. This is an infection that's happening in democratic countries around the world. Look to the United States, look to the United Kingdom, countries like Germany and here. 

The far right has been emboldened and its mission is to terrorise people and to undermine the foundations of democracy and we simply cannot allow that to happen and it's part of the reason why a piece of legislation like this which does expand police powers, let's be realistic, and it now extends that expansion of police powers, is arguably one part of that response, noting that in Tasmania, to date, this legislation has not needed to be invoked and let's hope it stays that way, because we can't pretend that the National Socialist Network isn't here, Mr President. They were gathered on Salamanca lawns some short weeks ago when the Greens had a little office down on the waterfront opposite Elizabeth Wharf. We came to work one day and there were neo-Nazi stickers slapped all over our office. These people are a threat to minorities and they are a threat to our way of life and I am personally reassured that our national security services are coming to grips with the nature of the threat and hopefully working across jurisdictions to counter it and with those few words again, again, I indicate we won't be opposing this extension of the the terrorism legislative framework as it is today.

[11.25 a.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I have just a brief summing up to acknowledge the contribution of the member for Hobart and the fact that this would be Prof George Razay's first amendment in the parliament. I think that's worthy of noting that he had managed to secure an amendment through the House of Assembly, and now it's possibly going to be part of this legislation in our Legislative Council.

I also acknowledge the comprehensive second reading speech, that was prepared by representatives of the department, it certainly helps to outline the process of the bill, thank you.

Bill read the second time.

Recognition of Visitors

Mr PRESIDENT - Before that question, I will welcome the second group from grade 9 from The Hutchins School. We're going through the process at the moment of putting a bill through the Legislative Council. It is a bill that's come from the House of Assembly. It has come to us and, as you heard, was amended by a new member of parliament in the lower House. What we're about to do is go into the Committee stage where the members of the Council will examine the bill clause by clause, and then vote at the end of that.

I am sure all my colleagues here will join me in making you welcome to the parliament today.

Members - Hear, hear.

ORDER OF BUSINESS

Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) (by leave) - Mr President, I move - 

That intervening business be deferred until after consideration of Order of the Day No. 5, which is the poisons amendment, interstate prescriptions.

Motion agreed to.


POISONS AMENDMENT (INTERSTATE PRESCRIPTIONS) BILL 2025 (No. 45)

Second Reading

[11.30 a.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move -

That the bill be now read the second time.

I will start by noting the Poisons Act 1971 has been in place now for many decades. While it has served us well across its wide range of functions, including protecting the health and safety of Tasmanians, there is no doubt it is complex and somewhat unwieldy legislation. It presents many challenges in interpreting, amending and applying its provisions.

The Department of Health has commenced as comprehensive review of the Poisons Act. The government knows that it needs more than just this change, and they look forward to seeking public input as soon as possible on the new poisons act.

That is important in the context of what we consider here today - this bill to allow interstate prescribing of narcotic substances and declared restricted substances.

Mr President, barriers to accessing ADHD diagnoses and care have been the subject of significant coverage in the media and extensive inquiries both here and nationally. We have all heard many stories and many have personal experiences of these challenges and their impacts. Today, the minister for Health meets a commitment made by her predecessor in this portfolio to enable interstate prescribing of ADHD medicines, among others.

Currently, a pharmacist presented with a script issued interstate for these medicines is not legally able to dispense it. For the purpose of the act, it is not a legal script issued by somebody with the appropriate qualifications. This restriction applies to the psychostimulant medicines commonly known used to treat ADHD. It applies to opioid analgesics and to most medicinal cannabis products and to benzodiazepines - a wide range of medicines used for a wide range of conditions.

It is important to acknowledge this restriction has existed for very good reason. Many of the medicines to which it applies are drugs of dependence or drugs which are higher risk to patients or to the community at large, especially if diverted or misused.

However, the environment has changed. We have widespread availability of telehealth and electronic systems that can tell us across medical practises, pharmacies and traditional jurisdictional boundaries, a lot more about which of these high-risk medicines have been prescribed and dispensed to which patients.

The old safeguards have become out of step with the expectations of patients and the way they access care, and it too often operates as a barrier to legitimate access to appropriately prescribed medications.

It follows that this bill will increase access to medicines. The government expects this will benefit general practice and emergency departments by reducing presentations to get replacement scripts issued by local practitioners.

The government expects this will benefit patients by enabling their interstate practitioners to prescribe for them directly without requiring a partnership with a local prescriber, although of course, where such a relationship is beneficial for the patient and practitioners, they may choose to maintain it. The government heard from one residential aged care facility which engages an interstate telehealth locum service for urgent out of hours medical support due to difficulties identifying an available local option. This facility has seen avoidable hospital admissions and prolonged avoidable pain for residents due to the inability for their locum doctors interstate to urgently prescribe appropriate pain relief out of hours. This is just one example of how this bill can make a difference.

While the purpose of this bill is easily explained, the actual amendments which give rise to the necessary outcome are a little more complex. The bill defines 'interstate prescriber' and creates them as a class of 'authorised health professionals', ensuring that they have the relevant powers to prescribe under Tasmanian law.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=8.8_D=17.4_C=0.85] It also removes provisions requiring authorised health professionals, dentists, nurse practitioners, midwives and medical practitioners to be in Tasmania in order to prescribe declared restricted substances or narcotics substances.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=26.6_D=9.3_C=0.90] Another change this bill makes is to the existing restrictions around bringing these substances into the state and possessing them. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=36.9_D=26.4_C=0.85]  Currently, the act requires they are brought in on your person or in your luggage. This amendment removes that requirement. Increasing access to medicines, especially drugs of dependence, is not without risk. As a result, the government have included some important safeguards in this bill which relate to the monitored medicines database.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=63.7_D=23.9_C=0.86] Unfortunately, we do not yet have a truly national monitored medicines database with unlimited cross-border data sharing. Each jurisdiction has its own instance of a common system which contains broadly information about residents of that jurisdiction and activity that occurs in that jurisdiction. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=89.3_D=28.8_C=0.80]  Because of this, the government are specifically requiring an interstate prescriber to check TasScript when they prescribe to a Tasmanian. TasScript will tell them which monitored medicines, including narcotic substances, have been prescribed and dispensed to that patient. This is an important clinical tool for prescribers and dispensers to check the safety of a prescription in the context of a patient's other medicines [Bookmark: Phr7_O=118.4_D=4.0_C=0.78] , as well as a key safeguard against doctor shopping.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=123.0_D=14.3_C=0.84] The government are also requiring Tasmanian dispensers, pharmacists, to check the relevant interstate monitored medicines database when dispensing to those who reside outside of Tasmania. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=137.8_D=20.1_C=0.86]  Again, this will ensure that the pharmacists have access to the best available information about that patient and can use this clinical tool in their decision making. It will ensure people cannot come to Tasmania to avoid the prescription monitoring system of their home state.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=159.7_D=25.9_C=0.80] The minister recognises this at times may be frustrating for busy community pharmacists who, in the course of their activities, may have to access multiple databases. The minister is assured that work is underway nationally to progress the development of a truly national real time prescription monitoring service that will greatly simplify this process.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=186.3_D=29.4_C=0.85] The government acknowledges the Greens amendments tabled and agreed to in the other place related to the Road Safety (Alcohol and Drugs) Act 1970. Currently, driving with the detectable amount of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in your system is an offence in Tasmania under the act, but there is an exemption to this offence if the product was obtained and administered in accordance with [Bookmark: Phr12_O=215.8_D=1.1_C=0.58]  the Poisons Act. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=217.9_D=16.2_C=0.87]  The Greens amendment clarify that medicinal cannabis prescriptions issued interstate for Tasmanians are seen as being obtained in accordance with the Poisons Act. This means driving with medicinal cannabis in your system [Bookmark: Phr14_O=234.3_D=8.6_C=0.90]  should be within the exemption to the offence as long as you are not impaired or driving under the influence.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=245.1_D=14.3_C=0.87] While it would be neater to amend the road safety act, and this may be considered in the future, the government did not oppose the change in the other place. This bill clarifies the intended jurisdiction [Bookmark: Phr16_O=259.6_D=16.2_C=0.80]  of the act, specifying that it is intended to apply to interstate prescribers in relation to the writing and issuing of prescriptions of narcotics substances and restricted substances insofar as they relate to the supply [Bookmark: Phr17_O=275.9_D=29.0_C=0.81]  of such substances in Tasmania or are issued to residents of Tasmania, including operating outside the territorial limits of Tasmania in relation to these matters.

The bill also creates a head of power to make regulations in relation to issuing and dispensing scripts by interstate prescribers. This is important and the government has already drafted regulations that will give further effect to these laws and safeguards if the bill is passed. The effect of the draft regulations is essentially to require prescriptions to conform with the requirement for Tasmanian prescriptions, except where it is a prescription for an interstate patient, in which case it is exempt from that requirement.

This is important as interstate visitors are often very distressed to find that they cannot receive their usual medications from a local pharmacist on the basis of their script from their usual doctor in their home state. This can be profoundly upsetting and disruptive, impacting people with cancer unable to access their pain medicine, parents unable to access their child's ADHD medicine, and many others. These travellers must find an available appointment with a local doctor; sometimes they attend emergency departments and sometimes they simply cut their holidays short.

The government thanks those people for sharing their experiences and the minister is pleased to be doing something about it for future visitors. The government also wants to raise a note of caution: there are many issues around medicine access other than availability of interstate prescriptions. Disruptions in global medicine supply chains and surges in demand often create shortages, which we are seeing now in relation to some of the common ADHD medicines.

A local pharmacy may not necessarily have every medicine in stock in any case, especially with more uncommon medicines or doses. Members of the public should, as always, be kind and courteous to their pharmacists and their pharmacy assistants, and be understanding of the many factors that impact availability of medicine. 

Ultimately, the effect of this bill is to remove existing restrictions that apply to interstate prescriptions. In doing so it applies the Tasmanian law so that existing systems and safeguards are followed. This ensures equity between Tasmanian prescribers and those interstate. This will require education and awareness, as well as monitoring and enforcement, and the Department of Health will of course undertake this work. The bill will commence on proclamation after a short period of time to allow for appropriate education and awareness-raising and preparation for prescribers and dispensers.

The government expects that compliance will build over time as interstate prescribers become aware of the requirements in place. The Minister acknowledges the support of this bill by key stakeholders and looks forward to working together to improve and protect the health of Tasmanians into the future. I commend the bill to the House.

[11.43 p.m.]
Ms LOVELL (Rumney) - Mr President, I will make a brief contribution in support of the bill. This bill contains very sensible amendments that will go a long way to supporting people to have increased access to medications that are desperately needed. When I last held responsibility for the shadow portfolio of health some years ago, I know even then I was having people come to my office who had been caught out a bit, didn't realise that there restrictions in place and found themselves in a situation where they weren't able to access medication that was very desperately needed and left them in a real bind.

I'm pleased to see these amendments. I know this bill has been well supported. These changes are well supported by stakeholders. I also know the two categories of people, as the Leader has outlined, that will be most impacted by this bill are visitors to our state, and often I suppose - I don't know if this term is really a term that people like anymore, but the group that we would normally call 'grey nomads'. They come to Tasmania, they spend a bit of time here.

Ms Forrest - They are colloquially referred to as travellers these days.

Ms LOVELL - Travellers, thank you. I felt uncomfortable with it, so thank you, member for Murchison. Travellers that might want to spend a bit of time in Tasmania, and often people who might be in an older demographic are more likely to be on medication that they need consistently, and have probably travelled all over the country and not realised that Tasmania had this different set of rules to other states and, as the leader said, get here and then find themselves in a bit of a pickle.

The other group of people that will be impacted by this bill are largely parents of children with ADHD, and we know that with the demand on the clinics here in Tasmania for diagnosis and treatment of ADHD, that many families are relying on treatment by interstate practitioners via telehealth. These amendments will go a long way to making life easier for groups of people who have been dealing with this issue for some time.

We are happy to support the Greens amendments in the other place. I think they were maybe a bit of an oversight, maybe unnecessary in terms of this particular piece of legislation, but again, I think they provide a level of clarity that is helpful. I am pleased also to see that, as the leader pointed out, there are some important safeguards in the bill too. So, we are very happy to support this bill and I acknowledge the work of the minister and the leader to progress this through the parliament.

[11.46 a.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, the Poisons Amendment (Interstate Prescriptions) Bill, as has been alluded to by the member for Rumney, represents an eminently sensible, and some would suggest overdue, modernisation of our Tasmanian poisons legislation, and I do note there is a fuller review going on of what has become a quite a cumbersome piece of legislation due to many amendments over the years, and this is welcome.

I remember when I started my nursing training, we all had to read and study the Poisons Act to make sure we did not fall foul of it. I feel a bit sorry for the new nursing and other students of all sorts of medical fields that are required to now work their way through what is a pretty untidy piece of legislation in terms of its functionality. I will come back to that shortly. 

This bill does address practical problems that affect many Tasmanians: the inability to have certain prescriptions written by interstate doctors dispensed at a local pharmacy. It's not just people who come to the state; it is Tasmanians who have gone interstate and received interstate prescriptions, either while they were travelling or because they have seen a specialist or some other health professional who has prescribed a medication in another jurisdiction.

As the member for Rumney rightly pointed out and the leader also in her contribution, sadly, it's not an insignificant number of people that have to do that, particularly for parents of children with ADHD, and even others who have really serious and chronic pain conditions who may be seeing specialists on the mainland as well for their pain management. Often they will be prescribed opioid pain relief, medicinal cannabis, benzodiazepines, all medications that people rely on to go about their normal lives a lot of the time, and to not be aware that you may be in this jurisdiction where you can't access that medication would be really difficult.

You just sort of assume that you go to a pharmacy. I go to a pharmacy in Melbourne when I visit family over there and just assume that if I had to fill a prescription, that it would all be tickety-boo and you would not have any trouble. I also acknowledge that, because of the number of groups of medications I have just referred to do have risks associated with them, particularly the risk of diversion with opioids, et cetera, and some of the other medications that can be used for a ADHD particularly, there is need for controls, and they are there for a good reason, but it doesn't mean they should become barriers for people to access the medication they actually need.

I also acknowledge that, for a lot of patients and parents in our regional areas, the shortage of some of these really critical medications can be a real problem. We see that not only with these sorts of medications, but also others like some of those weight-loss medications. I might not know particular -

Ms Rattray - That are used for diabetics.

Ms FORREST - Well, they're supposed to be used by people who are diabetic who need the medications to stay alive, and they were being diverted to other people for the purpose of losing weight and things like that, which is, yes, an important thing for their health and wellbeing, but not actually necessary to keep them alive. We sometimes see these things happen that make really critical medicines quite short in supply. We saw that during COVID where anything related to respiratory conditions were really hard to get. Someone who has asthma, like myself, can only go and get one preventer at any one time. I understand that, but you think, gee, maybe I could just have two in case for when I go back next time and they haven't got it. That was an unusual period, but lots of medications became difficult to get at that point. It was exacerbated in our regional and quite remote areas.

This bill would allow pharmacists to dispense prescriptions issued by registered health practitioners in other Australian jurisdictions, provided these prescriptions meet the same restrictions that already apply to Tasmanian prescriptions. This is a really common-sense regulation that recognises simple reality that we live in a country with nationally registered health practitioners - and we have for a long time now. The healthcare system is increasingly operating across state boundaries and borders. It it seems extraordinary to me that we haven't done this sooner and it wasn't considered when the national regulation, AHPRA, was put in place. I think it was 2010.

The case for this is really easy to make. Fundamentally, it improves access to medicines for Tasmanians when they're travelling interstate but also access for Tasmanians who come into this state after seeing a medical specialist on the mainland. There was some data I saw recently that approximately 30 per cent of patients presenting to some urgent care clinics don't have a Tasmania-based GP at all. They rely on telehealth and other mechanisms. That's a problem in itself, so this will address that. The other thing is that it will assist people travelling to Tasmania and the member for Rumney talked about people who like to come and spend long periods of time in Tasmania, travelling around, we welcome them. If they are elderly or with a family or with a child who has ADHD, they absolutely need ongoing access to these critical medications for them.

I think as the Leader acknowledged that sometimes it's the pharmacist or the pharmacy staff who have borne the brunt of people's frustrations. Sadly, when you've got a tiny pharmacy with only one or two staff members in it, including the pharmacist, it can be pretty confronting because at that point, they're in an isolated area, there is nowhere else to go, they've probably run out, which is what usually happens. You think, damn it, I should have got that earlier, shouldn't I? 

Ms Rattray - I thought I had another sleeve in the box. 

Ms FORREST - That's right. As the Leader said, though, we should all be very respectful of our healthcare professionals, wherever they work.

The other matter was that the reform also relates to the use of telehealth which accelerated dramatically during COVID for all the reasons we understand very well, but it still remains an important part of healthcare delivery. There are some improvements that could be made. I think the federal government went a bit too hard winding back some of that, particularly in relation to medication reviews. One of my favourite pharmacists - he knows who he is - he probably won't be watching, he will be busy, but a massive bone of contention for him is that - sure, you need to do the first assessment in the patient's home - but follow-ups cannot be done by telehealth. This pharmacist covers kilometres of space, including the island to the north, King Island. It's just an inefficient system. That's not to do with this bill, but it's something that needs to be looked at by the federal government, I think that sits with. That's a matter for the federal government. It is quite a ridiculous thing when we can actually access so much of our other health care by telehealth. I'm not saying we shouldn't go into the patients' homes because you do need to see what's going on when you're doing a full medication review, and the pharmacist has obligations under that but maybe the Minister for Health can take that forward, on the pharmacists particularly.

Ms Rattray - To the meetings of ministers.

Ms FORREST - Yes. It makes so little sense to me. Every time I visit him, I get the full bottle.

As I said, telehealth has been transformative for Tasmanians living in rural and remote areas. Of course, I'm talking about a rural and remote area here, and it does provide access to specialist consultations that would otherwise be expensive, time-consuming, and possibly not a not an option for various reasons, so people go without rather than seek the help they need and then they delay that healthcare and then their problem becomes worse and the solutions are more challenging.

I want to speak briefly on the question of safety because these reforms appropriately maintain strong safeguards, as I mentioned, around high-risk medicines. The bill requires interstate prescribers to check TasScript which is our real-time prescription monitoring system, before issuing prescriptions for monitored medicines to Tasmanians and we understand why that's important because we do know that sometimes patients will doctor-shop and pharmacy-shop to try to get another repeat and another repeat. It is an important safety mechanism that was put in place some years ago now, and it also gives the the pharmacist some comfort that they're not giving something that could be quite harmful for someone if taken incorrectly. Checking on TasScript ensures that the the pharmacist can see the patient's prescription history and identify potential risks also, not just by having too much of a medication, but the risk of drug interactions as well as misuse.

Similarly, Tasmanian pharmacists dispensing interstate prescriptions for monitored medicines must check both TasScript and the originating jurisdiction's equivalent database. These cross-checking requirements provide robust protection against prescription-shopping and inappropriate prescribing while allowing legitimate access to properly prescribed medicines. Again this is a little bit extraordinary in our modern world - we don't have a single system here either. We were told in the briefing that they are working on that federally to have a single system. We were told it's couple of years away, if I'm correct. These things shouldn't be that hard if every jurisdiction's has their own, all called something slightly different, but all doing the same thing, it makes sense to have a single system where it would require one login for the pharmacist check on that patient's prescription history and relevant information related to that patient. These monitoring databases reflect the modern reality that electronic systems now provide information across traditional jurisdictional boundaries that weren't available in 1971, obviously, when the Poisons Act first came into being.

I value nothing more than getting a prescription on my phone because I'm never in the right place when you want it, if it's a paper one. I'm very grateful to my GP for always sending them to my phone and to the pharmacist for sending them back to my phone when they're repeats. It makes it so much easier. The old safeguard of restricting interstate prescriptions has become out of step with both patient expectations, as the Leader said, and the technological capabilities available to protect public health and safety.

I note that the bill makes the clarification in relation to the Road Safety (Alcohol and Drugs) Act and the Leader did speak to that amendment that was inserted by the Greens. I believe that's sensible. I note from the Leader's comments that it probably sits more correctly in the the Road Safety (Alcohol and Drugs) Act 1970, and I would hope that in the review of the Poisons Act, this will also be something that has taken up and put into the Road Safety (Alcohol and Drugs) Act because if someone falls foul of the Road Safety (Drug and Alcohol) Act, it makes sense for that defence to be there in my mind. I understand the reasons for putting it here right now for the government not opposing that, but I hope that it would eventually end up in the Road Safety (Drug and Alcohol) Act where I believe it does more rightly belong because that's the act you're being charged under if you're being charged. Obviously, if you're being impaired by it or you don't have a prescription for the medication that you have in your body when you're driving but not impaired, then clearly it should be in the same legislation.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=18.3_D=19.9_C=0.77] I acknowledge that the Poisons Act is complex and unwieldy and does require extensive review. This bill is only targeted to fix the immediate problem and wholesale reform will follow. I do look forward to that. It [Bookmark: Phr3_O=38.8_D=4.4_C=0.86]  will be helpful to many people, particularly those health practitioners who have [Bookmark: Phr4_O=43.5_D=7.3_C=0.67]  to abide by it. I am not sure what the timeframe is that for Leader, if there is an actual time frame to see that done [Bookmark: Phr5_O=53.0_D=22.4_C=0.77] , but appreciate it will be quite the body of work and take some time in consultation to ensure it's done well.

That said, we should not let the perfect be the enemy of good. This bill addresses the real problems affecting real Tasmanians right now and there is no reason to delay sensible improvements while waiting for broader reforms.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=76.3_D=8.5_C=0.86] Several important implementation questions were raised during consultation, particularly on resourcing for monitoring and enforcement of the new provisions. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=85.5_D=10.7_C=0.81]  I trust the government will ensure adequate resources are provided to support effective implementation, including the public awareness piece, not just for the [Bookmark: Phr8_O=98.0_D=18.2_C=0.70]  pharmacists, the prescribers and the dispensers, but also for the people.

Ms Rattray - Community.

Ms FORREST - Yes, also community. It is the general expectation anyway so they probably think I didn't know we couldn't already do that. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners raised legitimate concerns [Bookmark: Phr9_O=116.5_D=26.2_C=0.77]  about monitoring enforcement, and I will encourage the government to work closely with prescribers and pharmacists as the new system is implemented to ensure it's seamless.

This bill is fundamentally about removing unnecessary barriers to legitimate healthcare access while maintaining appropriate standards around high-risk medicines. It recognises we live in a country with nationally registered health practitioners and a healthcare system that increasingly operates across state borders [Bookmark: Phr10_O=143.6_D=1.8_C=0.84]  with elements of electronic access. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=146.6_D=25.8_C=0.78]  It acknowledges that reality of modern healthcare delivery and we should be moving with that rather than lagging behind. It does provide a practical solution to problems Tasmanians or visitors to Tasmania can face every day. We are talking about medications here for some that are lifesaving or life preserving and critical to the health and well-being.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=173.0_D=7.4_C=0.76] I am confident the legislation has the appropriate safety measures and strong support from health professionals and patient groups. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=182.0_D=22.0_C=0.73]  It is the sort of practical evidence-based reform that improves people's lives without creating unnecessary risk or bureaucracy, other than the requirement for pharmacists to log in. Once they've done that, the problem is they have to log into every jurisdiction. You have two people arrive the same day, one from Victoria and one from New South Wales, that's two periods of time you have to log in or go through the process. Hopefully, that will be resolved in a couple of years to reduce that time with a national system that manages that. I support the bill.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=218.6_D=4.4_C=0.75] [12.03 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) [Bookmark: Phr16_O=263.9_D=23.3_C=0.84]  - Mr President, I have a number of answers to questions that were raised particularly by the member for Murchison and, and I appreciate the support that appears to be in the Chamber today. It is much appreciated.

The member for Murchison, the question on telehealth access for [Bookmark: Phr17_O=288.0_D=4.4_C=0.88]  medication reviews. As the member said, this is a matter for the Commonwealth government [Bookmark: Phr18_O=292.9_D=12.1_C=0.83]  and the government supports flexible access to healthcare, including through telehealth. I expect that it will be something raised when the minister meets with her counterparts and the federal health minister.

Another question was: why are multiple real-time prescriptions monitoring system sign up and checks required? Unfortunately, the national real time prescription monitoring system does not yet share information across borders on all prescribing and dispensing transactions, although, all jurisdictions have passed consistent legislation for the national system. The information technology in place is not fully integrated between states and territories and this is a matter for the National Digital Health Agency, which is under national discussion, another one for their agenda. The checking TasScript before prescribing for a Tasmanian, or checking an interstate database before dispensing to an interstate patient will help to ensure the safeguards of real-time prescription monitoring apply across borders and maximise the information available to support clinical decision making.

Another one asked by the member for Murchison was about the issues with the Poisons Act or Poisons Regulations. The Department of Health has commenced a comprehensive review and a rewrite of the Poisons Act and regulations. Extensive public consultation will be undertaken during 2026. Prior to public consultation, people can contact the office of the Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing or the Department of Health with any issues they wish to raise. It is possibly the two-year period you actually mentioned, member, before we see something in the parliament.

What support will be available to prescribers and pharmacists to implement this? During a short implementation period before the changes commenced the Department of Health will work with professional organisations to communicate key information. Supporting information will be made available on the Department of Health website on an ongoing basis. The Pharmaceutical Services Branch can also be contacted for assistance. Each jurisdiction provides technical support for its real-time prescription monitoring system.

In relation to the question around driving while using medicinal cannabis; it's important to state that it is primarily a matter for the Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Management, who is responsible for the Road Safety (Alcohol and Drugs) Act 1970. The honourable member also said it possibly did belong there, but we've got it here.

Ms Forrest - Hopefully they will talk to each other.

Ms RATTRAY - Well, I would like to think that they would talk to each other and I'm sure the department will be going to have those conversations. Medicinal cannabis can cause impairment and affect fitness to drive and it is recommended patients do not drive while being treated with medicinal cannabis. A person who drives a vehicle while under the influence of a drug, to the extent that the person is incapable of having proper control of the vehicle, is guilty of an offence, even if the drug is prescribed. Even if it is prescribed and you're not in control, don't do it. Driving with any detectable amount of THC in your system is also an offence in Tasmania under the road safety act, unless the product was obtained and administered in accordance with the Poisons Act. The extent of liability for a driving offence always depends on the individual circumstances. However, the proposed changes, including the amendments made in the other place, as moved by our Greens colleagues there - I thought it was Prof Razay, was that the one before?

Ms O'Connor - No, it was Cecily Rosol.

Ms RATTRAY - Oh, it was Cecily Rosol. It was the Greens.

Ms O'Connor - This is the road safety amendment?

Ms RATTRAY - It was the one before. We've been through quite a few bills already today, Mr President, we're doing really well.

Ms Forrest - Don't get too excited.

Ms RATTRAY - I would never do that.

I will start that again. However, the proposed changes, including the amendments made in the other place as moved by our Greens colleagues there, will bring medicinal cannabis prescribed and/or dispensed interstate for Tasmanians, within the remit of the Poisons Act and therefore within the scope of the exemption, as long as the driver is not impaired. So, just reinforcing that statement: we don't want people in our communities to think that it's a free-for-all. They need to be responsible.

COMMISSION FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE BILL 2025 (No. 54)

Second Reading

[12.13 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move -

That the bill be now read the second time.

The government has committed to implementing all 191 recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings. A critical reform was the recommendation to establish a Commission for Children and Young People. The Commission for Children and Young People Bill 2025 fulfils this commitment. It will create three new statutory roles in the new commission: a Commissioner for Children and Young People, a Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People and a Child Advocate. The existing Independent Regulator, who oversees Tasmanian organisations to comply with the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Framework, will be part of the commission. The bill is the product of a whole-of-government approach with extensive community consultation.

The departments of Premier and Cabinet, Justice, Education, and Children and Young people worked closely together. The Commissioner for Children and Young People and the Independent Regulator were closely consulted throughout drafting. The government undertook an extensive public consultation on a draft bill for three months from September 2024. The final bill has been amended and improved significantly from the consultation draft.

There were 14 targeted consultation sessions with key stakeholder groups, including: children and young people; Aboriginal organisations and people; victim-survivors; and foster and kinship carers, including Tasmanian government agencies. 31 written submissions were also received. Submissions and a 'what we heard report' on face-to-face consultations were published in April this year. The feedback received was detailed and constructive and I thank all stakeholders who have contributed to this important process. There was overwhelming support for an enhanced Commission for Children and Young People.

How the new commission will operate: it is important to be clear about what the new commission will be expected and empowered to do. As the commission of inquiry, or COI, noted, this new commission will not be a general complaint-handling or investigation body. However, the CEO also considered that after a transition period, the same person would fill both the roles of Commissioner for Children and Young People and the Independent Regulator. This would embed the investigative functions of the Independent Regulator under the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Act 2023 within the commission.

The COI wrote that as the successor to the current Commissioner for Children and Young People, the new commission will have the benefit of being known to Tasmanian children and families as an organisation that can help with concerns relating to children and young people. It will ensure there is one oversight body in Tasmania with a focus on their safety and wellbeing. The COI considered this takes account of Tasmania's relatively small size and the need for regulation to be effective and efficient.

I will first walk through how the commission will work. The new Commissioner for Children and Young People will be the head of agency for the purposes of administration of the commission as a state service agency, and will be the first of the three new commissioners appointed. As a state service agency, the commission will be able to manage its staff and finances directly rather than through a department. One person will be ultimately appointed as both Commissioner for Children and Young People under the bill and Independent Regulator under the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Act.

This will follow a transition period during which two different people hold each of these roles. The transition period is expected to be up to three years after commencement of the act, as the current Independent Regulator's term of appointment expires on 24 January 2029. The Independent Regulator's functions and powers remain in the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Act. The Commissioner for Children and Young People, Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People and Child Advocate will have both specific functions and powers relevant to their office and shared general powers of the commission.

The functions: The bill sets out several principles to be applied when a person is performing a function or exercising a power under the bill. The paramount consideration is the well-being and best interest of children and young people. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=15.4_D=4.4_C=0.91]  As a result of consultation, the final bill [Bookmark: Phr3_O=21.6_D=22.3_C=0.87]  expressly states this paramount consideration is reflected in, but is not limited to, the rights and principles specified under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=44.3_D=29.8_C=0.84] It also states that relevant provisions of those documents are to be taken into account when performing a function or exercising a power. The commission's general functions will include making recommendations to government on system improvements, conducting inquiries into systemic issues and advocacy for all, or a class of children and young people, further promoting safety and well-being rights [Bookmark: Phr5_O=74.3_D=21.6_C=0.79]  and participation and monitoring and reviewing well-being care and treatment of children and young people in out of home care or the youth justice system, the use of isolation, force restraints and searches, serious incidents and electronic surveillance.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=105.1_D=27.6_C=0.84] The Child Advocate and Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People have exclusive powers and functions regarding the advocacy for an individual child or young person. The bill will require the Child Advocate to establish and administer an independent visitor scheme regarding children and young people in detention and out of home care. The Child Advocate must consult with the Commissioner [Bookmark: Phr7_O=133.6_D=1.8_C=0.89]  for Aboriginal Children and Young People [Bookmark: Phr8_O=135.7_D=24.6_C=0.84]  about how that applies to Aboriginal children and Aboriginal young people.

Both commissioners will be empowered to appoint independent visitors. Each of the three commissioners is taken to be an independent visitor under the scheme. The bill creates those powers but does not establish the scheme itself, the COI [Bookmark: Phr9_O=161.4_D=4.7_C=0.77]  scheduled date for completion for the scheme is July 2029.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=167.0_D=24.2_C=0.85] The bill does not contain coercive powers of entry to residences or premises regarding the out of home care system. I anticipate the independent visitor scheme, when established, will include strong but measured considered powers regarding access to and oversight of children and young people in out of home care.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=193.3_D=29.0_C=0.83] I also expect this will occur with appropriate community consultation and input from the commission. The Child Advocate has further functions and powers which include helping a child or young person, in appropriate circumstances, to make a complaint or even to make that complaint, as proxy to a statutory complaint's authority. That means a person or entity, including an agency with [Bookmark: Phr12_O=222.8_D=13.5_C=0.78]  a legislated function or power to determine complaints or review decisions. This is an expansion of the COI recommendation about assisting with the complaints to the Ombudsman.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=237.2_D=18.7_C=0.84] The Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People have similar functions and powers of the Child Advocate in respect of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. An Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person is to be appointed to this commissioner's position. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=256.5_D=16.8_C=0.86] 

The powers - the commission's general powers, include requiring information and data for the purposes of maintaining information regarding Tasmanian children and identifying and monitoring trends relating to them. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=275.4_D=25.9_C=0.83]  It has systemic investigations, inquiry and review powers. It does not inquire into specific decisions, complaints or circumstances regarding an individual, child or young person. However, it can investigate or review a systemic matter that arises as a result of a matter raised about an individual. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=301.7_D=3.3_C=0.81]  It can also hold an inquiry into a matter raised in respect of an individual if that is commenced by the Child Advocate or Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People. These mechanisms allow the commission to examine services and provide recommendations to government through the reports tabled in parliament.

The bill gives the commission power to access, inspect and review a detention facility without warrant. This is not intended to match the extent of the powers of the Custodial Inspector or the National Preventative Mechanism, because the commission is essentially an advisory and reporting body. There is ongoing work to consider the different approaches recommended by the COI and former Ombudsman, Mr Connock in relation to the powers of the Custodial Inspector and National Preventive Mechanism regarding children and young people. The relevant COI recommendations in this area are 12.38 and 12.39 and will progress by 1 July 2026 as scheduled. They are not expected to require amendments to this bill, but amendments to the Custodial Inspector and National Preventative Mechanism Legislation may be required.

The bill's inspection powers allow general access during the ordinary business hours of a detention facility or as agreed between the commissioner and person in charge of the facility. They can occur with or without notice. There is power to take photographs, files or audio or visual recordings. It is an offence for a person in charge of a detention facility to unreasonably refuse a commissioner access.

However, the commissioner has access to a resident child, young person or person with care or charge of a child in a detention facility at any time to monitor the safety and well-being of the resident.

A person in charge of a detention facility, a member of staff or a person providing services at the detention facility commits an offence if they do not allow a commissioner to interview a resident in private or allow an interpreter to accompany the commissioner for that purpose. Written communications between the resident and the commissioner are also protected.

Important definitions:

The bill contains definitions which have been significantly strengthened since the consultation draft. A child is a person under the age of 18. The term young person ensures that the commission can undertake its functions in relation to a particularly vulnerable cohort of young people between the ages of 18 and 20, in addition to all children under 18. This covers young people who have been involved in the youth justice system at any time.

The tabled bill also included 18- to 20-year-olds if they have been in out of home care after they were 15 or above, given that group also has higher needs for transition.

The latter scenario was expanded through an amendment in the other place, so the definition of young person applies to young people aged 18, 19 or 20 who have ever been in out of home care.

Out of home care is also defined to cover a range of orders or statutory powers under the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1997 and some under the Adoption Act 1988. This gives certainty to the Commission's jurisdiction.

There is a collection of definitions regarding detention.

'Detention facility' has a broad definition to cover detention centres, prisons holding children or young people, various police facilities including stations, vehicles and watch houses and courts. This covers people on remand or people under sentence. Other terms 'facility resident' and 'resident' round this out to cover someone with a child of their own in detention there because of those parents' circumstances.

The bill applies to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in two different ways. Children and young people need only self-identify or be recognised as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people to access the assistance of the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People. Such children would mostly self-identify, while the commissioner can also support very young children or children with communication needs who can't self-identify but who are recognised as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander children. For instance, this may be the recognition of a parent or relative or persons in this community. The bill also defines the phrase 'a person known to be an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.' This definition applies to the appointment of adults to the positions created by the bill. These include the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People, an independent visitor appointed to visit Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander children, and the majority of selection panel members appointing the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People. These persons must be of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, identify as such, and be accepted as such by a recognised Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander organisation. This reflects the definition and test as recently passed by parliament in the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Act 2023.

The bill also makes clear that using the word 'Aboriginal' in reference to a child or young person is taken to include a reference to a Torres Strait Islander too. Each commissioner in the new commission, when providing services to children, will be bound by the Child and Youth Safe Standards and the universal principle in the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Act. That means the commission must provide an environment that respects the right to cultural safety of children who identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. Appointment requirements for commissioners reflect the COI recommendations. These include a transparent process, compliance with best practice for merit-based recruitment, and a selection panel with at least one non-government employee and, if appropriate, at least one young person. A panel of children and young people must also be consulted for its views and opinions regarding selection of the commissioner and determining the best process for selection.

The selection process for the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People also requires the majority of the selection panel be known to be Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. Before making a recommendation to the Governor regarding appointing a commissioner, the minister is to consult with at least one representative of each political party that then has two or more sitting members in parliament. A further requirement was added via amendment in the other place, expanding the minister's consultation requirements to include consulting with the Joint Standing Committee - that's if its members have been appointed at the time. The amendment was drafted so that if the committee's members have not been appointed, then this requirement does not apply.

Information management: The bill's information management provisions were significantly redrafted after consultation, to clarify and improve them. The bill requires the commission to protect the identity of a child or young person as far as it is practicable. There is express guidance on commissioners sharing information with the commission to ensure information privacy. The commission may request information from persons and specified bodies. When necessary, the commission can also compel the provision of information. A group of government and statutory bodies who have their own information management powers and responsibilities defined as 'relevant authorities', are not subject to this power. An example is the Integrity Commission.

There are further safeguards which the commission must consider before compelling identifying information. It is an offence not to comply with the requirement to provide information unless a listed exemption applies. The Magistrates Court may make an order requiring compliance with the commission's requirements. The bill provides for the commission's ability to disclose or refer information under specified criteria and for confidentiality of information obtained under the bill. The bill improves upon the consultation version by using a more targeted exemption to the Personal Information Protection Act 2004 which maintains personal information protection obligations, where possible.

By consequential amendment to the Right to Information Act 2009, the bill adds the Commission and each commissioner as 'excluded persons' or 'bodies', so that the act only applies to information about the commission's administration. This is consistent with the current Commissioner for Children and Young People.

The Timeframe to Establish the Commission: The COI acknowledged it would take some time to fully establish the new commission. The COI provided a time frame of 1 July 2024, however, work on the bill found that this timeframe did not allow for the significance and complexity of this reform. Consistent with the COI's recommendations and timelines, the full implementation of the bill will take place in phases. The first phase on commencement of the bill is the establishment of the commission and appointment of the new Commissioner for Children and Young People. The second phase includes appointing the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People and the Child Advocate. These appointments are due by July 2026. Establishing the Independent Visitor Scheme is due by July 2029. As I've mentioned, one person will ultimately be appointed as both the Commissioner for Children and Young People and the Independent Regulator. The bill manages these steps by being drafted in a way that allows the relevant sections to be commenced by proclamation of the Governor at later dates.

Independence: The bill has multiple provisions designed to ensure the independence of the commission and each commissioner. Each may perform the functions and exercise the powers of the commission. If one commissioner performs a function or exercises a power, this does not stop another commissioner or the commission from performing that function or exercising that power. The commission and each commissioner are not subject to the direction or control of the minister or any minister. The commission and each commissioner must act independently, impartially and in the public interest. When doing so, a commissioner is not subject to the direction or control of any other commissioner nor to the State Service Act 2000 in respect of the statutory function or power. The minister administering will have a power to request that the commission conduct an inquiry which can include an inquiry outside the commission's usual jurisdiction. This reflects a power regarding investigations or reviews under the current act. However, the bill gives the commission discretion to refuse this request, preserving its independence.

Oversight: The bill also has appropriate oversight mechanisms. If the commission is satisfied that a function or power is able to be performed or exercised by a specific commissioner without a conflict of interest being present, the commission may authorise another commissioner, if appropriate, to perform that function or exercise that power. Provisions regarding the commission's administration cover annual reporting requirements. These include summaries of any inquiries, a list of published reports and a forward-looking annual plan describing the proposed program of work and activities as known for that financial year, this must be tabled in each House of parliament. There is discretion to at any timetable other relevant reports in each House of parliament, or provide them to the minister, Joint Committee or to publish reports.

The bill creates a new joint Standing Committee on the Commission for Children and Young People. This is based on the Integrity Commission Act 2009 and its Joint Standing Committee on Integrity. This new commission is so different in purpose and function; with its child centred focus that it justifies a new committee being established. The bill preserves the Children and Young People Advisory Council and Children and Young People Consultative Council, created under the existing Commissioner for Children and Young People Act 2016. The Child Advocate must establish an advisory group in relation to children in out of home care and the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People must establish an advisory group in relation to Aboriginal children and young people. There are broad discretionary powers to establish other committees or advisory groups to determine their terms of reference and to consult with the committee or advisory group, in respect of the proposed terms of reference. The Joint Standing Committee is to review the functions, powers and operations of the commission and each commissioner, and table its report as soon as practicable, after the third anniversary of the commencement of the relevant provisions.

Second, a statutory review is to occur in respect of the five-year period commencing on the first appointment of a commissioner under the act. The bill requires the commission to liaise with other relevant statutory authorities, statutory officers and official bodies when conducting an inquiry or investigation. One purpose of this is to prevent, if appropriate, duplicate inquiries or investigations. Another purpose is to facilitate the coordination and resourcing of inquiries or investigations into matters that are to be conducted separately, hence concurrent matters are not entirely ruled out. The same provision also requires the commission to take certain actions if it becomes aware that a child or young person has sought assistance from another of its counterparts in that cohort. It must take all reasonable steps to avoid unnecessary duplication of assistance, while facilitating the provision of support and assistance in respect of that matter. There are general offence provisions around protection, from reprisals for persons providing information to the commission and protection from liability for those acting in good-faith.

The bill effectively combines four different statutory officers into one new commission. It is the product of sustained effort to honour the COI recommendations and improve on a consultation version, thanks to the detailed input of many and varied stakeholders.

I'd like to thank everyone who has contributed to this bill, particularly those who wrote the second reading speech, and a tremendous step forward in the shared purpose of the government, this parliament and the community at large, to make Tasmanian children safer.

I commend the bill to the Council.

Mr HISCUTT (Montgomery) - Mr President, I rise briefly to speak on this bill. The Leader has eloquently explained the purposes and reasons of the bills and its intent. I won't speak too long on them as they are well supported. I will take the time to say I appreciate the amount of consultation the government has partaken with in this bill, and it's quite commendable. The revision number in the bill reflects that.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.8_D=5.7_C=0.72] Giving young people a voice in Tasmania is important, especially those who are more vulnerable [Bookmark: Phr3_O=33.7_D=6.5_C=0.70] , but it also gives children a choice in that advocacy. It's inclusion of Aboriginal Youth Commissioner is also admirable.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=40.8_D=19.2_C=0.82]  I stand to speak on a procedural matter with the bill and to foreshadow I will be moving an amendment that will be circulated in the House in regard to part 4, Joint Standing Committee. This sets the establishment of a parliamentary committee, which is appropriate. However, section 3 dictates that any [Bookmark: Phr5_O=61.3_D=21.6_C=0.84]  party with a membership greater than three must be included on that committee. This could cause conflict with our practises in this House, as it could force a member to be elected in an undemocratic way. My amendment allows for the other place to choose as they please and for us to continue our practises. This will bring it in line with the Integrity Committee, which has been used previously. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=83.8_D=11.7_C=0.79]  I am under the understanding this was the intention of the bill and would appreciate the government's comments on this. I hope the passage of this bill goes smoothly with the foreshadowed amendment. Thank you.

[12.47 p.m.]
 Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - [Bookmark: Phr7_O=96.7_D=6.7_C=0.68]  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=113.3_D=1.5_C=0.91]  Mr [Bookmark: Phr9_O=116.8_D=25.2_C=0.83]  President, what a good day it is in this place, to have before us the Commission for Children and Young People Bill of 2025, a bill that fulfils the recommendations of the commission of inquiry, either in full or significantly in part. I want to acknowledge [Bookmark: Phr10_O=142.8_D=2.8_C=0.91]  not only the courage of victim/survivors [Bookmark: Phr11_O=146.3_D=26.2_C=0.82]  and whistleblowers who came forward and went through the extraordinarily traumatising process of giving evidence to the commission of inquiry, I also want to thank the commission of inquiry again for the thoroughness and the empathy they poured into their extremely important work. I also want to acknowledge that [Bookmark: Phr12_O=173.5_D=1.6_C=0.80]  the Tasmanian government [Bookmark: Phr13_O=175.5_D=24.6_C=0.85]  has held true in very significant part to its commitment to implementing all 191 recommendations of the commission of inquiry.

There are questions about whether or not the implementation of those recommendations is adequately funded in this interim budget and what will happen to the funding that's required from May next  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=200.9_D=4.4_C=0.89] year, but it is unarguable that significant [Bookmark: Phr15_O=206.2_D=28.1_C=0.87]  dedication and resources within government have been dedicated to establishing this commission. As I understand it, the version of the bill that we're debating today is version 21 which is a very good indication that the government on this was prepared to listen very closely to stakeholder input and input from [Bookmark: Phr16_O=235.1_D=1.6_C=0.71]  the interim Commissioner for Children and [Bookmark: Phr17_O=237.0_D=23.9_C=0.89]  Young People input from the Office of the Independent Regulator.

The bill that is before us now is a massive reform in the way we respond to the rights and the needs of children and young people in Tasmania. In so doing, we should acknowledge [Bookmark: Phr18_O=261.5_D=3.5_C=0.81]  our history on this island of harming children [Bookmark: Phr19_O=266.9_D=2.5_C=0.68]  began on colonisati [Bookmark: Phr20_O=270.5_D=10.0_C=0.88] on. Ashley Youth Detention Centre for more than 100 years has been harming and traumatising children and young people [Bookmark: Phr21_O=281.0_D=22.6_C=0.84] . It is still open, despite the recommendation of the commission of inquiry that it be closed immediately. Despite the promise of a former premier who gave a solemn commitment that Ashley would be closed by September of 2024, and yet that hellhole remains open, [Bookmark: Phr22_O=304.7_D=0.3_C=0.81]  but that is an ongoing debate and it is certainly something, I'm sure, that government will need to answer for next week in budget Estimates. I do note there is funding allocated in this interim budget for the new therapeutic youth justice facility at Pontville, and that is a good thing, but it does seem that the process of closing Ashley and establishing a new youth justice facility has been glacially slow.

The Commission for Children and Young People Bill we debate today fulfils the government's commitment to implement the recommendations of the commission of inquiry. It creates three new statutory roles: the Commissioner for Children and Young People, the Commissioner for Aboriginal Children and Young People, and the Child Advocate. It allows for the fact that we have an established statutory role in the Office of the Independent Regulator and provides for those roles to come together within four or five years, as I recall.

The task of the commission will be enormous: to advocate for systemic change in the way that we treat children and young people, particularly children and young people in out-of-home care or in youth detention. We have before us the annual report of the Office of the Independent Regulator and, I'm sure, a number of honourable members have worked through this first Office of the Independent Regulator comprehensive annual report. Some low points from the annual report: the Office of the Independent Regulator received 567 notifications in 2024-2025 under the reportable conduct scheme, and that was an average of 12 a week compared to 9 a week in the previous reporting period, which was 1 January 2024 to 30 June 2024.

At the end of the 2024-25 financial year, 452 reportable conduct notifications remain open. Of the 304 reportable conduct notifications that were closed in the 2024-25 financial year, 34 were found to be substantiated. That's one in 10: one in 10. So, if you look at sectors with the most notifications, and I am sure the Minister of Education, Children and Young People is very concerned about this as well, the report says on page 10:[tbc]

In line with other jurisdictions, education, (which includes public and private schools, early childhood education and tertiary education), continues to account for the largest number of notifications, with 189 in this fiscal period, equating to a third of the total received, (or 33 per cent). Available data suggests less than 1 per cent of students in Tasmanian schools were victims in a reportable conduct notification.

We can say less than 1 per cent, and it sounds like a small number, but it's certainly not a small number, and by no means trivial or insignificant, in fact, the opposite for any child who has been harmed in an educational setting. 

In 2024, there were 80,649 children and young people enrolled in Tasmanian schools (including in Government, Catholic and Independent).

In the 2024-25 financial year there were 210 children and young people in the education sector that were the alleged victim in a reportable conduct notification to the OIR. Six of these children and young people (3%) were alleged victims in more than one reportable conduct notification. 

I will just pause at this moment to acknowledge that the parliament has passed legislation to require organisations to be child safe and to enact this reportable conduct scheme, and it is through this scheme that, to some level, we are seeing the extent of the problem. I want to indicate that we will be supporting this bill as it is. We believe it's been fully considered and broadly consulted. We won't be supporting the proposed amendment put forward by the honourable member for Montgomery, because it is potentially quite a backward step in terms of the composition of the very important oversight committee that will be established under this legislation. That committee, in the provisions of part 4 of this act:[tbc]

The Joint Committee would consist of an even number that is not less than six and not more than eight members of Parliament, of whom half are to be members of the Legislative Council and half are to be members of the House of Assembly.

And the provision goes on to say:

The members of the Joint Committee established by this section are to include at least one representative of each political party that has three or more members in the House of Assembly.

Now I understand the member for Montgomery in his amendment seeks to bring the provision for this committee in line with the Integrity Commission Act, but I would argue that that provision in the Integrity Commission Act, in its establishment of the committee, is somewhat flawed in itself.

If we were to pass, for example, the honourable member for Montgomery's amendment, it would mean if the committee is established as a committee of six, for example, no independent member in the lower house would be able to put their hand forward because an amendment would have been passed that required every party member who was passionate about protecting the wellbeing of children in Tasmania would need to come from the House of Assembly. 

You would have half your committee established from party membership in the House of Assembly, that is: there would be one Liberal, one Labor, one Green, under the current make-up of that House, and therefore six members of the crossbench would be excluded from putting their hand forward. There are members of this place who are members of political parties, and I am one of them, who have been on this journey of understanding the need and pressing for a commission of inquiry into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. They have worked very closely with victim-survivors and whistleblowers. They have attended commission of inquiry hearings.

I don't mean to speak for other members of this place, but I know there are other party members in this place who are just as passionate as I am, agreeing about making sure we get this right, and we make that turn away from our history of damaging and brutalising children; but should the honourable member for Montgomery's amendment pass, arguably members of this place who are passionate about the wellbeing of children could be excluded on the basis of the fact that we're a member of a political party, and there are already members on the committee from the House who are members of a political party.

I really think, notwithstanding the conventions of this place, we should be agnostic about which House statutorily is required to provide those members who happen to be members of a political party with three or more members in the House of Assembly. I think it would be a backward step for the constitution of this very important committee, and we won't be supporting it.

Mr President, while I'm on my feet, as a member of the joint committee that has oversight of the implementation of the commission of inquiry recommendations, I will say how meaningful it has been to be a member of that committee, previously chaired by the honourable member for Murchison and now chaired by the honourable member for Nelson. I believe we've done a very thorough job.
