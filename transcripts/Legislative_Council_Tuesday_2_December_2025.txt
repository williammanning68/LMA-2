MOTION

Amending Motions 18, 19 and 20

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=118.3_D=3.4_C=0.85] [11.02 a.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) -  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=124.0_D=4.4_C=0.82]  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=129.0_D=1.5_C=0.33]  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=132.2_D=25.5_C=0.74] Mr President, pursuant to Standing Order 53(8), I'm delivering to the Table three amended motions. These amended notices replace notices of motion 18, 19 and 20 on the notice paper for today's order of business. I previously circulated to members by email marked-up versions of these amended notices of motion which illustrate where the terms of the notices have been altered.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=158.6_D=5.3_C=0.63] I've sought advice from the Clerks, and they advise that this is the course of action most appropriate, as the nature of the alterations  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=164.2_D=19.0_C=0.62] made by these amended notices are such that they do not differ materially from the terms of my original notices. This also does not impact on me being able to move these motions today. When I move these motions, it will be in the amended terms. Hard copies of the amended notices have been circulated to members in the Chamber for their reference.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=192.7_D=4.5_C=0.87] Mr PRESIDENT - Are there any further notices of motion? The honourable Member for Hobart [Bookmark: Phr16_O=198.6_D=29.2_C=0.78]  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=228.0_D=29.3_C=0.72]  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=257.7_D=25.3_C=0.76]  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=284.0_D=4.2_C=0.59]  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=289.2_D=14.4_C=0.76]  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=304.4_D=0.6_C=0.47] .


QUESTIONS ON NOTICE - ANSWERS

No. 2 - Plan to Address Youth Offending
[11.06 a.m.]

 [Bookmark: _Hlk215652764] The following answer to a question on notice was given.

Ms THOMAS question to LEADER for the GOVERMENT in the LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Ms RATTRAY.

ANSWER

Will the Government develop a plan to address youth offending?

Our government remains committed to redesigning the Youth Justice System to provide for better outcomes for young people and ensuring safe communities.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=50.9_D=2.4_C=0.82]  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=64.1_D=28.1_C=0.89] They will work to continue to focus efforts on stopping young people offending and diverting young people from the Youth Justice System. Tasmanian Government is delivering on its commitment to reform the Tasmanian Youth Justice System.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=92.4_D=29.8_C=0.81] Youth Justice Blueprint 2024 to 2034 provides the clear pathway to achieve successful reform. Also, the Youth Justice Diversionary Services Framework sets out requirements for funded diversionary services in Tasmania aligned to the Youth Justice Model of Care, contemporary evidence and best practice.

Through the 2025-26 Budget, funding of $1.6 million over 3 years has been allocated to build  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=122.5_D=30.0_C=0.82] Youth Justice workforce capability The government is committed to closing the Ashley Youth Detention Centre as soon as possible and developing a new facility based on therapeutic rights based and child focus model of care. To deliver on this commitment, a total of $155.3 million is allocated to building the youth justice facility in the south of the state at Pontville. The new youth justice facility at Pontville is being designed to deliver a child [Bookmark: Phr10_O=152.5_D=28.7_C=0.81]  centred and therapeutic model of care that addresses the individual needs and risk factors of young offenders while keeping the community safe.

The commitment to a proactive Tasmanian Police presence on the beat in Glenorchy, Claremont and Moonah. This is an operational matter for Tasmania Police and dependent upon available resources noting other competing demands in the community. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=181.6_D=16.2_C=0.74]  Continuing task force activity is not always sustainable but is an option for local managers to consider if it is deemed necessary and achievable.

Recently, Tasmanian Police stepped up its focus on reducing anti-social behaviour  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=198.0_D=16.6_C=0.79] and retail crime in the Glenorchy Municipality launching Taskforce Respect, a community campaign involving high visibility patrols in the CBD and shopping areas. Taskforce Respect also covers the Moonah and Claremont areas.
 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=215.1_D=15.5_C=0.78] Tasmanian Police continues to work in partnership with Glenorchy City Council, businesses and stakeholders such as Metro Tasmania to prevent, resolve and investigate issues of crime and anti-social behaviour that occur in public spaces.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=232.0_D=28.9_C=0.83] Question B on urgent legislative change. Tasmania's framework, under the Security and Investigations Agents Act 2002 and associated licencing and training requirements, is designed to provide an appropriate balance between maintaining public safety and ensuring that the use of coercive powers remains within the remit of police and authorised officers. The government will consider any  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=261.1_D=27.4_C=0.82] specific proposals put forward for legislative amendments.

Question C on the increased investment in surveillance technology, including CCTV monitoring systems. In September 2024, a collaboration between the City of Hobart and Tasmanian Police saw the installation of a portal at the Hobart Police Station allowing officers to directly access  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=289.3_D=1.0_C=0.82] CCTV footage  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=290.7_D=14.3_C=0.89] from about 330 camera views within the Hobart municipality. This has been a successful tool for managing active incidents and extracting evidence after an event, as well as guiding officers on the beat and monitoring the welfare of individuals. Tasmania Police is an end user of the private/public CCTV. However, a central CCTV monitoring system and 24/7 security monitoring would be a matter for local government. 

In answer to question D, regarding a review of sentencing and diversion program outcomes under the Youth Justice Act of 1997 to evaluate whether they are meeting the needs and expectations of the community, victims and young people, the Tasmanian government is actively working to deliver a youth justice system that supports the diversion of children and young people from offending and risk-taking behaviours, with a comprehensive review of the Youth Justice Act of 1997 underway.

The review of the act will ensure that it is updated to reflect a contemporary youth justice system in line with the Youth Justice Blueprint of 2024-2034, including increases to the minimum age of criminal responsibility and detention. The objective of the act review is to support a contemporary best-practice youth justice model in Tasmania to ensure children and young people engaging in harmful behaviours and offending are supported in a manner that best promotes their safety, wellbeing and rights, encourages positive social development and strengthens protective factors, greater community safety by embedding responses that are evidence-based and aimed at addressing the root causes of harmful behaviour, and meeting identified needs. The legislative framework is more user-friendly, easy to administer and is fit for purpose. 

The Tasmanian government is taking a rights-based approach, including the rights of the child and young person, and the rights of the victim and the community, and addressing the consequences of behaviours through restorative and therapeutic youth justice approaches. A working group with representatives from the Department of Health, Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management, Department of Justice and the Department for Education, Children and Young People is meeting regularly to inform the act review policy considerations.

Consultation will commence shortly with key stakeholders including children and young people with lived experience of the justice system, Aboriginal communities, and victims of crime by children and young people. Through this collaborative approach, the views reflected lived experience, service needs and support youth justice system change.

Question E: the review of youth bail laws, with reference to Section 24C of the Youth Justice Act of 1997. The Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government’s Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings made multiple recommendations relating to bail for children and young people, as well as relating to broader youth justice issues, such as raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility and the types of government facilities that should be available for children and young people. There is a large volume of work underway in relation to these other aspects of reform of the youth justice system. 

Question F: legislation providing for Workplace Protection Orders. Workplace Protection Orders represent a new approach introduced in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Tasmanian government is carefully assessing the relevance and suitability of such measures within Tasmania's legal and workplace safety frameworks.

Question G: minimum packaging standards of knives and other sharp objects and the ban on importation of knives and sharp objects by minors. The government is progressing legislation to ban the sale of knives to children and young people. As the legislation is being developed, consideration will be given to including retailer responsibilities such as signage requirements and secure storage of knives in retail businesses. The proposed legislation will be consulted on through the usual public consultation process.

Question H is regarding the case study research into 30 youth offenders with 50 or more police charges in 2024. The Tasmanian government's youth justice system reform policy decisions are directly informed by evidence-based work across several agencies, including data analysis and review of best-practice models. The Youth Justice Blueprint and Youth Justice Model of Care ensures that service delivery is child-and-young-person centred and there is a shared understanding of what a therapeutic approach to youth justice means. 

The Tasmanian government continues to apply an evidence-based approach to better understand the systemic and social factors that influence youth offending and risk-taking behaviours. This work is underway and ongoing, and includes case study analysis of young people with high-level offending behaviour and the circumstances of a cohort of young people who have interacted with custodial youth justice.

The available data and information relating to a specific cohort of young people's education, engagement, Tasmania Police interactions, child safety and youth justice is assisting to build a deeper understanding of offending behaviours to inform policy reform. 

Question I is regarding increased investment in early intervention programs: the Tasmanian government is committed to delivering a youth justice system that achieves better outcomes for children and young people and their families and keeps our community safe. The Tasmanian government has invested $3.7 million over three years into supporting JCPs Youth BEAST program, which aims to support the diversion of at-risk young people from offending behaviours. The Tasmanian government is investing a total of $7.5 million over three years to support innovative local initiatives and partnerships that target the root causes of youth offending in local communities, divert young people out of the youth justice system and provide support to young people on bail. This investment delivers on the commitment to the commission of inquiry recommendation that the Tasmanian government develop a youth justice diversion reservices framework and begin delivering programmes under the framework by 2025, which was recommendation 12.13.

The Youth Justice Blueprint 2024 to 2034 sets the direction for a contemporary youth justice system in Tasmania. The Youth Justice Blueprint has a focus on diversion away from the youth justice system through a range of early intervention supports for families, diversion programs and community-based alternatives to custodial remand. 

As part of the blueprint commitment, the Tasmanian government has released the Youth Justice Model of Care and Implementation Plan. The implementation of the model of care is underway, beginning with the development of a self-assessment tool to support organisations providing youth justice services to assess their current activities against the model of care and make changes as appropriate. The diversionary services framework provides guidance for the procurement of services consistent with the model of care.

A youth after-hours diversion service is being delivered through two contracted organisations: Catholic Care and Anglicare. From the Glenorchy, Bridgewater, Hobart and Bellerive police stations, the aim of the Youth After-Hours Diversion Service (YADS) pilot is to divert young people from the youth justice system through police bail, which can reduce the potential for them to be remanded at Ashley Youth Detention Centre with the aim of diverting young people away from offending behaviours.

The review of 54 Reasons bail support and transition from detention program has been completed, and a response is being prepared to the review's recommendations, including opportunities to expand the services.

Work on the Aboriginal Youth Justice Strategy - the strategy - is occurring in parallel to engagement on the suite of youth justice reforms according to the direction outlined in the Youth Justice Blueprint. The strategy is being developed in partnership with Aboriginal people and organisations, which is underpinned by self-determination and focuses on prevention, early intervention and diversion strategies for Aboriginal children and young people. Have your Say Posters and pamphlets were distributed in April 2025 to the community to provide information and prompt discussion as part of ongoing community engagement about the Aboriginal Youth Justice Strategy.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.4_D=2.4_C=0.71] Question J - A review [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.5_D=23.9_C=0.84] ...

Ms O'CONNOR - Point of order, Mr President. I know this is important information, but I see more pages there in the answer and wondering how much longer this will go. There's two full pages to go, and I wonder if it's possible, on a government business day, for example, it might be tabled if it's a particularly long answer. I'm noting it's an extremely long answer.

Ms RATTRAY -  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=55.6_D=5.4_C=0.77] I did approach the member prior to the sitting and asked the question [Bookmark: Phr5_O=61.3_D=28.7_C=0.82]  and within her rights, she asked that it be read. So that is the process.

Mr PRESIDENT - For members information, we tend to table questions that have graphs or other information in them and it's up to the questioner and the government as to how a question is answered. If members wish to have the [Bookmark: Phr6_O=90.8_D=1.8_C=0.28]  answers read out in full [Bookmark: Phr7_O=93.0_D=30.0_C=0.70] , then that is the prerogative of the member, so continue, please.

Ms RATTRAY - The answer to question (J) - We recognise that some children and young people alternate flexible learning provisions are required to enable access, participation and engagement in education. This includes Tasmanian E-school, support schools, T4 re engagement programs and the recognition of part-time enrolments [Bookmark: Phr8_O=123.1_D=29.5_C=0.80] . All T4 engagement programs have a social worker and school psychology allocation to provide support and intervention as required.

Young people exiting AYDC are supported to return to the school they were previously enrolled at or to seek a suitable supported alternative education pathway, in addition to the supports provided by schools and the Department of Education, Children and Young People. The Office of the Education Registrar [Bookmark: Phr9_O=153.6_D=14.8_C=0.79]  provides an additional layer of support to students and families who face challenges with non-attendance through the compulsory conciliation conference. A conciliation conference is run by an experienced and independent conciliator with the aim is to re-engage the student with their education under the framework of restorative practise.

The conciliator is required to report to the Registrar of Education Education on the outcome of the conciliation. If there has been an agreement reached, the registrar may make a formal requirement that the parties do these things [Bookmark: Phr11_O=196.2_D=3.4_C=0.60]  they agreed to. If there is not an agreement [Bookmark: Phr12_O=200.0_D=30.0_C=0.74]  reached, then the registrar will consider the conciliator's report and make a determination based on the report and what happened in the conciliation and make a formal requirement. If a requirement of a registrar is not complied with, then the registrar may decide to refer the matter to the principal officer, non-attendance for a compulsory school in order a CSO to be made. Failure to comply with the CSO is an offence under the act and it may be referred to the Magistrate's [Bookmark: Phr13_O=230.1_D=10.5_C=0.74]  Court, and a charge may issue. This could result in a criminal record and a fine or community service order.
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=244.9_D=22.8_C=0.84] 

No. 4 - Ashley Youth Detention Centre - Misconduct Matters and the Commission of Inquiry 

Again, before I read this, I would like to indicate that again to the member for Mersey, that is a lengthy question and I seek your guidance on what you would like me to do with this.

Mr Gaffney - I'd like these read out please, because people are listening. They have waited a long time for them, so thank you.

Ms RATTRAY - This is question 4, Mr President.


The answer to question 1on the AYDC matters that have been transferred to the shared capability and centralised investigation, the SCCI unit [Bookmark: Phr15_O=270.8_D=2.8_C=0.75]  within the State Service Management Office of the Department of Premier and Cabinet as of 2 October 2025, there have been no AYDC staff found to be in breach of the State Service Code of Conduct due to child sexual abuse allegations noting that there are investigations that are still ongoing in relation to allegations of child sexual abuse.

One former AYDC staff member has been charged with child sexual abuse offences in AYDC.

Of the matters that have been transferred to the SCCI as of the 2 October 2025:

	(a)	Three have had a determination of no breach for allegations relating to child sexual abuse and cleared to return to work

	(b)	The Department of Education, Children and Young People (DECYP) hold the information on the status of employment for these employees.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=22.5_D=7.9_C=0.81] Question 4. The total direct cost of the commission of inquiry itself expended in accordance with the Commission of Inquiry Act 1995  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.8_D=15.3_C=0.79] was assessed at $27.4 million. 

Question 5. The costs associated with investigating allegations of misconduct by AYDC staff within the Department for  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=46.4_D=29.8_C=0.86] Education, Children and Young People is not readily available due to the nature of how the work is undertaken and recorded. DECYP staff undertake investigations as part of their role and do not track time, salary or costs incurred as part of the process against specific tasks. 

DECYP engages external investigators on occasions but, similar to above, the cost associated with external investigations is not readily available.  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=76.4_D=8.2_C=0.76] To obtain costs of external investigations, a review of each individual misconduct case would be required and the costs counted manually.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=90.8_D=15.6_C=0.86] Question 6. Since the commencement of the Department for Education, Children and Young People in October 2022, the cost of wages and other employment costs for current employees suspended due to allegations arising  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=106.5_D=15.9_C=0.85] during the course of their employment at AYDC is $4,141,961.39. 

A financial year cost breakdown is listed below:

2022-23:  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=122.5_D=15.9_C=0.90] $436,206.32.

2023-24: $1,015,608.61. 

2024-25: $2,000,620.70. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=138.6_D=7.9_C=0.86] 

1 July to 24 September 2025 is $680,525.76.

I trust that it adds up to $4,141,961.39.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=164.1_D=28.7_C=0.84] Question 7. The total amount paid to civil claimants for abuse experienced at or in connection with the AYDC is approximately $110 million. The data does not record what amounts are paid for a particular type of misconduct of abuse. The data also does not record whether a payment was made due to misconduct by staff or by other detainees and does not indicate what proportion of the payment  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=192.9_D=15.6_C=0.76] relates to AYDC in cases where abuse has occurred in AYDC and also other state institutions or institutional context. 

Question 8. The Tasmanian government does not budget costs for claims  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=208.7_D=6.0_C=0.74] of child sexual abuse against particular state institutions, such as AYDC. 

As of 30 June 2025, the Department of Justice Actuaries estimates the outstanding claim liabilities at $579 million, including claims related to AYDC. 
In the 2025-26 State Budget, the Tasmanian government allocated a further $55.4 million for child abuse claims, bringing the current  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=245.3_D=0.6_C=0.95] allocation  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=246.2_D=29.0_C=0.82] total to $296.2 million over 4 years. 

Question 9. Civil litigation and employment investigations are different processes. Whilst both processes could potentially relate to the same incident, it is important to remember that a settlement, the AYDC class action included 129 individual victim/survivors with experiences of abuse from 1960 through to 2023.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=275.6_D=24.2_C=0.84] Tasmanian government accepted liability for the abuse of these children and young people at AYDC over this period, after undertaking extensive investigations to validate their claims. The AYDC claim action, including the settlement, takes into account the evidence, including substantiated and unsubstantiated allegations. 

Question 10. The Department of Premier and Cabinet shared capability and centralised investigations the SCCI unit are not aware of any individuals who have been identified as having made false and/or fraudulent allegations.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=21.2_D=5.9_C=0.68] Question 11. Not applicable, noting response for Question 10 was not yes.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=28.5_D=24.6_C=0.87] Question 12. Not applicable, noting response for Question 10 was not yes. 

Question 13. Civil litigation and employment investigations are different processes. Employment investigations are administrative processes conducted by employing agencies. Civil litigation is a legal process conducted in courts. Both processes operate  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=53.9_D=4.4_C=0.80] for different purposes, with different thresholds, different evidentiary requirements and can occur  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=58.6_D=3.1_C=0.85] at different times.

Question 14.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=63.2_D=29.4_C=0.81] The National Redress Scheme provides support to redress applicants via No More, a nationwide free and confidential service which supports victim/survivors of childhood abuse through the provision of trauma informed legal assistance, financial counselling, social support and specialised cultural support for First Nations people. 

In addition to this national support service, a number of Tasmanian non-government organisations also offer support  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=92.8_D=13.4_C=0.78] to people interacting with the National Redress Scheme, including Relationships Australia, Sexual Assault Support Services and the Blue Knot Foundation and the South East Tasmanian Aboriginal Corporation (SETAC [Bookmark: Phr8_O=107.9_D=14.5_C=0.62] ), Neena Lena [TBC 11.32.35 a.m.] Tasmanian Aboriginal Redress Support Service.

The Department of Justice can assist National Redress Scheme participants who have accepted an offer of redress with a counselling and psychological care  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=123.2_D=29.7_C=0.86] component. However, the department does not have access to the information required to assist an individual victim/survivor until confirmation of their offer acceptance has been received from the scheme. It can take up to six weeks for the scheme to process an acceptance letter and convey this to the relevant jurisdiction. While the process is underway, victim/survivors residing in Tasmania can access free legal and/or financial assistance through independent organisations referenced above.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=153.0_D=29.6_C=0.80] Victim/survivors can also receive support under a mental health care plan prepared by general practitioner. 

Question 15. The Department of Justice notes that Alicia was a witness before the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian government's responses to child sexual abuse in institutional settings (the commission of inquiry), and Alicia's evidence was tested and considered by the commission of inquiry.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=182.9_D=29.7_C=0.79] Question 16. The commission of inquiry heard and examined evidence to support its important work. The commission of inquiry's final report, titled Who Was Looking After Me Prioritising the Safety of Tasmania's Children was delivered to the Governor of Tasmania on 31 August 2023 and tabled in parliament on 26 September 2023. 

The commission of inquiry's final report contains the commission's process, reasoning and  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=212.9_D=3.5_C=0.55] findings.

Question 17.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=217.6_D=12.1_C=0.80] The COI identified a high volume of serious allegations at AYDC involving current and former employees across both historical and recent periods.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=230.5_D=8.9_C=0.83] It is acknowledged that a number of these ED5 matters with historical allegations have been outstanding for a considerable time.  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=239.6_D=2.5_C=0.89] This is because this is difficult work.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=243.1_D=29.5_C=0.82] They are the most serious of allegations and new allegations continue to emerge. 

Every employment-based investigation relating to the AYDC is treated with the seriousness demanded of the subject matter, including the need to bring such investigations and processes to a conclusion whilst ensuring the protection of the children is at the forefront whilst balancing natural justice and due process with transparency.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=273.8_D=29.0_C=0.84] Question 18. The department is unaware of an inconsistent approach to suspending staff. The department takes allegations of breaches of the state service code of conduct (the code) very seriously. The department has robust governance arrangements and detailed processes in place when allegations against current employees are received. All employees who are subject to allegations of child sexual abuse arising from duty.

The process that is followed with all allegations involves the following:

Allegations are referred to the secretary to consider whether they are reasonable grounds to believe that a breach of the code may have occurred and whether suspension under Employment Direction No. 4 is in the public interest.

The secretary has discretion under ED5 whether to investigate all alleged breaches and whether or not to appoint an investigator. Such decisions are influenced by the seriousness of the alleged conduct and what evidence is available at the time of that decision.

If an investigation is commenced and an investigator appointed, the secretary is provided with an investigation report prepared by an independent investigator. Following the consideration of the report and the employees response to the report, the secretary makes a determination with regard to a breach of the Code and whether the alleged conduct may also comprise reportable conduct under the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Act 2023.

If a determination of a breach of the code is made, a range of sanctions may be imposed in accordance with the State Service Act 2000. If a finding of reportable conduct is made, that is reported to the office of the independent regulator for its consideration.

If a code process results in a decision that an employee has breached the code of conduct, the available sanctions include:

counselling,
a reprimand,
deductions from salary by way of fine,
reductions in salary,
reassignment of duties,
reduction in classification and
termination of employment.

Only the secretary may impose the sanction of termination of employment subject to consultation with the State Service Management Office.

A detailed determination is provided to the respondent employee, including the reasons for any finding that the employee has breached the code. A letter of outcome explaining the process and thanking key witnesses for their participation is provided once the outcome is communicated to the employee.

Confidentiality is an important element of all code matters and all responsible efforts are made to otherwise keep the details of any investigation confidential, both to maintain the integrity of the process and so the privacy of these involved is maintained.

(19)	A key feature of the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People scheme is the ongoing monitoring of registered persons.

When the registrar receives new and relevant information relating to a registered person, the registrar will conduct an additional risk assessment on the person's suitability to continue to hold registration.

As part of the risk assessment, the registrar may continue to receive and/or request further information from agencies relating to that person. The registrar uses this information collectively to assess the level of risk a person presents to vulnerable people.

Under the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Act 2013, the registrar has grounds to suspend a person's registration while they are under an additional risk assessment. 

The registrar will suspend a person's registration when having considered the available information if they form the belief that the registered person likely presents an unacceptable risk of harm to vulnerable people. The purpose of suspending a person's registration is to remove that person from regulated activities and mitigate any risks to vulnerable people while the risk assessment process is completed.

The decision to suspend is made on the specific information, both contemporary and historical, relating to that registered person and resulting identified risks. Given the unique nature of each risk assessment, comparison should not be made between individual matters and their respective outcomes.

(20)	Suspension of staff under Employment Direction No. 4 is a lawful and necessary measure used when it is in the public interest to temporarily remove an employee from the workplace.

Such action may be taken, for example, to protect the integrity of investigations, ensure the safety and wellbeing of children and staff, and uphold public confidence in the state service.

In such circumstances, suspended employees are restricted from workplace contact to prevent interference with witnesses, evidence or ongoing inquiries.

Employment Direction No. 5 outlines procedures for investigating alleged breaches of the code of conduct, including trauma-informed and child-safety-focused practises. These may involve limiting contact between suspended staff and colleagues to protect vulnerable individuals and maintai [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.3_D=15.2_C=0.80] n procedural fairness. Importantly, suspended employees retain access to support services, including the Employee Assistance Program, and are kept informed through the appropriate channels.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=98.8_D=29.5_C=0.83] Answer to Question 22. The government acknowledges that investigations and suspensions can be deeply challenging for individuals, particularly in high-pressure environments like youth justice. Allegations involving child safety must be treated seriously and processes are guided by employment directions and the principles of procedural fairness. While the government does not comment on individual cases, it recognises the importance of supporting staff [Bookmark: Phr8_O=128.8_D=24.4_C=0.82]  who are cleared of wrongdoing. Options such as restorative processes and access to support services may be considered where appropriate. 

Answer to Question 23. The Department for Education, Children and Young People, in addition to the general supports referred to in response to Question 21, in April 2025 engaged [Bookmark: Phr9_O=154.5_D=5.9_C=0.79]  a contracted service provider to deliver a pilot program of support for suspended employees [Bookmark: Phr10_O=160.9_D=29.7_C=0.73] , including wellbeing checks, personal counselling and engagement strategies and advice for managers in how to support their staff who are suspended. All suspended employees were individually contacted in May 2025 with advice about how to access support from the pilot program. Employees have also recently received information about the department's new employee wellbeing connect services which [Bookmark: Phr11_O=190.8_D=29.9_C=0.81]  further improve on the previous support offerings. 

Answer to Question 24. The Tasmanian government addresses vexatious or false allegations through procedural safeguards embedded in the State Service Act 2000, employment directions and the integrity commission's misconduct framework. Investigations must uphold procedural fairness, including preliminary assessments to test credibility and intent.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=221.2_D=19.9_C=0.82] While Tasmania does not have stand-alone legislation targeting vexatious complaints against public servants, current frameworks allow agencies to manage such conduct appropriately, ensuring both accountability and protection from misuse of complaint processes.

No. 9 - Investment in Sport in Tasmania

[11.47 a.m.]
The following answer to a question on notice was given.

Ms THOMAS question to MINISTER for SPORT, Mr DUIGAN

Can the Government provide a breakdown of its investment in sport in Tasmania in the last ten years, detailing calculations and total funding invested in the following:

professional sport - including team and individual athlete sponsorship, events and funding for any other operational purpose.

elite sport - including athlete development, team and individual athlete sponsorship, and funding for any other operational purpose;

community sport – including sport development programs and funding for any other operational purpose;

facilities for professional sport;

facilities for elite sport;

facilities for community in each region of Tasmania (South, North, North-West); and

Will the Government commit to developing a community sport infrastructure and investment program for each region of Tasmania (south, north, north-west) by the end of 2026?

ANSWER

Tasmanian government investment into sport in Tasmania occurs through various areas of the Department of State Growth including Active Tasmania, Infrastructure Tasmania, Events Tasmania and the Tasmanian Institute of Sport. To provide accurate data across all sport related investment, the department has included committed investments from 2021 to 2026, unless otherwise specified. Data prior to 2020-21 is not available to be accurately collated and presented in the time frame. Some of the following figures reflect committed investments, and in some cases, instalments may be paid in 2026-27 and beyond.

In sponsorship, events, development, operational A, B and C, a total investment of $328.3 million in the area of sponsorship events, development and operational purposes across professional, elite and community sporting applications. Given the various investment sources into sponsorship, events, development, and other operational purpose, the data is presented by relevant business area and then further broken down into categories to reflect the intent of the question.

Active Tasmania. Since 2020-21, a total of $38.5 million has been invested for sport development programmes and other operational programmes split as following; professional $6.4 million, community $32.1 million. The above figures include current agreements with instalments due in 2025-26 or later. Agreements not yet finalised or that remain under negotiation are not included above, however funding is included in the 2025-26 State Budget.

Events Tasmania. Since 2021, a total of $118.3 million has been invested into sporting events across the following categories Special partnerships, elite and professional. This includes items such as Hawthorn Football Club, JackJumpers, T20 World Cup. $90.2 million, major events elite/community - this includes items such as Point to Pinnacle, Dancesport championships, Emergency Service Games - $20 million [Bookmark: Phr2_O=17.1_D=10.7_C=0.84] , all other events community and this includes items such as Cadbury Marathon, Tasmanian Pickleball Championship - $8.1  million.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.1_D=27.9_C=0.75] The area of strategy, housing, infrastructure and planning, professional sport, the club funding and development agreement signed with the AFL, a total of $164 million has been committed to the Tasmanian Devils Football Club for elite sport. That is made-up of establishment funding of $20 million and operational funding of $144 million. The Tasmanian Institute of Sport elite sport from 2019-20 to 2024-25 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=58.4_D=29.7_C=0.80] , total of $7.3 million has been invested in TIS sports programs each year, excluding salaries and overheads. This funding supports the training environment and direct athlete needs, including medical, competition and other high-performance requirements.

Facilities are D, E and F. In relation to facilities, the difference between professional and elite sporting facilities is not easily identifiable. Further, there are very limited [Bookmark: Phr5_O=88.2_D=23.8_C=0.73]  facilities in the state that are dedicated to professional or elite sporting facilities. As such the following categories have been adopted - elite/professionals such as the AFL High Performance Centre, professional/community - UTAS Stadium, Silverdome, My State Bank Arena, JackJumpers High Performance Centre; community - Devonport Oval, Glenorchy Pool and Elphin Sports Centre.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=113.1_D=29.8_C=0.71] Silverdome - the venue is regularly used each week for community use, supported by some elite sporting and cultural events throughout the year. During 2025, netball training occurred at the Silverdome four nights per week year-round. The Launceston Cycling Club used the velodrome for training and track meets. The Tasmanian Institute of Sport utilise the facility for training and meets. Commercial and elite use in 2025 included two home JackJumpers' matches, two professional indoor rodeos, several [Bookmark: Phr7_O=143.0_D=30.0_C=0.77]  school leavers dinners, makers markets and hosting Targa Tasmania.

UTAS Stadium - the stadium is regularly used each week for community and local use, playing host to the North Launceston Bombers in the NTFA which includes training twice per week for their senior program and twice per week for the junior program and home matches for the North Launceston Footy Club. Throughout the winter Utah Stadium hosts the National Tasmania Football Association finals series including grand final weekend and the AFL Tasmania Junior [Bookmark: Phr8_O=173.2_D=3.8_C=0.70]  Pathway program trains from that venue. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=178.6_D=25.2_C=0.70]  Over summer, it hosts the Greater Northern Raiders cricket and the Under 17 National Cricket Carnival. In 2025, UTAS Stadium was used for elite sport on six occasions. one AFL pre-season match for AFL home and away season matches, one AFLW match.

Since 2021, a total of $534.6 million [Bookmark: Phr10_O=204.3_D=27.6_C=0.81]  has been invested into state sporting facilities, including additional funding for key projects included in the 2025-26 state budgets. Investment across the categories as follow - elite/professional $115 million, professional/community $224.3 million, community $195.4 million. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=232.7_D=2.5_C=0.78] 

In relation to the investment into community facilities, the [Bookmark: Phr12_O=235.6_D=29.6_C=0.78]  total of $195.4 million has been allocated across the regions as follows - south $66.3 million (34 per cent), north $69 million (35 per cent), northwest $60.1 million (31 per cent). Further, the 2025-26 state budget included funding for the Kingsborough Sports Precinct and the Tasmanian Active Infrastructure Grant program [Bookmark: Phr13_O=265.5_D=27.7_C=0.84]  and Active Tasmania will also provide a minor facilities' program this financial year. This is an additional $30.6 million which is not included in the totals outlined above.

Community sporting infrastructure projects are continuing to be delivered in partnership with the Commonwealth and local governments. The Department of State Growth published the Tasmanian Community Support Facilities portal on five September 2025 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=293.3_D=3.8_C=0.82]  capturing and displaying, as an initial phase, council owned facilities and [Bookmark: Phr15_O=297.4_D=7.6_C=0.78]  school facilities data. More facility datasets can be expanded in the portal over coming time, and this work will be considered as part of an evaluation of the first stage of this initiative. The portal provides the functionality to overlay and draw insights from a range of datasets. In this initial phase, the system can report on community sport facilities by local government area, population, census data, facility type and key information on the latest major facility upgrades where this has been provided. The portal is a key input to guide future investment of community sport infrastructure. A potential next step is to consider, in early 2026, the development of a strategic plan to provide the Tasmanian government and stakeholders with a framework to inform future investment decisions.

SPECIAL INTEREST MATTERS

Free2b Girls

[12.01 p.m.]
Ms PALMER (Rosevears - Minister for Children and Youth) - Mr President, I rise today to share a story of an inspiring initiative making a real difference in the lives of young women in my electorate of Rosevears. At the heart of the Beaconsfield Neighbourhood House is a really vibrant program called Free2b Girls. It's a space where young women come together to learn and to grow and to simply be themselves.

This program is led by Dannielle Murfet[checked], an amazing local mum of four who has more energy than you could believe. I first met Dannielle over five years ago when she was not only running a small business, Totally Mum Made, but was also lobbying for support to upgrade the Beaconsfield Primary School swimming pool. As if her life wasn't busy enough, she grabbed an opportunity to coordinate Free2b Girls, run through the Beaconsfield Neighbourhood House.

With around 15 girls involved. Free2b Girls offers a safe and supportive environment where these young women, or maybe we should say tweens, build confidence, develop skills, and form lasting friendships. With a focus on girls in rural regions across Tasmania, we see a number of groups running in communities such as St Helens, Longford and Campbell Town, and attention is given to wellbeing and nurturing, with some potential for lots of fun. As one participant put it, 'It's a good place to just be silly.' It sometimes feels like just being silly can be quite risky for young people, with the intrusion of mobile devices that have the potential to beam your life to the world. That simple phrase, 'It's a good place to just be silly,' captures the joy, the freedom and the acceptance that this program brings.

These amazing and unique West Tamar young women are learning practical skills like financial literacy. They also do some sewing and some cooking. They also had a skateboard session, where they were determined to get me on a skateboard doing laps of the Beaconsfield Community Centre, and they succeeded. I believe my attempts were a great source of amusement to them all. They're also exploring entrepreneurship by creating handmade items - hair accessories, pens and key chains - which they then go on to sell at our local markets in Beauty Point and Exeter, with the money raised to support their group.

Beyond activities, the program fosters intergenerational mentorship. It connects these girls with older women in our community who share their wisdom and encouragement. Another participant said, 'Free2b Girls has so much stuff to do and it's all age appropriate, and the volunteers are just so nice.' What I personally love about this group is how they actively give back to our community. They've made craft packs for local children, catered the ANZAC Day lunch for 90 people, and hosted a community dinner for International Women's Day, celebrating local women leaders and showing them what young women can achieve when empowered.

Their next project involves making and selling boomerang bags, promoting sustainability and demonstrating how small actions can make a big impact. The program also supports mental health through mindfulness activities like colouring sessions, giving the girls space to pause and reflect. When you have these young women saying they love Free2b Girls because, 'It makes me feel happy and more loved,' you know it's just what they need to keep their lives thriving and keep them thriving in our community.

I want to commend Dannielle Murfet for her leadership; Jane Pinnington, the centre manager of the Beaconsfield Neighbourhood House; and all the volunteers who are involved in Free2b Girls for their dedication and their vision. We know that programs like this, that connect young women not only to each other, but also to older women in their community, can create a safer environment for them. It's so important we have a nurturing, connected and confident community for future generations. It's wonderful to see these capable and compassionate young people, who feel they can be really safe just being silly like all other kids.


Scottsdale Cattle Handler - Will Hadley

[12.05 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, thank you. Most of the people in here will probably know the agricultural show season has just concluded across the state; the 115th Circular Head Show was the final show on the calendar. Those shows have cattle-handling as a major feature of many of those shows, particularly in the north of the state.

Today, I'd like to share with honourable members the journey of one young cattle handler who is representing our state and our country on the world stage. Will Hadley[checked], 21 years of age, a young Scottsdale local who is a part of the Team Australia who were named the overall champions of the inaugural B.E.E.F. International Competition at Farm Fair, held in Edmonton, Canada, early November this year. B.E.E.F. stands for Battle of Emerging Elite Farmer - what a title.

The competition ran for five days, which included a range of workshops including judging classes, herdsmen competitions, and fitting workshops, with Australia reigning supreme over the biggest beef breeding countries in the world. For each, judging took place where competitors were evaluated across the duration, and Team Australia ultimately came out on top.

Will's cattle-handling career started at the Scottsdale High School in year 7. I'm sorry that the Minister for Education has left the Chamber, because this is why the Scottsdale High School needs a new facility at the school farm, because look what we are achieving. There are many young people that have come through the school cattle-handling program and continue to grow as young people because of that program.

Will has gone on to establish his own stud beef herd, the Heatherfield Angus, with many successes along the way at the agricultural shows in Tasmania. I go to most of them across my electorate, and Will and his family are there supporting each other, showing their cattle, and if he's not showing his own, his cattle-handling for the Scottsdale High School, or some of the other farming pursuits that they're showing. He's had wins at the Royal Queensland and the Royal Sydney Shows, and that certainly cemented Will's place in the Australian team.

His time in Canada included training and some touring of ranches and purebred operations prior to the competition. The competition concluded on the Sunday evening, and Will was straight on a flight home, landing in Launceston on the Tuesday, in preparation for his hometown show at Scottsdale that weekend. That's how dedicated this young cattle-handler is, not only to what his chosen sport or his interest is, but also to his direct community.

Will described the experience as 'surreal' and something he would cherish forever, and he has potential future plans of spending more time in Canada and introducing Canadian genetics into his own operation of his Heatherfield Angus Stud.

I want to sincerely congratulate Will and the other members of the Australian team on winning B.E.E.F. for Australia. I think it's a wonderful achievement, and again, it just shows what dedication, effort and hard work can be achieved, has been achieved and will continue to be achieved by young Will Hadley.

MOTIONS

Alcohol and Drugs Members' Statement

[12.14 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, I move the following motion -

With reference to the Interim Report of the Joint Sessional Committee on Workplace Culture Oversight (Paper No. 26), that for the current Parliament, unless otherwise ordered, the Council agree to the following statement for Members in relation to alcohol and other drugs - 

Our acknowledgements 

Attendance at social and community events, official functions, protocol, and other activities where alcohol is served are frequent features of the work of an elected Member of Parliament. We value the reputation of the institution of Parliament, public trust in Members, and the safety and welfare of the people with whom we work. 

We acknowledge that impairment from alcohol or other drugs can significantly increase risks to Work Health and Safety, including during work related travel. 

We acknowledge that alcohol use is correlated with sexual harassment and assault.  

We accept that our role as elected Members of Parliament does not excuse irresponsible consumption of alcohol or being more generally impaired by alcohol and other drugs. 

Our commitments 

We commit to managing the risks associated with alcohol and other drug use and acknowledge our shared responsibility under the Work Health and Safety Act to maintain a safe and respectful workplace for all. 

We commit to principles of responsible consumption of alcohol and preventing the adverse consequences of impairment from alcohol and drug use on staff and other Members in the workplace. 

We respect the choice of an individual to not consume alcohol in any setting where alcohol is served. 

We recognise and respond to inappropriate behaviour, intervening when needed, and encourage and support others to speak up.  [OK]

Mr President, it's taken a while to get here today, but I'm very pleased to be able to move these motions on behalf of this House and the parliament and I know we followed up on it in the other place by the Premier. In doing that, I acknowledge and pay respect to the work of our project team and welcome them to the Chamber. Notably, Andrew Young is the consultant who's been working with the Workplace Culture Oversight committee to deliver these really important parts of the recommendations made. Also Caitlin and Anne, who are no longer with us, but they've done a whole body of work that supports that. They are back in their substantive roles now, but we thank them for being here and acknowledge that enormous amount of work that they have put into this. It's really important that we acknowledge that, Mr President.

I will speak broadly to all three motions before the House. I think it's more effective to do it that way. They are linked in many ways, and I will move the first motion as has been read at the end. 

These three motions are the result of three years of work by the Joint Parliamentary Sessional Committee on Workplace Culture Oversight. The committee first met in September 2022 to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of what is informally known as the Bolt report, that is the report titled Motion for Respect - Report into Workplace Culture in the Tasmanian Ministerial and Parliamentary Services, an independent review of this workplace conducted by the former Anti-Discrimination Commissioner, Sarah Bolt.

I acknowledge the leadership of the Premier and the initial establishment and initial work of the committee. It is important to see the Bolt report in the broader context of the developments in standards in Westminster Parliaments in Australia and overseas. In the four years preceding the Bolt review, similar reviews were conducted in the United Kingdom Parliament, New Zealand, New South Wales, South Australia and perhaps most notably, in the Australian Parliament following the allegations made by Brittany Higgins.

In all cases, codes of conduct have been modernised or established for the first time and, in most cases, independent complaints processes have been set up.

In 2024, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association published new standards for codes of conduct throughout the Commonwealth. It is broadly accepted that members are part of the workplace, even if their status as employees or employers is unclear.

Members and staff in parliamentary ministerial workplaces have a right to be safe in the workplace. Complaints processes need to be more professional and independent. It is accepted that resources need to be provided to the parliament's Clerks to ensure that training and support for new procedures, including independent complaints processes, are effective.

While this broader context is important, it is worth repeating some key aspects of the Bolt report. The review had a comparatively high survey response rate of 56.5 per cent, including 318 members and staff, an indication that members and staff were highly motivated to speak up. It identified a range of workplace behaviours, in particular bullying, harassment and discrimination. It found that the House's code of conduct was no longer fit for purpose. There were unclear or no avenues for people to make or take complaints. It emphasised the rights of everyone, including members of parliament, to a safe and fair workplace.

The code and the Independent Complaints Commissioner motions have to be read in conjunction to fully understand the scope of what is being proposed. Section 2.1 of the code makes it clear that a complaint may be made against a member, including a minister or presiding officer acting in their capacity as a member.

With regard to former members, section 2.1 of the code also provides that a former member may be held to account for a breach of the code, but only if the alleged breach of the code occurred when they were a member.

With regard to ministers, section 1.1.1 of the Independent Complaints Commissioner motion provides that the commissioner can receive a complaint of alleged behaviour of a minister that breaches section 6 of the code in relation to a safe and respectful workplace. The reason for this specific inclusion is because it would be difficult and counterproductive to decide if a minister accused of bullying or sexually harassing a person had done so in their capacity as a minister or a member. For the avoidance of doubt, the commissioner has no jurisdiction to investigate a complaint that a minister has otherwise breached the Ministerial Code of Conduct. Such matters remain a matter for the Premier and the ministerial code that the Premier oversees.

With regard to people eligible to make a complaint, section 1.7 of the Independent Complaints Commissioner motion provides a description of the people who may make a complaint that a member has breached the code. These people include members of parliament and those employed pursuant to an act of Tasmania or by Crown prerogative, whose duties require them to engage with members of parliament. The prescription means that not only are staff with everyday contact with members such as parliamentary staff, ministerial advisers included, but so is a public servant whose duties may include briefing a member or minister but does not have necessarily have frequent contact with them.

Section 1.8 of the Independent Complaints Commissioner motion provides that a complaint cannot be made if the alleged conduct occurred prior to the resolution of the code of conduct. It further provides that complaints must be logged within two years of the alleged conduct occurring. This timeframe seeks to strike the right balance in acknowledging that a victim of certain behaviour, or a person who knows of improper conduct by a member, may have legitimate reasons for not coming forward immediately. This timeframe is also relevant to the earlier point that if members have since become a former member, the complaint may still be received and acted upon.

Turning to some specific provisions of the code. The Houses have had a code of conduct since 2018. The committee's report has recommended that the Houses resolve an entirely new code that addresses the findings of the Bolt report and reflects the rapidly developing best practice standards for codes of conduct in parliaments, particularly parliaments in the Commonwealth.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.8_D=29.8_C=0.85] The recommended code of conduct for members is in three parts. Part 1 sets out the principles and scope of the code. It is a preamble to the enforceable standards and includes a range of positive statements which are important in setting a tone that is aspirational and consistent with members being leaders in the community. 

Part 2 of the code is the enforceable standards. That is, only alleged breach of the standard in Part 2 can be the basis for a complaint to the Independent Complaints Commissioner. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=57.4_D=18.8_C=0.81]  Section 3 of Part 2 requires an amendment that each member will publicly affirm in their respective House their commitment to the enforceable standards in the code within the first two sitting weeks of being elected. The code leaves it up to the two Houses to decide the form and mechanism of this affirmation. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=76.7_D=17.5_C=0.81]  It should be noted that in the ACT Legislative Assembly, this is done by way of a motion that all members affirm. In some other parliaments, such as Ontario in Canada, it is done by form of a written pledge. The public affirmation by every member is the best way for members to show leadership to the community.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=95.8_D=29.5_C=0.79] Sections 4 and 5 of the code deal with general conduct in public office, including rules regarding engagement of staff, conflicts of interest, lobbying, the use of public resources, financial inducements and complying with the Parliamentary Disclosure of Interest Act 1996. The code does not seek to override or replace rules that are in place, such as the rules for members' use of allowances and resources but requires the members to comply [Bookmark: Phr6_O=125.4_D=1.4_C=0.62]  with those rules.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=128.3_D=21.6_C=0.82] The code's requirements that members comply with all the relevant rules, laws and policies regarding the use of public resources found in section 4, therefore requires members to be aware of their entitlements and responsibilities in the Parliamentary Salaries, Superannuation and Allowances Act 2012 combined with the guides produced by Department of Premier and Cabinet and the Legislative Council.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=151.4_D=29.4_C=0.79] Section 6 of the code is an important initiative because it lists prohibited workplace behaviours, particularly discrimination, bullying, harassment, sexual harassment and sexual assault and victimisation. The code does not define these behaviours in a unique manner but clearly states that they are to be understood consistently with the relevant laws. This is a key aspect of responding to the Bolt report and acknowledging that members and staff are participants in the contemporary workplace [Bookmark: Phr9_O=181.2_D=9.2_C=0.74]  and that, notwithstanding the cut and thrust of politics, people - members included - have a right to a safe and respectful workplace.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=191.9_D=25.2_C=0.82] Section 6 also addresses one of Bolt's key findings about lack of bystander action. Bolt's survey found that only 11 per cent of those who witnessed a prohibited behaviour, such as sexual harassment or bullying, actually intervened. Intervention is not an easy step to take, and the code does not put an unreasonable onus on members. Section 6.2 states that:

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=217.9_D=3.4_C=0.86] Members shall take appropriate steps to protect the health and safety of their staff [Bookmark: Phr12_O=221.9_D=28.4_C=0.80]  and if they observe or receive a report of unacceptable workplace behaviour toward them. [OK]

This code should be read in conjunction with section 1.5 in the principles of the code, which states:

Members ensure that bullying, harassment, sexual harassment or assault, discrimination or victimisation in any form is not tolerated, condoned or ignored in the parliamentary workplace. Members encourage the reporting of such behaviour and the importance of considering the welfare of those affected. [OK]

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=251.9_D=29.2_C=0.82] With regard to online behaviour, the prevalence of the use of digital communications and social media means that they have become an extension of the workplace. This is true of many industries where the behaviour of staff online is treated just as seriously as face-to-face behaviour. Section 7 of the code includes the standard that:

Members shall not use social media, messaging services, email or any other online activity in breach of the Commitment to a safe and respectful workplace [Bookmark: Phr14_O=281.6_D=6.6_C=0.82]  section of the code. [OK]

This stand extends to members being accountable for the use of social media by their staff [Bookmark: Phr15_O=289.1_D=8.8_C=0.85]  and, when the member has authorised the staff to act on the member's behalf, a member will not be held accountable if the staff member acts without authorisation.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=298.7_D=6.3_C=0.91] Section 7 does not prevent robust debate or opinion being expressed on social media or other digital means, but it does make clear that the use of social media media is not a vehicle for directing behaviour at another member or a person who works with members. That is a breach of a safe and respectful workplace behaviour.

Section 9 of the code provides that all members will participate in induction training in relation to the code within certain timeframes after the adoption of the code and after election to a House. The code does not propose that there will be routine public reporting of attendance, but it may be relevant for a complaint's commissioner investigating allegation against a member to know that if a member attended mandatory training. For this purpose, the code requires the Clerks to maintain a record of attendance.

A natural concern for members in a political environment is that the code and complaints process could be weaponised by making groundless complaints against a member. Section 10 of the enforceable standards requires that a member shall not make a complaint alleging a breach of this code by another member unless they have reasonable grounds to suspect noncompliance, or if such a complaint is frivolous or vexatious. Part 3 of the code provides necessary aspects of governance to ensure that the new system of a code, an independent complaints commissioner will work.

Section 12 provides that induction and training will be provided to members and that the member should ensure that their staff are aware of both the member's obligations and the rights and responsibilities of staff in the workplace. Induction and periodic training are crucial elements to professionalising the role of a member and promoting a positive culture.

Section 13 states an independent complaints process will be established, which is the subject of the third motion, in the order we're doing them. Both sections 12 and 13 make reference to the need for Clerks to be properly resourced and to ensure that training can be provided and that the independent complaints process can be established and continue to operate. The model the committee has put forward to the House is not a large cost model; it's not a bureaucratically over-engineered model. However, it will require that the Clerks be supported with resources to ensure the process succeeds. This is something that was fully considered by the committee and the Premier absolutely gets this and has committed to advocating on behalf of this process.

The other motion relating to the independent complaints commissioner provides for the establishment of an independent complaints commissioner. Until recent years, most parliaments in Westminster jurisdictions relied solely on privileges or standards committees of the House to investigate alleged misconduct by a member. In many cases, Houses and committees construe the role of such committees in very narrow terms, so there was no avenue for complaints to be made about the conduct of a member. Furthermore, privileges committees were not equipped to carry out investigations on the basis of procedural fairness or processes that have regard to the welfare of complainants and members. 

The establishment of the independent complaints commissioner addresses these shortcomings and puts in place an independent complaints mechanism already in place in numerous Australian parliaments, including New South Wales, Victoria, the ACT, the Commonwealth, Canada and the UK.

Section 1 of the motion sets out the functions of the ICC, which includes a resolution of minor complaints and imposition of agreed remedies by the ICC itself. A further function is to carry out more formal investigations of more serious breaches of the code or matters which failed to be conciliated. A function of the ICC will be the provision of information and education on the role of the ICC. It is expected that information education will be provided to both members and staff.

Section 1.1.2 makes it clear that complaints involving proceedings of the Houses or committees, that is those things subject to parliamentary privilege, are not within the scope of the ICC. Similarly, the ICC will not investigate matters in the Criminal Code, or which would constitute serious misconduct in the Integrity Commission Act 2009.

There may, therefore, be a small number of things that could constitute a breach of the code of conduct for members, which the ICC would not investigate because they are more properly a matter for the police or the Integrity Commission. It is expected that people appointed as ICC and Deputy ICC will have the experience and expertise to understand the distinction.

Speaking about the appointment of the ICC and Deputy ICC, section 1.2 requires the Speaker and President, acting jointly, to be joined by a suitably qualified person on a panel to select an ICC and Deputy ICC.  The motion does not include a job description or required qualifications, but the various aspects of the code of the ICC motion inform a recruitment process that would logically appoint a person who understands concepts including procedural fairness, victim welfare and evidence-based finding amongst other things.

This section also requires that there be a gender balance between the ICC and Deputy. This is important given the type and sensitive complaints that could be made, being mindful that victim welfare and preparedness to come forward are sometimes based on whether the person can confide in a man or a woman.

Section 1.4 provides that the appointment panel will consult the Premier, Leader of the Opposition, leaders of other parties, crossbench and the independents prior to appoint the appointment of the ICC and Deputy.
Section 1.5 leaves it to the Presiding Officers to contact the ICC and Deputy on terms and conditions. This will enable Presiding Officers, assisted by the Clerks, to consider a retainer approach for the first instance rather than a full-time engagement.

It is not the intention of this motion to create a bureaucracy and over-engineer the establishment of the ICC. There should be no requirement for staff or separate office accommodation for the ICC in its first iteration. If over time, caseloads increase, and one would hope they wouldn't, there would be opportunities for contract arrangements and the terms of the resolutions to be revisited.

Section 3.3 provides that the ICC may seek advice in relation to the nature of a complaint and jurisdictional issues. This may include the right to seek advice from the Clerks on matters of parliamentary procedure and privilege.

Section 3.5 states that, where possible, the ICC will facilitate early confidential resolution or consideration of a complaint without progressing to a formal process. This is important guidance for the ICC, that some matters are best resolved by bringing the complainant and the member together, or having the ICC conciliate individually with each person in the manner that protects both persons privacy, while also finding a resolution agreeable to both.

Dispute resolution, at this early stage, may include remedies such as a verbal or written apology, correction of the public record, agreement to undertake a training or education session, or other remedies dependent on the act or admission that constitutes the breach of the code.

Section 3.6 requires confidentiality in certain circumstances but also enables the ICC to publicly confirm the fact that a complaint has been received; only in exceptional circumstances where this declaration addresses initial fairness for one or the other person. There may be an exceptional case where public conjecture about a matter means it is fairer to one party or the other that the ICC clarify the fact that a complaint has been made.

Section 4 sets out the processes for investigation of more serious allegations and matters that could not be conciliated.

Section 4.4 provides that the ICC may require a person to attend a meeting and to produce documents. The ICC may report a failure to cooperate to the relevant privileges committee.

Section 4.3 requires the ICC to report findings and recommended sanctions to the relevant privileges committee where the recommended section would require consideration and enforcement by the relevant House. An example is when the ICC recommends that a member make a public apology in the House, or the House resolve to admonish the member.

Section 4.7 enables the privileges committee to receive reports from the ICC and to review only the recommended sanction, not to carry out its own investigation of the allegation. The committee will invite the member who has been found to have breached the code to make a submission only in relation to the recommended sanction. The privileges committee will have to include the ICCs report or a summary of it as part of the report to the House, which provides transparency in relation to the matter in general and in relation to the committee's final recommendation for sanction.

It should be noted that when the Houses have adopted the new code and complaints process, the DPAC handbook and other guides should amend any references to a complaint being made to the Integrity Commission and state that alleged breaches of the members' code of conduct can be directed to the Independent Complaints Commissioner.

To speak specifically to the alcohol and other drugs statement, this motion is a statement rather than a policy to acknowledgements and commitments in relation to alcohol and other drugs. It does not seek to prevent or enforce certain behaviours. Enforceable conduct is a matter dealt with in part 2 of the code of conduct. The statement acknowledges, amongst other things in paragraph three, that members acknowledge the impairment from alcohol and other drugs can significantly increase risk to workplace health and safety, including during work-related travel.

Among the commitment made by members in the statement, members commit to managing the risk associated with alcohol and other drug use and acknowledge that our shared responsibility under Work Health and Safety Act to maintain a safe and respectful workplace for all. While these may appear to be self-evident statements, members in parliament in Australia have not made them as a collective before. We are the first jurisdiction to do this. This not only demonstrates community leadership, it also honours the findings of reviews in several parliamentary workplaces, including Tasmania, that irresponsible consumption of alcohol is often associated with incredibly harmful behaviours such as sexual harassment and assault.

To conclude, I wish to make some observations about the relevance of these matters and some very recent public reporting of issues around parliaments in Australia. In just a few days since the workplace culture committee report was tabled in the House, there have been very public reports of alleged conduct in various parliaments around Australia, all of which support the need for a modern code of conduct and an independent, empowered complaints and investigations process.

In Victoria, during debate on a bill in one of the most recent sitting weeks, a member reflected on being a victim of inappropriate workplace behaviour, including sexual harassment, during her time as both an adviser and an elected member. That member was Georgie Purcell[checked], MLC and the reference is Hansard, Legislative Council, 20 November 2025. These comments attracted media coverage and reflected poorly on the Victorian parliament. In South Australia, media has reported that an independent review of workplace culture in the parliament has found that staff believe politics is prioritised over their welfare and that staff are held to a higher standard than members.

The reference for that is ABC South Australia website, 22 November 2025 by reporter Thomas Kelsall[checked]. This followed a report three years earlier by the Equal Opportunity Commissioner which reported allegations of sexual harassment, indecent exposure and physical assault. A new code was put in place in South Australia, but the most recent report suggests that a code must be accompanied by an independent complaints process, training of members and staff and longer-term cultural change.

Only days earlier, the Federal Court of Appeal was considering an appeal from Senator Hanson[checked], who was found by the Federal Court to have racially discriminated against Senator Faruqi[checked] in a 2022 exchange of tweets. Faruqi versus Hanson, 2004 Federal Court of Australia 1264. This case has cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and has brought to light the way in which social media is often used to convey words that would be a breach of workplace behaviour if spoken face to face.

Words said in a digital form can still be intimidating, harassing, bullying or discriminatory. The decision by Justice Stewart in the 2024 case in favour of Senator Faruqi also highlighted the fact that there are limits to the implied right of freedom of political communication when a member of parliament is saying things on social media that were designed to be personally hurtful. If the Commonwealth parliament had a code of conduct that included online behaviour by members and an independent complaints commissioner that could have conciliated or made findings, Senator Faruqi and Senator Hanson could have had an alternative and a much less costly avenue to resolve the complaint.

This code of conduct proposed by our Tasmanian parliament addresses this issue in a balanced manner. It does not seek to prevent social media being used to conduct robust political debate and opinions, but it does make it clear that the use of social media will not be a vehicle for directing behaviour at another member that is a breach of a safe and respectful workplace.

Mr President, I commend the motions to the House and in this instance, I move-

That the members' Alcohol and Other Drugs Statement be agreed to.

[12.40 p.m.]
Ms LOVELL (Rumney) - Mr President, thank you. I want to put a few comments on record as both a member of the committee that's been overseeing much of this work, but also as an elected member in this place and someone who will obviously be impacted by these three motions.

I want to join with the member for Murchison in acknowledging the work that's been done so far, and I acknowledge the member for Murchison as chair of the committee. This work has been ongoing for a long time, we've had a few different iterations of the committee. There have been pauses, there have been interruptions, but we've kept going. I want to acknowledge the member for Murchison for her work as Chair. I know in this place that the member for Murchison is very well respected as an experienced Chair, and she has steered us through this work very admirably. 

I too acknowledge the work of the project team, Caitlin, Anne and Andrew. It's really lovely to see Caitlin and Anne here, who have gone back to their normal substantive roles. The fact that they're here to see the passage of these motions shows how invested they were in this work, and I know they spent a long time on it. Thank you to the three of you for the work you've done.

There has been a lot of work done already, and I know it's not necessarily things that have been seen publicly or even by members, but as a member of the committee, we've had really regular reporting about the work that has been undertaken. I acknowledge that that work has been ongoing. Particularly, I want to acknowledge the work of the clerks, both of this place and of the House of Assembly and the staff that have been supporting the clerks because it hasn't been them on their own. 

There's been a really significant amount of reform that's taken place and a lot of that hasn't been easy. For the clerks to have led that work, but also for the staff in this place who have had to adapt and change the way they've done things for a very long time. I believe a lot of this work has been long overdue and it's not ever easy to implement the type of change and the scale of change that we've seen be led over this period. I know that's been really difficult for a lot of people. I acknowledge the openness that people have come to that with and the changes that have been implemented that really have been about making this a safer, more respectful workplace for everyone, particularly for all of those staff. 

I too want to put on record that this work has been done with no extra resourcing. The clerks have invested a huge amount of time and effort into this and there has been significant change. They've been expected to do that without additional resourcing, and that has not been easy. I want to put that on record and really acknowledge the work that's been done. 

Mr President, for yourself as a presiding officer and for the Speaker of the other place. I know a lot of the work has been led by the presiding officers and again, I want to acknowledge that that work has been done and has impacted on this place in a positive way.

I will speak briefly to the three motions, as the member for Murchison has done as well, because they are closely linked. I support all three of these, but there are some comments that I wanted to get on record. Starting with the code of conduct, this has been a lengthy piece of work. It has been very thorough. It's been well consulted, and I want to thank those members of parliament who took up that opportunity to have input into this. It is important, and it was something the committee were mindful of, that we didn't want to be seen to be imposing these motions on anyone and we wanted these to be owned by the members of parliament who will be impacted by them, and who hopefully will be endorsing them. It was pleasing to see a number of members engage with that process, have a say and be involved.

You would think a lot of this is common sense. It would be nice if it was. A lot of it probably is common sense for a lot of people, but unfortunately, it's not always. I think it's a timely reminder for all of us about always being mindful of our actions.

It's disappointing that there's been incidences quite recently of conversations in corridors between members of parliament and staff that I would suggest were not appropriate. Certainly the members of staff felt that it wasn't appropriate enough to talk about it in conversation. I'm not going to speak about specifics because I don't think that's fair to anyone, but I think this is a really good reminder for all of us to be mindful of our actions and how we conduct ourselves with other people. Often, it's about how our behaviour is perceived by others, rather than how we intend it. I think that's always difficult for people, because we all have different ways of behaving and speaking with each other and different manners. We might not intend for something to come across in the way that it's perceived, but we just need to be really mindful of that.

We hold such a position of privilege and responsibility in this place, and the example we set here is so important. We need to remember that this is a workplace for many people who don't have that same level of privilege and responsibility that we have, but also we need to remember the example that we're setting for others. I think this week is a really great example. I'm never going to be one to say that we can't have robust debates and that people can't even get angry. 

You know, there's always a lot of reflection on question time in the other place. I have to say, often it's comments about women, that women should conduct ourselves better and that we don't have the right to be angry. Of course we do. We're all working in a job where we're passionate about what we do. I would be really disappointed if we lost that from this place, because I think that adds a lot to what we do and it means that we're invested in it.

What I really wanted to comment on today is the example that we set in terms of how we deal with each other. I hope the member for Mersey won't mind me saying, but I know that the member for Mersey today in particular has sent an email to all of the members about the week we've got ahead of us, and that it is a difficult week. I think that email and the responses to it from many members is a really beautiful example of the way that, particularly in this place, but I know it happens in the other place as well, that we do really look after each other and we do support each other. I just think we need to remember that in terms of the example that we're setting for those debates that take place outside of this place as well.

The alcohol and other drugs statement: I have to admit, I'm normally someone who has reservations about these types of policies, because I always have reservations about policies that put restrictions on people that are not really about the behaviour that's being exhibited. I'm really pleased to see that this has been constructed in the way that it has, and that it's really about all of us as members of parliament making a statement about our behaviour, and acknowledging that alcohol and drug use can contribute to harmful behaviours, as the member for Murchison pointed out.

We do work in a different workplace than many other workplaces. We are often here for long hours. We often have meals, sometimes three meals in the same day, in this place. I think that's probably what we're looking at today. We are in a different type of workplace, but we need to remember also that it's not that for everyone in this place, that it is a workplace with a very broad range of roles and experiences.

What I really do support in this statement is that it is about our behaviour. It's not about restricting anyone, but it's about just reminding and making a statement that we acknowledge that our behaviour is important and the way we conduct ourselves in this workplace is important, particularly for those who are around us. The third - well, third in my order, anyway - the motion to establish the independent complaints commissioner and deputy commissioner - which again, I'm very supportive of, but just a couple of comments I really wanted to put on record here.

This can't happen without adequate resourcing. We have had debate in the committee around whether we do this as a resolution, or what mechanism we use to establish this. I'm supportive of the idea that it's a resolution, because it is a statement from all of us, then, that this is something that we want to establish. It is a little different in that the work is not then being led by the government. The preparation hasn't been able to be done. The resourcing hasn't been allocated. There hasn't been that piece of work that we would normally see with a legislated commission or establishment of a commission. So we just need to be mindful of that.

This motion contains timelines. It's putting the responsibility for this onto the presiding officers. We can't hold the presiding officers accountable to that if that resourcing is not provided. I'm interested to hear the response, presumably from the Leader for the Government rather than member for McIntyre, although I'd be very happy to hear both, of course, and when this motion is debated in the other place too, to hear that commitment from the government that they will be committing to adequate resourcing, because if we're going to do this, we need to make sure that it's done well.

I don't think it's as simple as just appointing a complaints commissioner and a deputy because there's obviously infrastructure and resources that need to go around that, and this government does not have a great track record of adequately resourcing accountability bodies. If we look at the Integrity Commission and the Tasmanian Audit Office, those bodies are often talking about how their work is being impacted by lack of resources. If we're going to do this, we need to make sure that it's done well, because people should be able to have confidence that if they do put in a complaint that it is dealt with properly, that there is a robust process and that those complaints will be handled in an appropriate way.

I support all three motions, but in particular that motion with the Independent Complaints Commissioner: we have to get that resourcing right. We have to see that it is unusual. We're in the middle of a budget cycle. The timelines are not going to match up with the next budget, so we will need to see some kind of commitment from the government to make sure that that role is resourced properly, not only in an ongoing way, but in the adequate resourcing to establish it and get it set up well, so that we're not just saying we're going to do this, we're actually going to do it. I will conclude there. I support the motions and I'm happy to see this through the parliament before the end of the year.

[12.52 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I, like the member for Rumney who's spoken, will combine the contribution from the government into the one as the honourable member for Murchison, the mover of the motion, did, I believe, rather than take three opportunities. I will do my best to cut out what I don't need as I make my way forward.

I rise to address the motions, the first one being the alcohol and drugs member statement, and acknowledge that the motion reflects an important recommendation from the Motion for Respect Report and Workplace Culture Oversight Committee's findings. Before I move on to the key points, I also want to place on the record, not only on behalf of the government but as the member for McIntyre, my acknowledgement of the work that has been put in by the committee. It is particularly nice to see the panel members here as well today and to see the next part of the work that they have provided to the parliament, acknowledging the work and I endorse the comments made by the member for Rumney. I couldn't have said it any better myself, so why would I?

The Motion for Respect Report identified alcohol as a contributing factor for harassment and unsafe behaviour in parliamentary settings. This motion acknowledges that risk, links it to work health and safety obligations and commits members to the responsible consumption of alcohol and bystander intervention. The Workplace Culture Oversight Committee second interim report reinforced the need for cultural expectations around responsible consumption, and acknowledged a first step for members is recognising the risk associated with alcohol in the workplace. 

I believe this statement delivers those expectations. It certainly sets out clear acknowledgements: impairment increases work health and safety risks, alcohol correlates with harassment and members' roles do not excuse irresponsible behaviour. It commits members to managing risks, respecting non-drinkers and intervening where inappropriate behaviours occur. While this is a positive cultural signal, it's noted it is not enforceable. The Motion for Respect Report recommended stronger policy levers and accountability measure, and while this motion does not create sanctions, it does articulate a set of standards for acceptable behaviour, which is certainly a positive move in the right direction. The statement is a practical measure setting the standard of behaviour expected by members.

This statement progresses the cultural intent of the review by embedding shared responsibility and prevention principles. It is a step forward in shaping a respectful parliamentary environment.

In regard to the code of conduct for members of the Legislative Council, recognising the development of this is the cornerstone of cultural reform and it responds directly to the motion of respect report. Again, the workplace culture oversight committees call for enforceable standards.

 The motion of respect report recommended a clear, enforceable code of conduct for members to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all staff. This motion delivers that through principles and enforceable standards. The code establishes:

Respect for the rule of law, the separation of powers and ethical leadership;
Recognition of Tasmania's Aboriginal peoples and their enduring connection to Country;
A commitment to safety, particularly for children and vulnerable people;
Zero tolerance for bullying, harassment, discrimination and victimisation; 
Clear expectations around conflicts of interest, lobbying and the use of public resources;
Mandatory induction and training for all members;
An independent complaints process with proportionate and evidence-based outcomes. 

The code also provides for regular review and the publication of interpretive guidelines to support members in meeting their obligations. The Workplace Culture Oversight Committee emphasised induction, review and independent oversight, which is noted and reflected in this code.

Part 1 of the proposed code sets principles: respect, integrity, cultural recognition and safety. 

Part 2 introduces enforceable standards in workplace behaviour, conflicts of interest, lobbying, online conduct including AI, confidentiality and mandatory induction. 

Part 3 establishes governance, ethics advice, training, complaints processes and review.

A clear strength in the proposed code is that it embeds work, health and safety duties and explicitly prohibits bullying, harassment and discrimination. These are core recommendations in the motion of respect report, and it's pleasing to see that the code seeks to address emerging risks such as online behaviour and AI use. The code reflects the intent of the work and the recommendations of the motion of respect report and lays the foundation for accountability and cultural change.

In regard to the Independent Complaints Commissioner, which was the third part of those motions, the motion for respect report calls for strengthening of the currently limited mechanisms for responding to complaints regarding the conduct of parliamentarians, and places a strong emphasis on independence, procedural fairness.

The Council suspended from 1 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.


QUESTIONS

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=38.9_D=5.4_C=0.72] New Ice Rink in Hobart

Ms THOMAS question to MINISTER for SPORT, Mr DUIGAN 

[2.30 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=49.4_D=29.7_C=0.80] Over 12 months ago the government announced it had opened a process to test investor interest in developing a new ice rink in Hobart. On 13 December 2024 a pre-registration of interest commenced, encouraging interested parties to submit their registration of interest via a form found on the Infrastructure Tasmania website. My questions are as follows:

Has the registration of interest process been finalised?

What was the  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=79.2_D=21.0_C=0.81] outcome?

Did the government undertake an assessment of the suitability of any available land for a new ice rink?

 Does the government intend to take any further assessments to identify the availability and suitability of land for an ice rink?

Does the government intend to pursue a public private partnership for an ice rink and is there any funding for ice sports in the 2025-26 Budget?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=103.1_D=1.8_C=0.87]  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=109.4_D=6.0_C=0.67]  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=117.9_D=2.1_C=0.77] Mr President, I thank the member for the question.  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=121.6_D=25.8_C=0.81] Earlier this year the Tasmanian government held a pre-registration of interest ROI for experienced parties with an interest in delivering an ice sport facility and this was of course to better understand market interest for the delivery, investment and development of a new ice rink prior to embarking on the potential next steps for the project. 

Ice sports and recreation is a niche market in Australia. It requires different infrastructure elements  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=147.7_D=20.1_C=0.82] compared to more traditional sports and skilled operators to ensure that the rink is maintained to the standard required by users. I understand the ROI report adds to the findings of the Tasmanian Ice Rink Feasibility Study, which found private investment would be needed to support any viable ice sports and recreational facility for the state through a public private partnership.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=168.3_D=7.3_C=0.86] The details of the report have been shared with Ice Sports Tasmania. Our next steps for this project are being considered and  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=177.3_D=5.6_C=0.84] we continue to liaise closely with organisations to progress these plans.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=183.9_D=3.6_C=0.76] We understand that the Glenorchy City Council has previously supported  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=188.9_D=14.5_C=0.88] in-principle making a location available for a facility, however, the suitability of the site and the details of the offer have not necessarily been fully clarified. 

In the meantime, we would support Ice Sports Tasmania approaching the Australian Government for funding. The government is currently working with a private proponent on a new development and the avenues available for government support. Once this process is finalised  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=219.9_D=6.9_C=0.88] the opportunity to engage with local government to ascertain interest in hosting the development will be undertaken also.


AFL and Stadiums Queensland Arrangement

Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER for SPORT and EVENTS Mr DUIGAN

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=233.2_D=26.8_C=0.81] [2.34 p.m.]
Is the minister aware that the AFL is considering walking, if indeed it has not already walked, away from its arrangement over the Gold Coast Stadium, a stadium that is a venue of a 27,000 seat capacity,  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=260.9_D=2.8_C=0.91] servicing a population of about 700,000?

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=265.0_D=20.5_C=0.84] There's a story on Tasmanian Times which says the AFL is handing the keys back to Stadiums Queensland after failing to generate anticipated revenue from the venue. So, there has been a management deal with the AFL over the stadium in the Gold Coast which has collapsed.  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=287.2_D=7.2_C=0.86] Are you aware of this development, and do you see that it has some implications for the viability of the stadium you and your government are so shamelessly promoting?

 [Bookmark: Phr21_O=294.8_D=1.8_C=0.52]  [Bookmark: Phr22_O=298.1_D=6.4_C=0.64] ANSWER

Mr President, I might just seek some advice. I'm not aware of the article about which you speak, nor any implications relevant to Tasmania.


Requesting of Information into the AFL Stadium Deal

Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER for SPORT and EVENTS, Mr DUIGAN - 

[2.36 p.m.]
Will you avail yourself of some of the information so that you have the necessary information at your disposal to understand about the viability of these large stadia where we've even got the AFL itself walking away from management of the stadium because it is not financially viable for them. Would you avail yourself of that information?

ANSWER

Mr President, thank you. Yes.


Wisby's School Bus Service - Kingston

Ms WEBB question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

I've got a question, I think for the Leader of Government, who's going to do it today for the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport in his absence. The question is regarding school bus services within Spring Farm and Whitewater Park estates, which are in Kingston and part of my electorate. Can you confirm that at the beginning of the 2025 school year, the Department of State Growth engaged Wisby's Buses Pty Ltd to service Spring Farm and Whitewater Park estates for students at Kingston High and Kingston Primary schools, but unfortunately failed at the time to explore extending this new service to accommodate other non-government schools in the area including St Aloysius Catholic College, which is attended by many children living in those suburbs.
Further, can you confirm that you have received correspondence from the college and parents including supportive material from Wisby's Buses advising the company would be happy to implement a contract change as the required route change would only add an extra 7.6 kilometres each day, an additional 4 minutes to the current schedule, and could also accommodate children attending the Tarremah Steiner School nearby.

Given the demonstrated demand, the benefits and the minimal impact of the current service, are you considering acting upon the request for a minor adjustment to the existing Kingston school bus route, and will you undertake to have done so in time for the commencement of the 2026 school year?

ANSWER

Mr President, thank you. On behalf of minister Vincent, I will answer this question. The Department of State Growth is legislatively required to observe the school bus eligibility guidelines when assessing new services or extensions to existing services. The guidelines do not allow for State Growth to fund new or extended services to support travel beyond local government schools. This includes travel to government schools beyond the local intake area and non-government schools. This is because doing so may impact school enrolment patterns and funding which over time may impact community growth and the cost of supporting local schools.

It is important to note section 1 (d) (i) of the guidelines stipulate service extensions can only also service nearby state, catholic and independent schools without compromising the travel time and arrival and departure time of students to the core schools. Extending the Wisby's Buses' Spring Farm route to St Aloysius Catholic College would increase the total distance of the service and compromise both the afternoon departure time from Kingston Primary School and Kingston High School, both of which are core schools for the route and the overall travel time. It's also acknowledged that advice from the bus operator suggests incorporating the college would only require an additional 4 minutes, however this refers to arrival times, not overall travel time.

In the afternoon, arriving in Spring Farm four minutes later than currently requires the service to depart core schools ten minutes earlier, for a total distance of 14 minutes. This means students catching the bus from core schools will experience much longer bus trips than they otherwise would. It's understood, the concerns of parents living in the area and the minister will instruct State Growth to continue to watch the development of Spring Farm and Whitewater Park and the demand for bus services in the area to different schools.

Changes over time may result - this is positive - may result in amendments to services which make the inclusion of other nongovernment schools more viable. In the meantime, where services do not meet the guidelines are desired, schools can make private arrangements or deliver services themselves. The affected constituents may wish to discuss this with Catholic Education Tasmania as an alternative resolution, but there was a couple of positives there.


Homes Tasmania

Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER for HOUSING, Mr VINCENT, referred to LEADER for the GOVERNMENT in the LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Ms RATTRAY

[2.40 p.m.]
I believe there is an answer to a question I put on notice that the Leader for the government can provide. Can the government detail to the Council how many social housing homes and how many affordable homes, Homes Tasmania has been primarily responsible for delivering since it came into being on 1 December 2022?

ANSWER

Mr President, again, on behalf of the Minister for Housing and Planning, Mr Vincent, the answer is from Holmes Tasmania's inception in 2022 through to 18 November 2025, Homes Tasmania advises it has built 480 homes. This consists of 235 social housing properties, 140 supported accommodations and 105 homeless accommodations.

Homes Tasmania has also assisted community housing providers with the delivery of an additional 886 properties. Of these, 815 are social housing, 3 supported accommodations and 62 affordable housing and six homeless accommodations.


MOTIONS

Alcohol and Drugs Members' Statement

Resumed from above (page xx).

[2.42 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I will go back to the key points. The motion for respect report calls for strengthening of the currently limited mechanisms for responding to complaints regarding the conduct of parliamentarians and places a strong emphasis on independence, procedural fairness and victim centric processes. It's appreciated this motion responds to those priorities.

The Workplace Culture Oversight Committee has also highlighted the need for sanctions and remedies to be proportionate to the seriousness of the breach of the code.

Transparency and regular reporting. These principles are embedded in the model through structured processes and mandatory annual reporting requirements.

It is pleasing to note the motion proposes to include a confidential intake process for complaints, ensuring privacy and safety for those who come forward. It also responds to the importance of achieving early conciliation where feasible and where necessary formal investigate and, where necessary, formal investigations of breaches of the code of conduct. This motion creates a clear and independent pathway for handling complaints. It strikes an important balance between the confidentiality and parliamentary privilege, while ensuring that sanctions are proportionate to the nature and the severity of the breach. While this model is a significant step forward, it's noted it does not fully respond to the Motion for Respect vision of a holistic system covering all parliamentary participants. Its scope is focused on members and those who interact with them professionally, leaving broader cultural issues to be addressed through other mechanisms.

The cost considerations of establishing and maintaining the office of the commissioner is acknowledged. Establishing a new office for an independent complaints commissioner could require significant funding for staffing, infrastructure and ongoing operational costs, but an alternative option for the Commissioner and deputy Commissioner being held on a retainer is provided by this motion. This provides a more cost effective but equally fit for purpose model. The committee has noted models as such that are operated by the ACT Legislative Assembly in which the speaker engages an independent commissioner on a retainer. There is no bureaucracy supporting the commissioner and the Assembly is able to review the commissioner's work from time to time in order to revise the retainer.

In this motion, the committee has proposed the appointment of a commissioner and deputy commissioner on the basis of gender balance. The committee has not recommended the employment of any other persons. This structure is based on the most economical approach for a parliament made-up of two houses and 50 members, while gender balance ensures that complainants who are victims of certain conduct can feel safe coming forward and providing information.

This motion delivers on the intent of the review by embedding independence and fairness into the complaints process. It represents an important step towards creating a safer and more accountable parliamentary workforce. Should there be a need for additional resources to ensure the model is supported, then the government will of course consider those matters. The motions are supported.

[2.46 p.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - Mr President, I'm very pleased to stand here today, after this enormous body of work has been done to improve the culture in this shared workplace, to say the Greens will be supporting the three motions which are within the order of business for today.

This work that's been undertaken by the Workplace Culture Committee, by Andrew Young and his team, it really matters, because not only is it important that we have a safe and respectful workplace, it is also important out in the wider community that we model respectful, ethical behaviour and uphold the highest standards of integrity. We are in a position of great public trust. We have a very significant responsibility that sits on our shoulders, a responsibility to represent our communities, hold government accountable and push for legislative and policy reform in the public interest.

It's never been so evident as it is for all of us in this place this week, the weight of that responsibility that sits on this Council's shoulders. Despite the fact we're in positions of trust, despite this significant responsibility and trust that voters bestow on us, it is fair to say that the profession that members of parliament represent, is not held in the highest esteem. There has been an erosion of trust in elected representatives and of course that infects people's faith in our democracy.

It really matters that here in this place, we are seen as a safe, respectful, ethical workplace, where it doesn't matter what role you fill in ministerial and parliamentary services, you feel safe and validated. You feel there's a code of conduct that is agreed to and accepted. And you know that if you have an issue or see misconduct or unethical behaviour, there is somewhere for you to take that complaint.

Today we debate the establishment of an independent complaints commissioner, so I do want to just reflect only briefly on how we got here. There has over the years in this place been incidents of absolutely disgraceful behaviour. We saw through the the Bolt report the culture of this place was hurting people, harming people. If we just go to some of the findings of the number of people who responded to the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner's callout for feedback on the culture of this place, it's really confronting.

All of the ministerial and parliamentary workplace - all of the MPS workplace - was surveyed. More than half of people who were surveyed responded: 56.5 per cent. Nearly a full quarter, 24 per cent of people, who responded to the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner's survey said they had experienced discrimination in this workplace. In the survey, 15 per cent of people who responded experienced sexual harassment in this workplace, while 40 per cent, not that far from half of respondents, had experienced bullying in the ministerial and parliamentary services workplace, and only 11 per cent of those who witnessed these behaviours intervened. That is a terrible failure of bystander principles.

Importantly, in the survey 82 per cent of respondents expressed general dissatisfaction with the complaints processes. The commissioner found that bullying was the most common form of inappropriate conduct in the MPS workplace. The commissioner made a number of recommendations which have brought us to this place today. There was a 10-point list of recommendations, and I'm really pleased to say, as someone who was in the other place when this report came down, and was the leader of the Greens at that time, that following receipt of the Bolt report, immediate steps were taken to address those recommendations. 

One of the first steps saw the Premier; the Leader of the Opposition; me; I believe the honourable member for Nelson, Ms Webb, was there after doing so much work to bring us to this place; and we made a public statement accepting responsibility for the cultural failings of ministerial and parliamentary services. Then this place worked through these 10 steps.

It was a deeply confronting body of work. I think it showed those of us who had not been mistreated or affected by bullying in this workplace what it's really been like for a lot of people who work in here. Let's be frank about this, it will mostly be staff, whether it's in a ministerial office or another political office, who are experiencing or who have experienced the fallout of a toxic and unsafe culture. The reason for that is because within this place, by its very nature, there is a power imbalance.

I agree with the honourable member for Rumney in her comments on the alcohol and drugs members statement, and some members who've been here for some time will know that while it's not perfect now, it's very different from what it was 10 years ago: particularly different from what it was 15 or 20 years ago. In my experience, there was a lot more heavy drinking here in the past. 

I will tell a short story about the former leader of the Labor Party, Bryan Green, who had, and it was his own fault, been busted for drink driving. It became the subject of a media story. We were in government at the time. I remember we were sitting on the government side of the benches and Mr Green, having been downstairs in the bar for dinner and no doubt a glass or three of wine to go with it, [Bookmark: Phr2_O=16.1_D=2.3_C=0.94]  knew he had to apologise [Bookmark: Phr3_O=19.5_D=6.7_C=0.90]  for his conduct, and apologised for getting caught [Bookmark: Phr4_O=27.9_D=4.4_C=0.94] . In those days [Bookmark: Phr5_O=34.1_D=9.6_C=0.92]  drinking a fair bit in the dining room was reasonably normal; it's certainly not considered so now, and that's a good thing.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=44.9_D=27.2_C=0.88] I came from an old journalistic family and my father used to spend a lot of time at the pub; he always said as a journalist that's where he found his best stories. Thankfully, I don't think that's the way journalists think now, but we've come a long way from where we've been. It doesn't mean that the behaviours and practices here now in relation to alcohol and other drugs [Bookmark: Phr7_O=74.2_D=14.0_C=0.88]  are exemplary, but this is quite a nuanced members' statement where it is on each of us to take responsibility for our consumption of alcohol in this workplace [Bookmark: Phr8_O=88.8_D=29.6_C=0.86] , knowing that the consumption of alcohol can lead to inappropriate behaviours, aggression, bullying, uninhibited behaviours, and that's exactly the sort of behaviour we don't want or need in this place, which is the heart of our democracy. Isn't it a shame that we had a code of conduct for members of parliament that was [Bookmark: Phr9_O=118.4_D=6.0_C=0.91]  brought into place in 2018 that sounds great. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=125.3_D=5.3_C=0.89]  It has so much in it that is good. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=132.6_D=15.0_C=0.90]  Even the opening preamble:

Members of parliament recognise that their actions have an impact on the lives of all Tasmanian people. Fulfilling their obligations and discharging their duties responsibly requires a commitment to the highest ethical standards to maintain [Bookmark: Phr12_O=147.7_D=27.8_C=0.88]  and strengthen the democratic traditions of the state and the integrity of its institutions. 

It says:

Members are expected to promote and support this code by leadership and example. 

It reminds us of the values that we are to embody in this place. We are, it says, 'to value the public interest and the fundamental objective of public office to act solely in the terms of the public interest'. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=177.2_D=0.6_C=0.74]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=178.2_D=30.0_C=0.87]  Some people's perception of what the public interest is will be different from others. I might stand here and argue it is manifestly against the public interest to build a $2 billion stadium at Macquarie Point because of the impact that that will have on the people of Tasmania. Another person in here speaking for government may genuinely believe it is in the public interest to build that stadium. So again, there are [Bookmark: Phr15_O=208.2_D=11.4_C=0.84]  subjective tests sometimes to these good intentions. It reminds us that we have to carefully manage and declare conflicts of interest [Bookmark: Phr16_O=221.4_D=4.4_C=0.94] , not to misuse our positions or public resources [Bookmark: Phr17_O=228.1_D=1.2_C=0.88] . It [Bookmark: Phr18_O=231.4_D=6.6_C=0.93]  says:

A member must only make statements in parliament and in public that are, to the best of their knowledge, accurate and honest.
 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=238.6_D=15.6_C=0.87] 
That is not what happens in this place. It's not what happens every Question Time in the House of Assembly. I watched it again only this morning to see wilful misleading happening in the other place [Bookmark: Phr20_O=254.7_D=6.0_C=0.93]  in Question Time, in the face of facts [Bookmark: Phr21_O=261.3_D=9.6_C=0.87]  and information that is there from a statutory authority in black and white. So, my point here is you can have [Bookmark: Phr22_O=272.6_D=14.4_C=0.88]  the best-written and agreed-upon code of conduct in the Westminster system, but unless there is an acceptance of the need to change and an embrace of reform [Bookmark: Phr23_O=287.9_D=2.1_C=0.93] , clearl [Bookmark: Phr24_O=291.4_D=13.6_C=0.91] y a written code of conduct like the one we've had in place here for seven years doesn't hold much water, and it is highly regrettable that we have had to go through what became a collectively traumatic experience of the Bolt report, which laid the failings of this place bare, to rewrite a code of conduct that has enforceable provisions in it, because the previous code of conduct couldn't improve the culture of this place, Mr President. Highly, highly regrettable. It's a strong body of work. I know it's taken a lot of work and a lot of conversations and testing of ideas within the committee, but also talking to people outside the committee to put forward a code of conduct, an alcohol and drug member statement, and the process and the structure for the Independent Complaints Commissioner, but I believe what we have here is something quite close to best practice.

The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association prepared a paper detailing standards for codes of conduct for members of parliament and the parliamentary workplace, and the motions that we are debating today reflect a significant amount of the CPA's work on what is best practice -

Ms Forrest - They have a similar author.

Ms O'CONNOR - Is that right?

Ms Forrest - Correct.

Ms O'CONNOR - No wonder it's so well done. A similar author says the member for Murchison, which means that the person who we've been able to rely on these past 18 months, two years, Mr Andrew Young, obviously had previous experience in working across the parliament on developing what is the best -

Ms Forrest - It's such an excellent point because of that.

Ms O'CONNOR - Such a set of best practice standards for parliament. In a way, I'm sorry we're here. We're here because not enough people within this workplace, when they signed on to the code of conduct, lived it and manifested it in their professional life, but what we have here is something good, but it's also strong and there should be sanctions for any breach of this code. As we know, at a certain point it will be to the Houses, through the privileges committees, to determine how to deal with those breaches of expected ethical and behavioural standards but that, of course, is as it should be because each House needs to be the manager of its own business and its own people, in a democratic system.

I hope that the result of this, and we've seen some cultural change already, just through this process, and I too want to acknowledge the work of the clerks and the people who work with the clerks, but the result of this needs to permeate this whole place, both Houses, all of ministerial and parliamentary services, and when we sign on to this code of conduct it has to be with the understanding that it comes with a responsibility, but also it comes with very clear expectations that we will attend ethics training, that we will accept the fact that we can't know at all, and even those of us who think we are good, ethical people will have things to learn about appropriate behaviours in the workplace, changing standards because in this workplace, we attract some of the finest people across politics.

We attract, whether it is working to the parliament or to an MP or to a minister, we know that we attract some of the best and the brightest because it's a great place to work, but for too many people, historically, and hopefully not to this day, it has not been a safe place to work. If we want to continue to attract those amazing people who come to work with us; if we want to continue to attract people to run for political life who are there to do the right thing, we have to understand that culture begins with each of us  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.6_D=15.6_C=0.90] and when you lift the culture of a place, you lift everything about it. It makes for a happier, more productive, more effective workplace, which is much more likely to make decisions  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=43.3_D=16.6_C=0.86] solely based on the public interest. 

I thank everyone who has been part of this journey, and I want to acknowledge again the work of the member for Nelson in bringing us to this point, because it was through the member for Nelson's work  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=60.1_D=16.1_C=0.86] to raise these issues that the Bolt report was initiated, and I always believe in giving credit where it is due. I thank the committee and everyone who sat on the committee, from the chair to the President to the Speaker of the other place to  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=76.8_D=21.8_C=0.84] the leaders of the three political parties.

Ms Forrest - It has been changed over the journey because of changing positions. 

Ms O'CONNOR - I did wonder that because I have seen faces change on the committee, but regardless of that, the committee did a great job and we should all be thankful for the work that has gone into these motions and we should all support them wholeheartedly.
 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=100.0_D=3.0_C=0.78] 
[3.06 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=106.2_D=17.9_C=0.88] Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, I rise to make some brief comments here and really to endorse the contributions of other members that have spoken at more length and very well on the importance of what we are contemplating here today and how pleased we all are to see progress made on it.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=125.8_D=10.5_C=0.83] I also absolutely acknowledge the importance of that Bolt report the motion for respect. It was prompted around the time there were some  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=136.7_D=14.9_C=0.74] similar reviews being undertaken in parliaments in different jurisdictions, and it was the Brittany Higgins incident in federal parliament that prompted me to write to then premier Gutwein to suggest that we undertake a similar workplace culture review here in this parliament.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=151.8_D=18.8_C=0.89] He very promptly responded to that and got the work underway for the Bolt review and then the subsequent report from that. 

I think that has been a real fundamental seismic shift actually as a result of that in a positive direction. Of course [Bookmark: Phr11_O=171.1_D=17.2_C=0.89]  that report, valuable though is, is just a report on a shelf unless it's actioned and so the work of the committee that was formed and has progressed since the time of the report has been absolutely fundamental to making sure that what we see is tangible change and real progress. Sometimes that seemed a bit slow, but here we are with something really important [Bookmark: Phr12_O=189.3_D=24.0_C=0.78]  to be agreeing on today and to see come into effect once it's been dealt with here and in the other place. 

I would also particularly like to thank the committee members who have been progressing this work and all those other MPs and individuals who've contributed into the work  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=214.0_D=2.8_C=0.93] through feedback or through participation in some way.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=217.5_D=22.6_C=0.82] There has clearly been exemplary work done by the project team, Mr Andrew Young and the rest of the team members who have done this and underpinning the work with the committee to bring this to us today, so thank you so much for that.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=241.6_D=5.7_C=0.77] I am also aware - and others have mentioned it and I want to just make note of it too and add my recognition to  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=247.8_D=3.9_C=0.72] the work of the clerks across this period of time. There has already been  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=253.4_D=15.0_C=0.87] significant structural and cultural changes afoot, which were needed and have already begun making good change in this workplace for all who enter it and work within it. 

These three pieces of work, just very briefly, I am not going to go into detail on them other than just to raise a couple of things that perhaps have either not been touched on yet or things that I would like to particularly emphasise.  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=269.6_D=9.6_C=0.81]  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=280.8_D=17.1_C=0.83] They are certainly there to assist us in ensuring that this is a safe and respectful workplace, and a code of conduct is very fundamental to that effort. It was important to update what we had in place, which was not sufficient and what we are going to have now as a result of this is a much more fit-for-purpose document, which hopefully then becomes a living culture once it is in place. That will only happen if we do engage in that training work, we need to engage in. If we engage in attitudinal change and monitoring of ourselves that we are actually living the intent of the code of conduct. I'm one for professional development and training of MPs. It's a sticky subject. No one can tell us what to do, it would appear. I've always argued this on some other matters to do with public accountability around MPs.

There should be public reporting of training undertaken by MPs. There should be public reporting of whether MPs, have a working with children card. We can't be forced to have one. I think it's appropriate and fair all citizens and voters understand about all MPs, whether they A) have a working with vulnerable people card and B), whether they've engaged or are engaging in ongoing professional development and training. That should be something that's publicly reported on somewhere in the public domain. It can become a piece of information that an informed electorate has about their members representing them, and then also about people who might be asking for their vote or support in future elections.

I don't know whether that's the intention, that there'll be some form of reporting about training engaged in and who's up to date with their training or who's engaged in it or not, but there should be in my view. I'm interested in terms of the code of conduct application, and I raised this in the briefing. There may be an answer, or it may have been addressed in the member for Murchison's opening remarks, and I missed it, because I was focusing on reading material at the time, on whether the code of conduct applies during election periods.

Here in this place, we are MPs and acting and employed as MPs right up to our election day. We don't have an an election period as such where there's any question over whether we would be covered by a code of conduct. Of course, in the other place there's a prorogation and then there's a period of time during which ministers are still ministers, but members of parliament who are running for re-election aren't technically regarded as MPs during that time. Certainly in the eyes of our Integrity Commission, that's the case, because we've already had that addressed in this state, that complaints made to the Integrity Commission about things that occurred during election period, about an MP who's running for re-election can't be addressed by our Integrity Commission because technically that person's not an MP and not covered by the remit of the Integrity Commission.

It's probably important for us to understand if and how this code of conduct may apply to MPs who are running for re-election and during that election period. When I say MPs, I mean MPs in the other place, because of course that does apply to us in this place.

Ms Forrest - Except for the few days when you don't know whether you've won the seat or not.

Ms WEBB - There's a tiny period of time. Yes, true. Well, sometimes it's not a tiny period, 10 days can feel really long, can't it?

Ms Forrest - The election has already been had then too.

Ms WEBB - Yes, people have made their choices.

Ms Forrest - Yeah, you can't do much after that.

Ms WEBB - The complaints commissioner's role, is an excellent role to have in place. Two things will be crucial for it to successfully complete the work its tasked with. One will be the appointment process. And then we arrive at having a person in place in that role and the deputy commissioner role. There can be no question that all MPs have full faith in the person who has been selected in a way that's accountable and rigorous and able to be delivering full confidence. That they can undertake that role appropriately. That's something for us to be observing as we go forward, whether we've framed up here to successfully deliver.

The second thing is resourcing and the ability to do that role. It's far too common a story in this jurisdiction for us to see statutory entities, oversight entities, integrity entities be underfunded and not able to fully do their job. I'm assuming that is not going to be the case here, that we will be equipping this role and the people who are in it to do the job that they have to do and be available to do that fully. We'll be waiting to see how that plays out over time.

Cultural change is fundamental alongside these documents and the words on a page. It is fundamental to the success of actually delivering what we want to see delivered in terms of a safe and respectful workplace. I note that comments were made acknowledging the potential there can be a weaponisation potentially of complaints processes, and that's something we'll need to be carefully observing and monitoring.

Essentially it still remains an interesting system here in this very unique place where at the end of the day, MPs are policing MPs. That's as it is, and these arrangements here give us some more accountable and clear mechanisms where things can be dealt with more appropriately and independently. It helps to work against the more problematic aspects of self-policing.

That's the extent of my contribution. I didn't mention the alcohol and drug statement, but of course, that's a fairly straightforward positive step for us to be taking. We have already seen culture change in this space in this place. This helps us to focus our minds on what we are all agreeing is appropriate and necessary to provide safety and respect in our workplace.

I am very pleased to be supporting this motion to bring these things forward and to see them, once they've been dealt with here and in the other place, hopefully come into effect. Then we observe and see where we get to from here. All of us should feel more comfortable, and hopefully all staff in this place feel more comfortable, once these things are in place, and feel supported and safe.

[3.17 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, I want to make a few comments. Again, I thank Andrew Young for flying over to be here in case I need a bit of further assistance in responding to members' questions. It's been really helpful and and he has been available to all members. I am sure they've had questions throughout this process, and I do thank the members who have engaged in that. It helps us all to own this much more consistently and that's really important.

I, too, have observed change over the last 20 years in this place. There are lots of reasons why. Some of it is the different people that come and go through the place who may have a different attitude to some of these matters. It does mean you still need to have a mechanism in place to make it really clear about the standards we expect in this place as a safe and respectful workplace.

I will go to a couple of points the Leader made. She referred to the expectation laid out in the motion for respect report by Sarah Bolt around the use of alcohol. The committee did look at this quite thoroughly, and we need to acknowledge this is a place where alcohol can be part of the way we entertain guests, ambassadors and others in this workplace. Some people would like to see - because they've told me this - a zero-alcohol policy, with every member being breathalysed on the way in and out the door. That doesn't really accurately reflect the type of workplace this is. The important thing is we acknowledge the harmful impact the consumption of alcohol can have on behaviour of individuals, and where that leads to a breach of the code of conduct under the enforceable standards, there is now a mechanism to respond. It relies on people doing the right thing, being humans, and respecting others. There is that link. That's why I spoke about them all together, because they are linked, and to think we could just pass one without the others would be quite ineffective.

It might have also been the the Leader who spoke about the code of conduct for members being limited to members rather than the broader workplace, or it might have been someone else. Sorry, I didn't write down who - 

Ms Rattray - No - 

Ms FORREST - It was? This is a code of conduct for members. There are other codes of conduct for other staff and other people in our workplace. What's been missing is a code of conduct that's fit for purpose for members. Ministers have their own ministerial code of conduct in addition to that, but it was also to enable a clear understanding of the interactions of those who work with or come into contact with members through their roles. So it's not a member of the public who can make a complaint under this; it is a staff member who's working directly with the member, or a member of a department that comes in to interact with a member on an ad hoc basis.

It's to ensure that if a member behaves contrary to the code that there is a mechanism now - or there will be after this has been through both Houses - to enable that complaint to be taken and progressed, whereas that absence of a independent complaints commission has meant that things are often just let go because it's not really appropriate, some would just be elevated to the privileges committee. So, this fills a really important gap, and it's independent and it's been really well considered, about how to make that work and work effectively. Hopefully it will be an underutilised resource that's available to the parliament. Anyway, that's a matter of seeing how it impacts.

A couple of members spoke about the importance of resourcing; it is critical. We can't have these sort of mechanisms put in place. The premier has committed publicly in other forums to resource the work that needs to be done. We have argued pretty feverishly, I might put, to ensure our House and our parliament has the resources it needs, particularly the clerks. I do thank and recognise and acknowledge members like the member for Rumney and Hobart and look, all members who have spoken, talking about the important role the clerks have had and the amount of work they've had to do off the side of their desks.

Now, there has been a bit more resourcing put into that area, but it's still put an enormous pressure on our Clerks to deal with legacy issues that were not addressed in the past. It is really important we do acknowledge that, and I was really pleased to hear the members acknowledging that too and recognising the enormous workload this has created, with very little additional resource, in fact no additional resources, for quite some time.

It's not just the resourcing of the independent complaints commission that will be needed, and that is a low-cost model, hopefully a very low-cost model in many respects, but the other thing that does require that resourcing is the training and induction. That cannot just happen. It does need to have some resource input into that. So that's a matter that I, as a member of the committee and other committee members on that committee, will continue to advocate with the government, with the Premier, to ensure that that occurs, because you can't put in place mechanisms to try and improve the workplace of this place for not just the members, but for all the people who work within it, if we do not resource these things.

It doesn't mean having heaps of money sloshing around in some bucket somewhere; it's about adequately resourcing it so that the requirements and expectations can be met. There was a question I think the member for Nelson raised about the training and the importance of professional development. I absolutely share your passion for that. I have always held a view that lifelong learning is one of my key values. 

At the point that we got to, there's been a bit of work done on this and there's more work to be done that we haven't completed or the recommendations yet within the Bolt report, but the way it sits at the moment is that a record of training will be kept by the clerks and can be provided to the independent complaints commissioner, should it be required, for the independent complaints commissioner to make a determination about if someone's done training and they have still breached a particular aspect, then maybe they need to do it again or there may be other training that person should do. So, it's really to help inform that process at this stage.

Ms Webb - I was more interested in public accountability about them being trained.

Ms FORREST - Yes, I understand, but sometimes we have to take smaller steps forward to get to the to the end point. We are dealing with a lot of humans in this place, and we have to take people with us and yes, trying to put into place something that may be a step too far for some people, where it would be better to accept what we can and move and progress from there, but I do hear you.

Ms Webb - Well, it's very good motivation when you know it's going to be in the annual report of the parliament, whether you have attended your training that year or not.

Ms FORREST - Yes, I don't disagree. 

Ms Webb - Without it, I think we will see lots of people who don't.

Ms FORREST - The other question the member for Nelson raised, and this has been talked about in other discussions, is the issue of whether members are members or not during election periods in the lower House. That's not the case for us because we remain members until the Election Day, because we keep working. It's a really vexed and difficult issue. As I think the member for Nelson alluded to as well, the Integrity Commission has run up against this same question [Bookmark: Phr3_O=16.8_D=26.1_C=0.73]  and challenge. It's not a clear answer there or a clear picture, and the risk is - we should all act like civil human beings wherever we're interacting, but if you have a different set of standards for people who are seeking re-election as opposed to a candidate who's never been a member and can come in and say whatever they like and behave in a certain way [Bookmark: Phr4_O=43.8_D=4.9_C=0.65] , that's something that I think - I was talking to Andrew about this recently [Bookmark: Phr5_O=50.0_D=11.6_C=0.82]  - maybe this is something that the member for Nelson's Electoral Matters Committee could look at. 

Do we need to look at the Electoral Act to look at how you deal with this question? I don't think this is the forum that can deal with that question [Bookmark: Phr6_O=62.7_D=29.7_C=0.83]  in this particular framework, but it may be something the Electoral Act could contemplate. Anyway, that's just a thought. But it is a question that there is no clear answer to and that's the truth, that's the answer. I can't give any further assurance than that because there isn't a clear answer to that. It's not just an issue for this mechanism; it's an issue for others. 

Ms Webb - Presumably the answer, then, is that it doesn't apply during an election period for the lower House, because if we can't answer the question now -

Ms FORREST - Most likely, but one would hope that people would act civilly.

Ms O'Connor - It doesn't. They are not MPs during the campaign.

Ms FORREST -  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=94.0_D=26.4_C=0.80] In the different briefings we've offered to members, there's been differing viewpoints put about the roles and responsibilities and the application of that position during that period. It's not a clear thing. In the meantime, we can deal with the matter before us, which is how members behave in this workplace when they are elected members [Bookmark: Phr8_O=121.1_D=2.2_C=0.82]  during that period, and that applies to all those members [Bookmark: Phr9_O=124.0_D=22.2_C=0.68]  that sit in both Houses. I do thank members for their contribution. I don't intend to speak on the other motions. Members have asked questions across it and hopefully that suffices, unless someone has a burning question and they are welcome to get up on the other motions, but at this point, I will move - 

That the amended motion related to the alcohol and other drugs motion be agreed to.

MOTION

Gambling Advertising at State-Owned and State-Funded Venues

[3.29 p.m.]
Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, I move - 

That the Legislative Council:

(1)	notes that gambling harm in Tasmania remains significant, with annual poker machine losses alone exceeding $190 million, and growing evidence linking exposure to gambling advertising with risky gambling behaviour and the grooming of children into gambling;

(2)	further notes the findings and recommendations of the Commonwealth House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs in its 2023 report You Win Some, You Lose More – Inquiry into Online Gambling and Its Impacts on Those Experiencing Gambling Harm, particularly Recommendation 26, which calls for the Australian Government, with the cooperation of the states and territories, to implement a comprehensive ban on all forms of gambling advertising, including a 'prohibition on all in-stadia advertising and logos on players’ uniforms';

(3)	recognises that governments have a clear public health responsibility to avoid promoting activities known to cause harm — just as occurred when tobacco advertising and sponsorship were banned to protect community wellbeing;

(4)	affirms that publicly owned venues should model this standard by prohibiting gambling advertising and sponsorship that normalise or glamorise wagering;

(5)	calls on the Government to:

introduce, within one year of this resolution, a complete ban on gambling advertising and sponsorship at all state-owned or state-funded venues, including the proposed Macquarie Point Stadium, and on players’ uniforms; and

table a progress report within six months of this resolution on the implementation of the removal of gambling advertising from existing venues.

I rise to speak on motion 8 standing in my name relating to gambling advertising at state-owned and state-funded venues. We are a nation of sport lovers here in Australia. In fact, it can appear a bit like an obsession sometimes to those from other countries just how rabidly we are into sport. Barely any of us would blink when we hear observations that sport is part of the national psyche or that it informs our sense of identity.

We are proud that we punch above our weight on the international stage, such as at the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games, and particular codes such as cricket or rugby, and even as a state, Tasmania shares in this cultural tradition just as much as the rest of the nation and proudly we love our sport. At a community level, it's recognised that participating in or supporting local sports can foster a sense of belonging, improve fitness connectivity and provide mental health benefits.

We have a high sports participation rate as well as a strong supporter ethos and dedicated fan culture around sport. However, just as our nation is recognised globally as 'sports mad', Australia also records another, more dubious global reputation. Australians lose $32 billion on legal forms of gambling each year, the highest per-capita gambling losses in the world.

According to the Grattan Institute's 2024 report, A Better Bet - How Australia Should Prevent Gambling Harm, the nation's average losses per adult equate to a whopping $1635, which far exceeds the average in similar countries such as the US, which comes in at an average annual loss of $809, and New Zealand at $584 - significantly lower amounts.

An Equity Economics research report of earlier this year notes that since around one third of Australian adults do not gamble, the average gambling loss per gambler increases to $2942 per year. Further, Equity Economics estimates that frequent gamblers lose, on average, approximately $35,000 a year. This equates to almost two-thirds of an annual minimum wage and it's worth noting that evidence is of frequent gamblers in that example.

That's not even those who would be recognised under certain metrics as problem gamblers necessarily. Sadly, Tasmania also shares that trend with our interstate counterparts. We know that annually, here, just in the last financial year, Tasmanians, for example, lost a shocking total of over $190 million on poker machines alone.

We love our sports. Research tells us that policymakers know that, as do a range of community and physical and mental health advocates organisations, we all know that, but who else has noticed those national trends and state trends? Gambling and betting companies have. They've noticed how much we love our sport, that's for sure, because we see a barrage of gambling advertising spurring these trends, normalising gambling, inducing more spending and triggering betting urges for people who are at risk.

According to the Grattan Institute, in 2022-23 there were more than 1 million gambling ads aired on free-to-air TV and metropolitan radio, for example. Additionally, online gambling companies are responsible for 64 per cent of total gambling advertising spending. Companies do not sink that degree of capital into advertising if they did not think it would reap them a substantial financial reward. The gambling and betting companies, along with the advertising and promotional consultancies, utilise targeted strategies to ensure lucrative returns.

The Australian Gambling Research Centre (the AGRC), based within the Australian government's Australian Institute of Family Studies, has found that the growth in sports and race betting has happened alongside rapid increases in expenditure on wagering advertising in Australia. Recent estimates suggest that the gambling industry spent $287.2 million on advertising nationally in 2021, an increase of $15.9 million from 2020.

As the Grattan Institute researchers state:

Gambling advertising is particularly prominent around sport. As well as direct broadcast advertising, betting companies sponsor stadiums and teams, meaning their logos are visible throughout the game. Most major sporting codes have partnerships with online betting companies and receive a cut of the money bet on their games, so they have financial incentives to promote gambling among fans. Official apps display the odds for every game alongside the score. Betting companies also use online advertising, direct marketing and inducements to entice gamblers, including those who are vulnerable to gambling harm or, from the company's perspective, lucrative VIPs.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=15.6_D=0.7_C=0.64]  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=17.4_D=23.6_C=0.83] Our sports grounds have become gambling, hunting grounds. There was nothing accidental about that and people are beginning to become very concerned. 

In 2023, an AGRC study revealed that the community is finding that betting advertising is making sport less enjoyable and less family-friendly. Specifically, the report states, 

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=41.6_D=19.8_C=0.86] Australia's renowned love of sport is being negatively impacted by the proliferation of betting advertising. Betting advertising is eroding Australia's love of sport, which has been part of our national identity for many years. We're now seeing a significant level of concern about the relationship between gambling companies, Australian sporting teams and sports coverage.'

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=62.3_D=4.9_C=0.84] It is worth looking at that report statistics in detail. It tells us  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=68.0_D=5.9_C=0.77] 69 per cent of Australian adults believe that sport and race betting advertising is too common and with 60 per cent thinking that it makes sport less family-friendly.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=74.8_D=3.9_C=0.73]  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=79.3_D=25.6_C=0.83] Almost half, 46 per cent, of respondents reporting that wagering advertising is decreasing their enjoyment of sport. More than half of Australians, 52 per cent in fact, believe that betting advertising and I quote:

Normalises gambling among children.

With 69 per cent concerned that it makes betting seem like a normal part of sport. The report also found a link between exposure to wagering advertising and riskier betting behaviour.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=105.8_D=14.0_C=0.87] Young people aged 18 to 34 years are significantly impacted as one-in-five young women, 19 per cent and one in seven young men, 15 per cent, started betting for the first time after seeing or hearing an ad on TV.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=120.8_D=11.7_C=0.87] Among individuals who were at risk of gambling harm, 41 per cent reported trying a new form of betting and 40 per cent bet on impulse as a result of seeing or hearing wagering advertising.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=133.2_D=14.7_C=0.81] These are very alarming statistics. It is no wonder then that the AGRC study also found respondents demonstrated strong support for government-led action to address the issue, with two-in-five participants  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=148.3_D=16.7_C=0.79] backing outright bans on sponsorship of sporting teams and clubs and sponsorship of sports coverage by betting companies. 

These concerning statistics are also borne out by other research and studies, however I will not go into them in in detail now because of time, but it is well established that people have had enough of these invasive  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=165.5_D=15.0_C=0.86] and predatory gambling advertising practices. Many members here will be well aware of the Federal Parliament's House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs Report,  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=180.8_D=12.2_C=0.77] You Win Some, You Lose More - Online Gambling and its Impacts on Those Experiencing Gambling Harm. This important report is also referred to as the Murphy report after its chair, the late Peta Murphy MP.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=194.1_D=14.8_C=0.85] This federally led thorough examination of online gambling is broader than the motion here before us today. However, it is worth noting that it did examine as part of its brief, the impact of gambling advertising, including its impact upon sports and our sporting culture.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=209.6_D=29.4_C=0.81] Significantly, the Murphy Report warns, 

Gambling advertising is grooming children and young people to gamble and encourages riskier behaviour.

I wonder then that the Murphy report recommended ending the barrage of gambling advertising with a total ban. The report's recommendation number 26 states, 

Prohibition of all online gambling advertising and commentary on odds during and an hour either side of a sports broadcast.  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=239.4_D=5.6_C=0.74] Prohibition on all in-stadia advertising, including logos on players uniforms.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=245.8_D=16.8_C=0.82] Unfortunately, despite the federal Albanese government accepting all 31 of the Murphy report's recommendations, implementation has yet to occur. We may not have to be here now debating this motion if implementation of those important recommendations were underway, but there is just no sign of it.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=263.7_D=29.9_C=0.83] Which brings us to the crux of the matter before us. This is not just a mere story of statistics, nor is it just that people are noticing the growing escalation in and barrage of gambling advertising hitting our airwaves and a range of devices, or that researchers are busy researching what we think or feel about that. The specific and key concern here that this motion calls on us now to face is the growing recognition and the deep concern about the normalisation of gambling  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=293.7_D=11.3_C=0.74] in sport, our national pastime, our obsession that is intrinsically linked with positive aspects of our national psyche - sport, the social activity that hones athletic powers, provides inter- and intra-community connection, and which can be a unifying force across generations, creeds, genders and cultures. As I touched on briefly, the 2023 AGRC report found that more than half of the surveyed respondents believe that betting advertising normalises gambling among children and 69 per cent were concerned it makes betting seem like a normal part of sport.

As highlighted by research including by the Grattan Institute, gambling and betting company spend a considerable amount of time marketing to sports fans. Their presence is highly visible throughout broadcast and online ads; a format outside the scope of the current motion before us, because it's outside the scope of the state government. However, other delivery mechanisms include team and stadium sponsorships and deals with sporting codes. It is this promotional delivery mechanism which is also so insidious. It's so insidiously normalising.

Betting logos and stadium promotions around the game, and on favourite teams' uniforms, not only become a visual constant; they also implicitly imply an endorsement of the promoted activity. As it is designed to do, this blurs the line between a group, communal and even family-friendly activities such as sport, and a recognised, potentially problematic activity such as gambling. The lines between sport and gambling become blurred when a slogan or logo is recognised both on and off the pitch.

As many have observed, this blurring of the lines extrapolating from a social sport environment makes gambling and betting appear as a natural and intrinsic aspect of the fan and team supporter experience. Significantly, it is not only the research telling us that exposure to such gambling advertising, particularly during sports coverage or sports games, is leading to riskier betting behaviour and escalating the likelihood of experiencing gambling harm, as summarised by that 2023 AGRC report; it's also community members, parents, young people and athletes who are calling for time out.

It is interesting to note the AGRC research highlights community concerns regarding the impact of gambling advertising and promotions online and at live games. An example of that negative impact - which I hear a lot about - is the risk of triggering harmful behaviour; particularly amongst those battling either a gambling problem, or who are concerned they are on their way to developing a serious gambling problem. For those people, including many Tasmanians, sitting through a match to watch their favourite team becomes an endurance test; a battle of wills between themselves and the triggering of the gambling advertising pummelling them during every ad break, commentator spiel or watching their favourite player run past in their logo-adorned uniform.

Some cannot withstand that onslaught and succumb to those harmful messages. Others may resist by choosing to turn off the match or decide not to go to support their team live to avoid being exposed to it. Ironically, gambling self-exclusion can prevent team supporters paying their ticket at the gate and supporting their team at live matches. It's a shame for them as a fan. It's a shame and a commercial shame also for that local venue and team. More importantly, it can damage family ties, if that act of self-exclusion also prevents children and young people being able to attend the live match due to the adult's responsible decision. We may recognise that hard choice as being responsible but try explaining that to your enthusiastic 10- or 14-year-old whose mates will also be at the game, but they can't be.

It's also important to mention here last year's federal government's rapid review of prevention approaches to gender-based violence. This report, released in August last year, calls for the prioritisation of further work to review and strengthen alcohol and gambling regulatory environments to prioritise the prevention of gender-based violence. It also recommends, as recommendation 17, stronger restrictions leading to a total ban on advertising of gambling.

These calls for action, whether from community research, such as that undertaken by the AGRC, or parliamentary and government inquiries, including the Murphy report of 2023 and more recently the federal rapid review of preventative approaches to gender-based violence, reflect the actual reported harm occurring; not just that perceived, but actual harm.

Another particular driving factor is the recognised harm that blurring the lines and the normalisation of gambling with sporting activity is having on our young people and children. It is important to invest a little more time in examining what the evidence is telling us regarding the ramifications that the normalisation of gambling is having on our children and young people. I mentioned earlier the warning contained in the Murphy report that, I quote, [tbc 3.45]

Gambling advertising is grooming children and young people to gamble and encourages riskier behaviour.
It's a strong statement, nothing equivocal in it, but how is that grooming occurring? As I touched on earlier, it is the targeted and predatory combination of placement evoking subliminal and implied endorsement. It's in the information I circulated prior to this debate to members. I drew attention to a 2024 Deakin University paper published in the Research in the Sociology of Sport Journal, volume 18. The paper is called The impact of marketing on the normalisation of gambling in sport for children and young people.

I wish to highlight some of its key points as it's pertinent to the intent of this motion. In discussing the influence of marketing on the normalisation of gambling for young people, it examines a range of socio-cultural influences and observational learning trends amongst children and young people. These trends can be informed by seeing what family and parents are doing as well as influenced by peer group activities. Observational learning in this context is highly predicated upon awareness. Researchers have identified that young people have significant unprompted recall of sports betting brands, with multiple studies finding that over 75 per cent of young people can name at least one betting brand.

Further, researchers have demonstrated that young people can retell the plotline of sports betting advertisements, with some children being able to recite verbatim the taglines and slogans used. Children could name and or describe the celebrity who was used in a specific betting company campaign. The study states this, I quote, [tbc 3.36]

Importantly, young people also recall seeing marketing for sports betting embedded in community settings, including on billboards and public transport. However, it is young people's awareness of the different types of marketing that appear during sporting matches that demonstrate the omnipresent nature of marketing for these products aligned with sport. This includes gambling marketing at the stadium, around the grounds, on player jerseys, on the scoreboard and during announcements by commentators.

This journal article makes for compulsive, if not disturbing reading. However, I'd limit myself to highlighting a further two very pertinent points it makes within the context of this debate. The first is what the research tells on the influence gambling marketing on young people's perceptions. For example, the study reports that marketing makes gambling appear fun and exciting. It also influences the way young people perceive how they would engage with gambling with reports that they believe that gambling appears easy and is highly accessible.

Disturbingly, the report reinforces how the alignment of gambling with sport also influences how children and young people conceptualise engaging with gambling. For example, young people believe that gambling on sport would make people more invested in the game and more committed or loyal sports fans.

It highlights the negative impact of celebrity endorsements that we see in advertising and on grounds. For example, young people have reported that when they see sports stars endorsing gambling, it increases perceptions of trust associated with the gambling brand.

The journal article states, and I quote, [tbc 3.48]

Young people have reported, that when current athletes have the brand of a gambling company on their jersey, they are legitimising the company. They also perceive that if the athlete is happy to wear the brand, then they must support the company.

Worryingly the study also found, (tbc 3.49]

Young people have been curious to try gambling, particularly if they are sports fans. In our most recent study, we found that a fifth of young people said they would bet on a sport when they were older.

The problem is pretty clear. We have evidence based and peer reviewed report after report. We have parliamentary and government inquiries corroborating that evidence and making very similar recommendations. However, it's important to note that when making those recommendations, empirical research and parliamentary inquiries are doing so by applying a public health policy lens and this is a very important factor to this debate.

Addressing potential and actual gambling harm must be approached as a public health issue. Taking a public health policy approach is consistent with the Tasmanian Government's Gambling Support Program Strategic Framework 2019 to 2023. Despite being a little out of date now, this framework includes the following statement by the former Minister for Human Services at the time, Roger Jaensch MP said this. [tbc 3.50]

The Tasmanian Government takes a public health approach to reducing gambling harm that not only considers harms for individual gamblers, but also their families and communities.

That is as it should be, and the motion before us is consistent with that established state government public health imperative policy. A fundamental tenet of modern public health policy is that prevention is better than cure. We need to apply that tenet if we're going to successfully disrupt the social norm that betting and sport go together.

As public health policy-makers, parliaments have precedent in taking a prevention-over-cure regulatory approach on a wide range of matters. The most obvious and comparable example being that of banning tobacco product advertising and sponsorship. At the risk of offending any members, and I am sure there are many of us who can recall the dim dark smoke obscure days when we sat down to enjoy a Benson & Hedges cricket test match, for example, when the ground fences would be clad in tobacco product advertising.

Ms Forrest - Some members are too young for that.

Mr Hiscutt - Yes, sorry.

Ms WEBB - There you go, lucky you. The turf - where the ground fences would be clad in tobacco product advertising - the turf and uniforms would bear tobacco company logos and commentators would roll company names into score updates without drawing ventilator-assisted breath. In correlation, millions of taxpayers' dollars were being were being spent in trying to save lives from lung cancer and other tobacco-linked illnesses, preventing young people from taking up smoking and anti-smoking awareness campaigns.

People could no longer smoke in their workplace and other public venues, but they were constantly under siege of advertising telling them that they wanted to-they needed to-light up. Government's first banned tobacco broadcast advertising in 1976, but it took until 1996 to ban tobacco product sponsorships altogether. The parallels and the harmful tells are all there, between the tobacco advertising and sponsorship of yesteryear and the current gambling onslaught. We have replaced one highly addictive, harmful and predatory product with another.

Some would also include the prevalence of alcohol advertising in these venues, too, which I acknowledge, however, it's outside the scope of this particular debate and the intent of this particular motion before us. There are many comparisons and detailed analyses between tobacco product and gambling advertising and sponsorship that we could go into, but the key point, for the purposes of this debate now, is that we have the evidence that tobacco advertising bans - that model worked.

As stated by the Deakin University study into gambling advertising impacts on children and young people, 

As has been shown in tobacco control, the only robust way to significantly reduce young people's exposure to gambling advertising is through comprehensive government regulation, including comprehensive curbs on advertising, promotions and sponsorship across a range of media platforms and community environments.

I brace myself for the inevitable buck passing of, 'Oh, this is a federal government problem. The states cannot do it on their own.' While I agree that states cannot implement the Murphy report recommendation of a blanket ban on gambling advertising in isolation on their own, I will push back on the excuse that we do not have any responsibility to act to implement good public preventative health policy where we can. We do have the power to declare our state-owned and -funded venues gambling ad free zones. The state can do that. We have a responsibility to do that. Let's be clear, failure to implement such a public preventative health policy is a deliberate choice to not do so.

This motion before us, specifically clauses 3 and 4, emphasise both the state government's responsibility to act and the national leadership such action would demonstrate on this important public health policy issue. Other states, including some sports codes, are also exploring ways to create gambling-ad-free zones for their communities. For example, Victoria had banned gambling advertising from its public transport assets, partially in recognition that many young people and children are reliant on public transport just going about their daily school and recreational lives.

In February this year, New South Wales announced it will also remove gambling advertising from its public transport network. Additionally, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria also have state government-supported, code-based voluntary programs to go gambling-advertising-and-sponsorship free, a club-based self-exclusion strategy you could say. A commentary theme across these three state-based programs is the calling cry in their respective names to put the game, to put sport, first.

'Love the game' calls Victoria. 'Here for the game,' reminds South Australia, and 'Reclaim the game,' exhorts New South Wales. These programs work by local and state-based clubs declaring to go gambling-advertising-and-sponsorship free. The largest scheme in New South Wales includes clubs from six codes, the AFL, the A League, Cricket, NBL, Netball and NRL. These include the AFL Sydney Swans, Cricket Sydney Thunder and Sydney's Sydney Sixers, Giants Net Ballers and South Sydney Rabbitohs.

Tom Harley, CEO of the Sydney Swans, states on the website that the club is working in partnership with the New South Wales Government's Reclaim the Game initiative to raise awareness of the risks associated with gambling. He says:

This partnership supports our ambition to provide a more family-friendly sporting experience at our home matches for both our men's and women's teams.

There are many other insightful contributions from players across the codes on the New South Wales Reclaim the Game website, and if members have not yet had the opportunity to do so, I encourage you to check it out. A telling insight provided on New South Wales Reclaim the Game web page is the following:

Sports betting advertising and sponsorship is everywhere. You see it in most sports. It has gotten to the point where we don't know sport without it and young people are exposed to too much betting advertising. As a result, many young people think betting is a normal part of watching sport. Almost 50 per cent of 12- to 17-year-olds see gambling advertising on TV during sports and racing on a weekly basis.

There's nothing sporting or impressive about those stats, but some in New South Wales are trying to do something about them and to turn the stats around. However, the other commonality shared by these states, those three states is that unfortunately programs are voluntary only. It's up to individual clubs to take on all of the responsibility which should I think be shared by the state governments and the public health policy-makers and regulators.

Therefore, despite that fundamental limitation, suffice to say these few interstate examples I have highlighted demonstrate that not only are the concerns identified in the motion before us real, they are recognised elsewhere and they are being acted upon elsewhere by others who take responsibility to act where they can. So why not here too?

One last consideration that warrants being addressed briefly, is the concern of loss of revenue for venues or clubs which forego gambling, advertising or sponsorship. The evidence tells us, that not only can venues and clubs survive, they can thrive without this source of income. Again, the previous tobacco product ban model provides relevant examples here.

As highlighted by the Grattan Institute on page 42 of its A Better Bet report, when the tobacco product advertising and sponsorship bans were finally implemented, other sponsors, including state government public health agencies quickly jumped into the openings.

Rugby league's Winfield Cup became the Optus Cup, Ansett and Carlton and United Breweries took over the Benson & Hedges Cup series. Significantly, the total value of sports sponsorships grew by an average of 11 per cent per year in the three years after the ban was implemented in 1996. Just to repeat that, sponsorships grew by an average of 11 per cent per year in the three years after the ban.

The evidence also indicates that the removal of an aggressive large corporate advertising sector, such as tobacco or gambling, actually assists in opening up and providing a more level sporting sponsorship field. Former AFL CEO boss, Gillan McLaughlin, has acknowledged that at least part of lost gambling sponsorship revenue would be replaced by making it more accessible for other participants.

The Grattan report also cites as Sports Bet's chief commercial officer, now CEO, Barney Evans, who said that when the company started sponsoring the AFL in 2017:

It's absolutely a premium media asset; it gets right to the heart of footy in the southern states and therefore it's absolutely appropriate asset to go for and as a consequence is heavily sought after.

Just like big tobacco, big gambling can outprice other players, but like that historic example, once the gap is created in the market, others can then fill it in a more sustainable manner. It may allow a broader range of potential advertisers who are not out-competed in a blanket manner.

Yes, it may be at a lower funding rate, but there is a greater scope. There can be more advertisers and sponsors, potentially ensuring the funding numbers balance. For example, the South Sydney Rabbitohs were previously sponsored by Luxbet and Sports Bet, but since the club joined the New South Wales Reclaim the Game program in 2022, the club's sponsorship revenue grew from $8.9 million in 2021 to $11 million in 2023. Levelling the sponsorship playing field may well be an important investment for the state to take.

The final point I wish to make is in relation to clause 5 of the motion before us. While it should be self-explanatory, I do wish to place on the record that nobody is suggesting turning off the tap overnight. The affected Tasmanian venues and any teams with current gambling sponsorship would have at least 12 months to make adjustments under this motion's proposed time frame.

MOTION

Gambling Advertising at State-Owned and State-Funded Venues

Resumed from above (page xx)

Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, I was saying the affected Tasmanian venues and any teams with current gambling sponsorships would have at least 12 months to make adjustments under this motion's proposed time frame. The motion also provides for a six-month update report to be provided by which we can evaluate implementation progress.

For many state-owned venues and teams, it may not be an issue, in which case this motion will will ensure there are clear and consistent public health policy guidelines which need to be applied when any future advertising and sponsorship arrangements are being considered.

To conclude, I reiterate my earlier statement that prevention is better than cure. Again, we need to apply that principle rigorously if we're going to successfully disrupt the social norm that betting and sport go together. Ongoing and contemporary research reveals the degree to which gambling and betting companies are exploiting our love of sports to their lucrative benefit. There's a growing recognition and concern that our young people and children are also being actively targeted by these companies, with potentially dire future impacts on gambling rates and addiction.

We have heard a lot in recent times of the community sporting aspirations and that of our young people in particular. As part of those aspirations, I know there are parents or older siblings wishing and hoping they can attend a local game or event with their children or younger siblings without feeling they're risking potential gambling harm from being triggered. Many will just aspire to being able to drop their self-mandated self-exclusion from attending Tasmanian Government-owned or funded venues and events because they cannot afford to take that risk.

I share the aspiration and wishes of many that they could watch their favourite player and cheer on from the sidelines, their child, siblings, friends on the field without having to turn a blind eye to the gambling advertising stitched across the team uniform or around the grounds. Imagine fulfilling the aspirations of parents wanting to turn off the online devices at home to have a break from all the betting updates pervasively punctuating a games broadcast by taking the family to watch it live instead. Securing the knowledge they will be sharing that experience in a gambling ad and sponsorship free zone.

Imagine delivering on the public health policy mandate, an aspiration to prevent future gambling harm, either for current gamblers and their families tackling the disease now or for future generations. Tasmania could become a national leader in this regard. We could throw down the gauntlet to the federal government and say, come on, catch up with us. Implement the Murphy report recommendations as you said you would, and we'll be happy to share our evidence-based expertise derived from our state venue gambling ad free zone policy to give you a hand. Wouldn't that be something to aspire to?

Public spaces funded by the public dollar, which seek to protect the public interest by deliberately disrupting the norm that betting and sport go together. Let's give gambling and betting ads the boot and declare state owned and funded venues gambling, advertising and sponsorship free zones. I commend the motion to the House.

[4.34 p.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - Mr President, I rise in full support of the member for Nelson's motion and her call for the government to implement a complete ban on gambling advertising and sponsorship at every venue that's state owned or has state funding. I also fully support a ban on gambling advertising on players uniforms in every level of sport in Tasmania.

We've heard all too often of the harm that gambling addiction brings to every level of society, and in particular partners and family members of gambling addicts. Yet we're still waiting for meaningful action from the government to at least try to make a difference. Adverts for gambling helplines are all well and good, but by then the damage has often been done. The evidence is clear: gambling is causing immeasurable harm in Tasmania and government venues, and funding must not be used to normalise or promote the risk or that harm.

The losses for Tasmanians playing poker machines are at alarmingly high levels. The recent Treasury figures and reporting showing the state is on track for an annual loss of more than $190 million with monthly totals reaching record levels, and half of those losses come from people experiencing addiction.

These are not abstract statistics. They represent families pushed into debt; relationship strained and lives upended. We cannot in good conscience allow publicly owned property to be a billboard for an activity that causes so much harm in our community. It is especially so in a cost-of-living crisis that can lead to even higher levels of gambling, as its addicts attempt to beat the odds and a futile effort to redeem their losses.

The 2023 inquiry report into online gambling - 'You win some, you lose more' - recommended a comprehensive ban on online gambling advertising within three years. That we are still waiting for. The recommendation explicitly calling for a prohibition on in-stadia advertising and logos on players uniforms is another crucial step. That recommendation recognises what public health experts have long argued: that advertising drives uptakes, normalises risk behaviour and undermines prevention efforts. If the Commonwealth can recommend this, our state should lead by example and adopt the same standard for venues we own or fund.

There is growing evidence that exposure to gambling advertising is grooming children and young people to view betting as an ordinary part of sport and leisure. Research and advocacy groups have documented how saturation advertising and simulated gambling in games are shaping attitudes and behaviours among young people, increasing the risk they will start gambling earlier and more frequently.

We have a duty to protect young Tasmanians from commercial messages that prime them for addiction. We might hold out hope that the coming social media ban from under-16s that comes into effect next week can make a difference, but it does nothing to stop under-16s being exposed to gambling adverts through TV, online or in sports grounds. With a third of high school students reporting that they have gambled, we need to act, and act quickly.

History offers us a clear precedent. When tobacco advertising and sponsorship were banned, government acted to protect public health and shifted social norms away from a harmful product. Our recent vaping reforms show that we can act decisively without hesitation when there's a proven risk of harm. We should apply the same public health principle to gambling advertising at all public venues. If an activity causes demonstrable harm, the state must not promote it. Publicly owned stadiums, arenas and community facilities should model the standard we expect of private operators. Places funded by taxpayers must not be used to normalise or glamourise wagering.

I fully support the motions' practical measures that simply reflect the recommendation from a respected report that's now three years old. I must ask, why has it taken so long? What has stopped the government from making it happen? The government has been loudly championing the opportunity for young Tasmanians to aspire for the JackJumpers, and it should be loudly supporting this motion to introduce a complete ban on gambling, advertising and sponsorship at all state-owned and state-funded venues, including the proposed Macquarie Point Stadium and players uniforms.

This is not an attack on sport or on businesses that rely on sponsorship, it is a decision about the role of government and the messages we are sending from public spaces. We can protect vulnerable Tasmanians. We can reduce the grooming of children into gambling and align our state with national recommendations while supporting teams and events to find ethical, community-minded partners. I commend the motion to the Council, and I thank the member for bringing it on.

Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - Mr President. I'm very pleased to indicate I will be supporting this motion, and I hope other members of the Council do also. In many ways, it's just common sense backed by evidence, where a society that understands cigarettes are lethal and highly addictive and we banned cigarette advertising from televisions in this country more than 30 years ago. Gambling products can be  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.8_D=3.8_C=0.90] extremely addictive, and they can be lethal. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.2_D=25.4_C=0.85]  We have got the most addictive electronic gaming machines anywhere in the world, here in Australia and in Tasmania. All of us have met or represented people who have lost everything because of their addiction to poker machines and we have had to endure  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=56.4_D=3.4_C=0.90] government ministers and members over a long period of time  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=60.3_D=29.9_C=0.81] saying this is a matter of personal responsibility. It is such a shameful cop-out of a response, when we know that gambling advertisers, the whole corporate gambling sector, multi-tendrilled as it is, targets people who are vulnerable; it targets them when they are at their most vulnerable; targets children through the normalisation of gambling through promotions and  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=90.4_D=28.1_C=0.84] advertising in places that children and young people go to.

There is research. It is 2012 research, undertaken by Monash University. The title of it is Sports Betting Marketing During Sporting Events - A Stadium and Broadcast Census of Australian Football League Matches. This paper was written before some of those extraordinary  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=119.3_D=1.5_C=0.79] leaps in technology that we have seen - technology which is now routinely [Bookmark: Phr8_O=121.2_D=4.1_C=0.75]  put in places like stadia to accelerate the extraction of people from their income. This research by Samantha Thomas, Sophie Lewis, Jenny Duong and Colin McLeod f [Bookmark: Phr10_O=144.6_D=8.6_C=0.77] ound in 2012 - researchers also suggested up to 80 per cent of adolescents will have engaged in gambling by the time they are 18, with up to  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=153.6_D=14.3_C=0.86] 8 per cent categorised as problem gamblers and up to 15 per cent at risk of developing problem gambling behaviours. We have to be very careful, of course, when we use a term like 'problem' gambler, because again  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=168.2_D=19.3_C=0.83] that kind of places a level of individual responsibility on that person, which is completely unfair. It is gambling addiction, and the paper says:

Researchers have also clearly shown that patterns of risky and problem gambling have significant broader impacts on the well-being of families and communities.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=189.2_D=7.6_C=0.82] It goes on to say that current gambling prevention models focus on individuals taking:

Personal responsibility for their gambling behaviours.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=197.8_D=29.4_C=0.87] This includes individuals knowing their limits and recognising and accessing help services if they feel they have a problem. However, as has been recognised in other public health issues an emphasis on personal responsibility may potentially hamper the introduction of socially responsible initiatives that take into account the broader welfare of the community.

The paper notes that sports betting is a rapidly growing segment of the gambling market. Alongside this has been an increase in the amount of marketing for sports betting  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=227.3_D=0.9_C=0.62] products. That paper [Bookmark: Phr16_O=228.9_D=3.6_C=0.80]  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=234.1_D=3.4_C=0.92] , towards the end, in its discussion and implications  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=239.8_D=25.6_C=0.87] section says:

A diverse range of marketing platforms were used to market sports betting products and services.

This is over a period of time when they assessed gambling product advertisement at AFL matches:

Which reflects the coming together of commercial relationships between a variety of different agencies. 

The use of these multiple platforms such as static and dynamic signage,  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=265.9_D=29.8_C=0.80] school board advertising, logos, shirts, sponsorships, animated sponsored goal replays, et cetera, particularly at stadiums, meant that there was rarely a time during the match when audiences were not exposed to some form of marketing for sports betting. 

This finding raises an important point about the impact of saturation marketing strategies in which audiences, in this case individuals who attend sporting matches or watch sports on television, are unable to avoid some types  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=295.9_D=9.1_C=0.80] of marketing. As observed in other public health issues such as tobacco, marketing strategies based on saturation techniques are particularly problematic because of the ways in which individuals can never avoid seeing or receiving messages. Furthermore, marketing for sports betting, particularly on dynamic signage, was inherently transferred to different spaces, such as family homes, through television broadcasts. 

As shown in other areas such as tobacco, these types of marketing may be particularly influential in softening children to products.

There's another quite worrying short paper that's been produced by one of the big four consultancies, Deloitte. This is this paper reads to me like a direct pitch to the gambling industry, sports betting industries, but also to sports clubs because it promotes the use of all-pervasive technologies within facilities like stadia in order to extract maximum data from patrons, persuade patrons in their choices of where they spend that money in the venue, and then there's a data record and tracking that follows through for that patron.

This paper, which is called the Stadium As A Platform - A New Model For Integrating Venue Technology Into Sports Businesses, says:

Increases in computing power and the shift to mobile and cloud computing as a dominant paradigm have fundamentally reshaped commerce. Today's smartphone owner carries a device with processing power that would have required a computer the size of a stadium 50 years ago.

These trends are increasingly converging with bits and atoms coming together. The sports industry is moving towards a new model in which the stadium is a technological and commercial platform. This change subverts the traditional way of thinking about the stadium experience. It's no longer enough to only consider the role of sight lines, seat width and the price of beer.

Teams need to engage their fans and event-goers to encourage them to shape their own experience. While the platform concept requires an organisational and operational mind shift for teams and stadium operators, teams that embrace it in stadium design, construction and operation will be on the vanguard of offering their fans the best experience in the stadiums of the future.

It describes the modern stadium as a:

… technological marvel, with thousands of access points and hundreds of miles of networking cable installed in a large and complex building footprint. 

It details that there are Wi-Fi access points and distributed antenna, networked hardware and beacon technology to enable location-based service to fans and stadium operations staff. It talks about 'connected immersive display hardware' that can turn all parts of the arena into interactive screens.

It details venue-wide enterprise resource planning systems to integrate in-stadium functions like operations, facilities, retail point-of-sale, customer service, ticketing and social media. It details elements like data ingestion, processing, output and visualisation systems that can integrate stadium and game data, package it into fan-friendly formats and display across a range of devices.

It also talks about systems integration solutions that enable stadium technology to integrate with its surrounding environment, including broadcast systems, nearby retail, dining and municipal transit systems. The last pitch at the end is the one that certainly gave me chills. The conclusion from Deloitte is,

Reimagining the modern stadium as a technology and business platform has significant implications for the sports and entertainment industry. Stadiums are more connected than ever before, and so are the fans that work walk through the turnstile. This hyperconnectivity can be the foundation for creating new transactions, growing new businesses, and unlocking new revenue streams.

Adopting a platform mentality when it comes to technology means designing a stadium's infrastructure to allow fans and partners to create new applications using data generated through stadium systems. Adopting a platform mentality in business means thinking about how value can be created through new experiences in the stadium whether directly from the team or from others, and capturing that value in a commercially beneficial way for the team.

Again, this is about extracting money from people who attend sporting events and using multi-layered [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.4_D=2.2_C=0.95]  technologies in order to [Bookmark: Phr3_O=29.9_D=18.4_C=0.86]  influence the way people move, think, eat, travel. It's pervasive and the effect of it is likely to be pernicious if it is not heavily regulated. We can't allow [Bookmark: Phr4_O=49.0_D=15.4_C=0.88]  a gambling advertising free-for-all in this country, and, as this motion suggests we call on the government to do, we can't allow gambling advertising [Bookmark: Phr5_O=64.7_D=25.7_C=0.87]  in public venues, like any one of our existing stadia, which kids go along to - up at York Park, for example - watch the footy and are exposed to gambling advertising. 

We can do better as a society because as a society we know here in Tasmania - certainly everyone in this place should know [Bookmark: Phr6_O=91.1_D=3.4_C=0.89]  - that we have allowed electronic gaming machines [Bookmark: Phr7_O=94.9_D=25.8_C=0.83]  and the companies that promote and profit from them to write the rules. We had the expiry of the gaming deed that was a real opportunity to save people's lives and livelihoods, and we watched this government roll over to the gambling industry. Then there was a promise [Bookmark: Phr8_O=121.5_D=3.4_C=0.85]  that they would deliver genuine harm minimisation that included, for example [Bookmark: Phr9_O=125.3_D=9.1_C=0.78] , mandatory precommitment cards. The government has now walked away from that. 

The industry said, how about a little bit of facial recognition [Bookmark: Phr10_O=134.9_D=25.2_C=0.83]  and the government said, yeah, sounds good. Well, we haven't heard much more about that yet either. That said, there is no evidence that that technology will prevent people from losing heavily at any one of our now many pokies venues around the state, but great news: the Treasurer and minister [Bookmark: Phr11_O=161.0_D=4.7_C=0.73]  responsible, minister Abetz, said in our Legislative Council [Bookmark: Phr12_O=166.1_D=4.8_C=0.90]  Estimates last week that the  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=171.7_D=10.3_C=0.79] state will introduce gaming care officers. 

The industry has come to government with a proposal [Bookmark: Phr14_O=183.0_D=9.4_C=0.86]  to have gaming care officers in venues around the state, but as I understand it, there will only be four of them [Bookmark: Phr15_O=193.4_D=5.9_C=0.77]  at the many venues which now have EGMs, and [Bookmark: Phr16_O=200.3_D=4.1_C=0.93]  so what is this about, and where is the evidence for [Bookmark: Phr17_O=206.1_D=23.9_C=0.85]  this brain burp of an idea? Well, it's the industry again calling the shots and that is why, at a bare minimum, we should be insisting that there's no advertising of gambling products in publicly owned venues [Bookmark: Phr18_O=230.7_D=10.2_C=0.81]  in Tasmania. The closing to the honourable member for Nelson's motion is that:

		the government [Bookmark: Phr19_O=242.3_D=25.4_C=0.80]  is called on to introduce, within one year of this resolution, a complete ban on gambling advertising and sponsorship at all state-owned or state-funded venues, including the proposed Macquarie Point stadium, and on players uniforms; and 

		table a progress report, within six months of this resolution, on the implementation of the removal of gambling advertising from existing venues.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=268.5_D=3.1_C=0.91] This is not a radical motion. This is not a motion [Bookmark: Phr21_O=272.5_D=12.1_C=0.91]  that members should be uncomfortable with. In some ways, in terms of mitigating the harm caused by gambling advertising, it's the bare minimum [Bookmark: Phr22_O=285.5_D=5.7_C=0.90]  and it's something over which government has control [Bookmark: Phr23_O=291.9_D=1.9_C=0.81] . If the government [Bookmark: Phr24_O=294.4_D=10.6_C=0.88]  were serious about making sure children and young people are not exposed to gambling products at a young age, and certainly not saturated with them, which is where we're at now, then it would be doing this anyway. I'm very thankful to the member for Nelson for putting this motion forward. I hope it is successful, because if we did that, it would make a real difference.

[4.55 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) Mr President, thank you, and I want to thank the member for Nelson for bringing forward this motion and for her consistent interest and advocacy in matters relating to gambling harm. I'd also like to acknowledge other members in this place who certainly support the member in their advocacy.

First, let me state clearly the government recognises gambling harm as a serious public health and social issue. The government understands that problem gambling can have devastating impacts on individuals, families and communities. The motion refers to the influence of gambling advertising and its potential role in normalising gambling behaviour, particularly among young people. While these concerns are valid and deserve attention, it is important to note that the regulation of online gambling and associated advertising falls primarily under the jurisdiction of the Australian Government through the Interactive Gambling Act 2001.

In the government's view, gambling harm minimisation is a complex challenge that requires a multifaceted approach, and not solely on advertising restrictions. Any measures of this scale should be considered within a broader national framework to ensure consistency and effectiveness. The motion references the House of Representatives Standing Committee 2023 report, 'You win some, you lose more', which made several recommendations, including Recommendation 26 calling for a comprehensive ban on gambling advertising.

While this report is significant, it is a fact the Australian Government has not yet formally responded to the report or adopted its recommendations. Acting unilaterally in Tasmania ahead of a national policy position is premature and the government looks forward to the Australian Government's response to the report and engaging in future discussions.

It is also relevant to observe Australia's active participation in the development and implementation of the National Consumer Protection Framework for Online Wagering, which represented a cooperative approach between the Commonwealth, states and territories, aimed at reducing the harm of online wagering to Australian consumers. Established through the national policy statement in 2018, the framework has delivered a suite of minimum consumer protections through the adoption of 10 core measures. Which included the introduction of Betstop - the National Self-Exclusion Register that empowers individuals to block themselves from all licenced Australian online and phone gambling providers, offering a practical and effectively effective harm minimisation tool.

This collaborative model of governments working together to provide a nationally consistent policy response has demonstrated that meaningful harm reduction can be achieved through coordinated national action rather than isolated state measures as called for in the motion. The government believes this nationally collaborative approach remains the most effective pathway forward in relation to the substantive matters dealt with in this motion.

The motion draws an analogy between gambling advertising and tobacco advertising bans. While the intent behind this comparison is to present the issue in stark black and white terms, the government does not consider it is an appropriate parallel. Tobacco products are inherently harmful when used as intended, whereas gambling is a legal recreational activity for many Australians when undertaken responsibly. For this reason, the government's policy response to gambling harm is necessarily more nuanced. The approach is grounded in harm minimisation and personal responsibility rather than outright prohibition. The government supports targeted, evidence-based measures rather than the blanket bans. The government considers they are the most effective way to reduce harm while respecting individual choice and maintaining a balanced regulatory framework.

The motion calls for a complete ban on gambling, advertising and sponsorship at all state-owned or state-funded venues, including the proposed Macquarie Point stadium and on players' uniforms. While the government recognises the importance of promoting community well-being, as the motion intends, such measures would have significant economic and practical implications. Sponsorship and advertising revenue plays a role in supporting sporting and entertainment industries.

Any changes of this magnitude require careful consultation with stakeholders, including sporting bodies, community organisations and the public. Regulation of this nature involves developing robust systems, clear definitions and enforcement mechanisms. For example, terms such as 'advertising and sponsorship that normalise or glamourise wagering' are not currently defined in law and there is no established evidence base for applying such standards consistently.

In summary, the government remains committed to reducing gambling harm through targeted evidence-based measures rather than broad prohibitions that may have unintended consequences, with a focus on effective harm minimisation strategies that empower individuals, protect vulnerable people, and maintain a balanced approach between public health and economic realities. While noting the Australian Government has not responded to the 'You win some, you lose more' report, the Tasmanian government will continue to work collaboratively with the Australian Government and other jurisdictions to ensure future policies are nationally consistent, practical and effective. The government acknowledges the importance of this discussion and the concerns expressed in the motion. However, the government is unable to support this motion as presented.

[5.03 p.m.]
Mr EDMUNDS (Pembroke) - I thank the mover and others who have contributed to this debate or discussion.

Of course, I support measures that reduce the harm caused by problem gambling and reducing exposure for young Tasmanians. As you might be able to tell by looking at me, I am a man in my 40s and I do love sport. I watch where I can, including with my family, either live or on TV. Of course I'm concerned about this issue, its impact on the community, on my friends and on my relatives; but this is not Tasmania's jurisdiction. Gambling advertising is regulated by the commonwealth.

We know that gambling advertising plays a role in normalising betting, and we agree that gambling harm is serious. I support harm-minimisation measures, but these must be implemented carefully to avoid unintended consequences for sporting codes, community clubs and venues. To most effectively address this issue, we need a consistent approach across all Australian jurisdictions and reforms must be evidence-based and nationally consistent. We need a national strategy to address gambling advertising, and, I agree with the previous speaker, not piece-meal state-based plans that create confusion and do risk unintended consequences for those state-owned venues, their operators, grassroots sporting clubs and local communities.

I agree with the words of the mover that a comprehensive plan is needed. I will come back to some practical questions I have around the bill as well. Tasmania acting outside of a nationally consistent approach would create fragmented rules and compliance challenges for national sporting leagues and the teams without achieving the intended outcome of reducing gambling harm. National sporting codes operate across multiple states. Fragmented rules create compliance headaches and could disadvantage Tasmanian teams, clubs and organisations. We need a coordinated national approach, as was recommended by the commonwealth House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs.

I do note that the report that has been mentioned by a few speakers, You win some, you lose more, and I note that it recommended a phased national approach, including the prohibition of in-stadia advertising and logos on players uniforms as part of the phase two reforms. While states and territories regulate in-stadia and static advertising, to be most effective, it is important to set a consistent standard across all jurisdictions, as we did when tobacco advertising was banned to protect community health.

We agree that governments have a duty to protect community wellbeing and reduce harm, as I just said was done with tobacco advertising; however, this ban, without a broader strategy that includes things such as education and treatment services, risks being ineffective. When it comes to minimising harm caused by gambling, national consistency matters. A rush ban on local advertising without a broader strategy risk being symbolic rather than effective.

Some of the questions I had about that to apply to Tasmania. Would it mean that a sporting team or club could hold a press conference at Hobart Airport but not at Devonport Airport, because Devonport Airport is government owned? Will teams with advertising on their uniforms that visit Tasmania have to wear their hoodies inside out if they get off the Spirit or if they fly in via Devonport? How does this motion deal with places like Ladbrokes Park Elwick which has a multi-year deal in place?

Also, as we've pointed out, this does not address the issues raised around advertising on television or at mainland venues. I just reiterate my points that when it comes to minimising harm caused by gambling, a national consistency is the best way to deliver that. I don't believe a motion that specifically names up a stadium that won't be built for at least four years is particularly helpful in this debate.

[5.07 p.m.]
Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, thank you, and thank you to the members who have made contributions on the motion. I appreciate that very much. I will sum up relatively briefly, I suspect. I appreciate the member for Mersey raising that this is an attack on sport. No, far from it. It's actually to make sport a family-friendly, enjoyable and safe opportunity, at least when people go to experience it in person in our state, at state-owned/funded venues. I agree it's a positive move forward for Tasmania and for sport in this state.

I appreciate the member for Hobart's comments dispelling that myth around personal responsibility being anything to do with gambling addiction, and I share her concerns around that platform mentality in relation to venues, and how that can actually be insidiously used in in conjunction with the dominance of gambling sponsorship and presence in those venues, very much so.


To be clear: I'm not surprised that the neither the government nor the Labor Party are supporting the motion. It's hardly surprising because they're very reluctant to take responsibility and to make any steps towards leadership on this issue, which is a shame for our state, and certainly a shame for vulnerable people in this state who are currently suffering under gambling addiction, and are not being assisted in any way, shape or form by the policies taken forward by either of the major parties.

The government and the Labor Party's push to say this is a federal responsibility is quite simply shirking the leadership and responsibility that can and should be taken at a state level. We absolutely do have the opportunity to act, and we could, and that would provide a good national light on the hill for others to follow. We are a perfectly sized state to do that and we could implement this [Bookmark: Phr3_O=12.4_D=29.2_C=0.86]  in nuanced ways that suit our state. This is not a prescriptive motion; this is not a motion that comes into immediate effect. It is a motion that calls on action over time and, of course, the details of that could be worked out with good intent, were it to be taken up by the government of the day and supported by the parliament and the opposition of the day. 

Yes, of course, as pointed out by the member for Pembroke on behalf of the Labor Party, this does not affect TV  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=42.5_D=29.4_C=0.85] advertising or the mainland. No, it does not. This is not a panacea motion and never claimed to be so. This is a motion that says here is something we could take responsibility for and improve and suggests that we do that. Of course we need to take actions in other areas, and continue to look for opportunities to reform, with a positive public-health lens, other aspects of the drivers of gambling harm, things that do happen on TV or on the mainland.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=72.6_D=28.9_C=0.85] Doing one thing does not stop us doing another, and it is a really typical strategy of people who argue against positive reform on any gambling matter. It is a typical strategy to say, oh, this does not fix everything, what about this thing over here and that thing over there? What about fixing those? Well, sure, let's have those conversations as well, but why would it stop us taking an action, a clear action we could take to make positive improvement and to better protect people in our community who are  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=102.1_D=9.5_C=0.82] at risk now, who are being harmed now?

Just to be clear and remind people in this Chamber, because it is a while since we spoke about the gambling matter in detail, just to remind people, because it did come up about the impact of this in a social sense, for research tells us very clearly: for every person with a gambling addiction, there are five to ten people around them, so let's say on average seven, just to be on the conservative side, seven people around them being directly impacted by that addiction too. It is friends, family members, employers, neighbours, community members. That is how pervasive this addiction is. 

I am absolutely going to take exception at the assertion in the government contribution that the member for McIntyre, as leader of government business, brought to this place, that the  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=159.7_D=11.9_C=0.77] comparison with tobacco is not relevant. That is an utter furphy to suggest - and the rationale being provided by the government to say we cannot compare tobacco to gambling, is to say that [Bookmark: Phr11_O=172.3_D=30.0_C=0.85]  in terms of the product of tobacco, if you use it as intended, it is likely to be harmful it could easily kill you. We know that. The reality is when it comes to gambling, when you use the product as intended, it is likely to end up - or we know from research, actually, for a certain proportion of people, it will end up leading to an addiction which will harm that person and, say, seven people around them in their life. 

We know that for sure, for example, on pokies for a start. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=202.4_D=29.3_C=0.83]  I'm not as immediately familiar with the data on other forms of gambling addiction, but certainly for pokies, if you use a poker machine as intended, one in six people who do that will become addicted to poker machines. That is a guarantee. That is not anything to do with personal responsibility. It is not anything to do with using the product in any way that is not intended. It is a recreational user of the machine. You sit down regularly in front of it to use it as intended;  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=231.8_D=2.7_C=0.71] one in six people will develop an addiction, full stop.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=235.3_D=21.7_C=0.82] So how dare there be a suggestion that somehow gambling addiction is the responsibility of the person for not using the product responsibly, or appropriately, or as intended? That is rubbish. It is a lie. It is a myth, and it should not be perpetrated in this place by a government who is responsible and cares about the community, so I hope that we never hear such a suggestion again [Bookmark: Phr15_O=257.6_D=3.3_C=0.80]  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=261.9_D=29.4_C=0.80] . Although the Member for Pembroke suggested that I had somehow mentioned the words problem gambling in my motion, I have not. I never used that term because it is not an appropriate term. It is a term that is used in research to categorise, but it is not a concept that is accepted by anyone who operates in this space as being appropriate. If you use the term problem gambling, you are blaming the person for their addiction. That is not valid. It is not  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=291.7_D=2.2_C=0.75] accurate and it is not appropriate to use it as a term.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=300.5_D=4.0_C=0.86] I am all for using targeted, evidence-based approaches when it comes to addressing gambling harm. Let's do that. That's what we were intending to do in this state when we had a pokies card planned, it's been abandoned by the government and never supported by the opposition. How dare they suggest that they are interested in targeted evidence-based approaches? They're not.

This is a targeted approach. This is not saying we're trying to fix everything. This is saying we have sporting venues that are the responsibility of our state, we know that exposure to gambling ads in those sporting venues puts children in our community at risk. We know it inextricably normalises gambling when it comes to those children's experience of sport. It joins those two things together in an unhealthy way that is making them more likely to be at risk of gambling harm and developing a gambling addiction and probably at a relatively young age.

That's a very targeted thing to do. Here's our venues. We're going to decide not to put gambling advertising in them. It's a pretty straightforward idea, supported by evidence. Its targeted evidence-based approach to reducing harm in our community. Again, anybody who suggests that they're interested in targeted, evidence-based approaches can actually comfortably support this motion.

That largely covers my points. There were some questions from the member for Pembroke on the implementation of this, those are not questions that need to be answered in relation to this motion. In the sense that this motion provides for an opportunity for the government to take an approach over a period of time to implement the outcome, which is the ban on advertising in state owned venues.

How the government goes about doing that, the details of how that occurs is entirely then within the policy remit of the government. This is calling for a particular broad action and outcome. The implementation of it can be flexibly addressed by a receptive government, if we had one when it comes to it.

I'll wrap up, I know we've got a long day. I appreciate members engagement with this motion. It's always a challenge when we ask people in this place to support a motion relating to an industry that has such a grip on our political environment. But still, I encourage members to support this motion.

Motion agreed to.

MOTION

Go Gentle Australia Voluntary Assisted Dying in Residential Aged Care Homes – A National Report Card - Consideration and Noting
[5.18 p.m.]

Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - Mr President, I move - 

That Go Gentle Australia Voluntary Assisted Dying in Residential Aged Care Homes – A National Report Card, be considered and noted.

I take again the opportunity to rise to bring to the attention in this place the Go Gentle Australia Voluntary Assisted Dying in Residential Aged Care Homes – A National Report Card. It's not a very long contribution, but important, especially with our own review imminent. I have on good authority from the health minister that the panel is nearly finalised. Once that's finalised, the terms of reference for the three-year review as required by our legislation will be advertised for people from across Tasmania and across the mainland to have input into that.

I have previously forwarded to all members a copy of the Assisted Dying in Residential Age Care Reforms, and it's not a huge report, but it's one that has some very good information for us to improve upon across not only in this state, but across the nation.

When we speak of aged care, we are speaking of the homes of people in their last chapters of their lives. For a person entering an aged care facility, that will be their final place they can call home and also often with only a few of the keepsakes and photographs to hopefully remember a life well lived. When we think of a home we are speaking of dignity, choice and true autonomy. A place of your own.

For a person with a terminal condition that may be enduring unbearable suffering, that sense of control can make all the difference. In Australia, more than 8000 people have applied for access to voluntary assisted dying since 2019, when it first became a legal option in Victoria. All states then report an increase in applications over time with the median age of 73 of those applying for VAD, the overwhelming majority dying of cancer, with 80 per cent that have access to palliative care, all to ease their intolerable suffering from a terminal condition. That's why the right to access to voluntary assisted dying in the place you live must be an inalienable human right.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=26.0_D=3.2_C=0.58] The findings in the National Report on Voluntary Assisted Dying [Bookmark: Phr3_O=29.6_D=20.6_C=0.75]  in Residential Aged Care Homes demands our attention, not as an abstract critique of the sector, but as a challenge to the conscience of us all. The report sought to investigate what information was made available to residents and potential residents of aged care facilities about VAD as a potential end of life choice. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=53.2_D=5.5_C=0.81]  It also looked at the level of access to VAD that an aged care home might allow for resident.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=59.6_D=29.4_C=0.82] It tells us that whilst voluntary assisted dying is now a lawful choice in every state and the ACT commencing on 1 November this year, far too many residential aged care homes are not giving prospective and current residents clear, accessible information about whether or even how that choice can be exercised in what is their final home. Both facts sit uneasily together. The law recognises the right; the law too often erects an invisible barrier.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=92.5_D=1.0_C=0.86] Let me be frank. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=94.2_D=29.9_C=0.80]  When a person moves into a residential aged care home, that facility is their home in every meaningful way. It should not be a place where vital choices are hidden or withheld. To enter a home that often comes at considerable expense without knowing whether the end-of-life options you lawfully hold will be respected is a grave inequity, boarding on malfeasance.

The 25 largest national aged care providers and 20 largest service providers in each state [Bookmark: Phr9_O=124.6_D=8.4_C=0.75]  were contacted directly as this is a national report, given the chance to respond and encouraged be transparent in their response. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=134.0_D=26.1_C=0.75]  The result was a traffic light style rating assessment. Some providers with clear public and person-centred information and full access to the entire VAD process. Others with limited information and only secondary access to VAD processes from external VAD health professionals, or a surprisingly large number with no public information on VAD access or that it restricts or does not support VAD on its premises.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=160.8_D=13.2_C=0.79] The purpose of these inquiries is not to castigate, but to shed light so that families can make informed choices, providers can understand where best practise lies, and governments can ensure that law and care align.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=174.7_D=16.3_C=0.76] The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission in a 2024 report on aged care stated - [tbc 5.23]

A provider that decides not to take part will still have to meet its provider responsibility to support residents right to exercise choice to access the VAD process.

Why does this matter? [Bookmark: Phr13_O=192.0_D=29.6_C=0.82]  Because restricting access to information about voluntary assisted dying causes harm. If a person is forced to move in the final weeks or days of their life to exercise a lawful choice, the harm is real. It is physical, it is emotional, it is often vindictive. Short journeys can be agonising. Transfers away from familiar environments can diminish the quality of dying. We must not create a system in which only those with the means or the capacity to uproot [Bookmark: Phr14_O=221.8_D=24.2_C=0.69]  themselves can truly access their legal options. There is also an argument about dignity. Person-centred care is not a generic slogan. It's a standard that must be reflected in daily practise. Respecting a resident's right to be informed about their options, including VAD where it is lawful, is an essential part of respecting them as members of our community with their own values, beliefs and choices that must be honoured.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=247.3_D=3.4_C=0.70] The report gave a state-by-state breakdown [Bookmark: Phr16_O=251.8_D=6.8_C=0.81] . I'm happy to report that whilst almost all states could do better, Tasmania did better than most [Bookmark: Phr17_O=259.2_D=12.9_C=0.72] , with a nation leading 50 per cent of Tasmanian providers making comprehensive VAD information available despite no obligation to do so, this is against a national average of 18 per cent. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=272.8_D=27.6_C=0.73]  As an aside, our legislation is silent on residential aged care and VAD access where it's a right in South Australia, Queensland, NSW legislation for permanent residents. Tasmania at 30 per cent also has the highest proportion of providers with public information confirming full access to VAD and 20 per cent with secondary access to VAD. It still leaves 50 per cent with no restricted or unpublic [Bookmark: Phr19_O=301.5_D=3.0_C=0.47]  access which, whilst low by the national average of an 85 per cent, is still half of our providers that choose not to share that information. To its credit, One Care Tasmania and particularly the team at One Care Rubicon Grove in Port Sorrell, which I'm pleased is in my patch, was highlighted in the report as an example of best-practice to other providers.

The report gave an example of residents of VAD Journey with staff that were well informed, compassionate and accommodating and went beyond and above the care for his needs as he went through the VAD process. It's examples like these that show what is possible in a faith-based setting where it's the need of a person that comes first and foremost.

As an aside, one of the nurses that was involved with that - and she won't mind me saying - involved with that VAD event, actually we did a 20-kilometre horse ride and she spoke about what happened and how wonderful it was and how the family were so thankful and how the whole Rubicon Grove, they knew what was going on, everyone was so respectful of the process.

It actually was a good learning experience not only for the staff but other residents and how it could be done properly. Glenn Williams, the Chief Clinical Officer at One Care, has a view that their aged-care homes play a critical role in creating a calm, supportive environment and ensuring continuity of care.

They've worked closely with the state's VAD Commission and the VAD Care Navigator Team to educate staff and foster ongoing communication with residents. He went on to say:

It shouldn't be a clinical event; it's part of life. We provide a natural home-like environment for residents who choose VAD.

The report sets out four clear recommendations and they bear repeating here because they are straightforward and they are practical. First, providers must make public, clear and up-to-date information about voluntary assisted dying. That information must be written in clear language that's free of jargon, free of moralising strictures, and easy to find.

If a right exists in law, access to knowledge of that right should not be hidden away in hearsay or the owner's policy doctrine. A person having to decide between homes needs to know upfront: does this place allow voluntarist to die on-site, under what conditions? What supports will be provided and who can assist me in understanding the process?

Secondly, providers should give a clear public explanation of the level of VAD access supported on their premises and the stages of the VAD process can happen here. Some providers may choose not to actively participate in the process. That is their legal perspective and conscientious objection is a recognised stance, no matter how moralistically cruel it is, but that position carries responsibility.

A provider who will not participate must still support a resident's legal right to access the process. They must explain how they will facilitate it, whether by permitting external practitioners on site, by offering temporary relocation within the facility or by assisting with transport arrangements and the limits of those arrangements.

Thirdly, providers need a proper voluntary assisted dying policy, procedures that staff understand, trainings that build competence and confidence, and practical steps to ensure residents' wishes are respected without causing unnecessary delay or distress.

We need a culture where end-of-life conversations are handled with skill and compassion and within the obligations of the legislation. I want to put on the record that that's where our legislation is in advance to some of the others in the fact that we do allow our registered nurses to do the trainings, do the modules, and some of those registered nurses do take up positions within aged-care facilities and that's a very big bonus for the Tasmanian situation.

Lastly, state and federal governments should monitor and encourage residential aged-care providers to comply fully with relevant legislation, regulatory framework and obligations. I want to emphasise that these recommendations are not merely bureaucratic; they are moral and practical. They preserve choice, reduce harm and ensure equity. Where regional and rural communities are faced with limited alternatives, these measures are especially important. The ability to find another facility 100 kilometres away is not an option for someone in their last days.

Dr Linda Swan, as the CEO of Go Gentle Australia, has heard of frail and sick aged-care residents being forced to move to another care home to access VAD - not here in our state. She has also heard from residents who have only learned about VAD when it was too late, as well as families who are angry that their loved ones suffered unnecessarily. She said:

Older people have a legal right to know their options at the end of life, including VAD, and they have a right to know this information before they choose the facility that they will become their home. There is a further pragmatic point. Good transparency builds trust. Providers that are open about their position and their processes will gain the confidences of prospective residents and their families. The report shares examples of best-practice providers. They show that clarity is possible and that it can be achieved with compassion for residents' immediate needs and without moral compromise.  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.2_D=30.0_C=0.65] Even in faith-based organisation, maybe as a perfect expression of the Christian faith where kindness and compassion are a guiding tenet.

In closing I return to a simple principle where your home should not be a place where legal choices are concealed. A person's final residence should be where their dignity is honoured and their autonomy is respected and fully supported. This report is a call to action. We have Tasmania's example of best practice that demonstrates  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.3_D=7.6_C=0.82] clarity from providers with practical policies and training that allows staff to support residents with kindness and compassion.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=69.0_D=23.3_C=0.84] Above all, let us make sure that when the law grants the choice to a person on how they might end their intolerable suffering, the reality of care does not take it away from them. 

I would like to also acknowledge the Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing in the Chamber today, and I would like to put on the record my gratitude for her recent announcement that there will be a portal for  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=93.4_D=2.5_C=0.54] voluntary assisted dying I have had many  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=97.9_D=0.2_C=0.96] doctors  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=98.5_D=7.2_C=0.81] contact me and saying that is a great step, so I do acknowledge and thank you for that. 

I can remember in my journey when I travelled to  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=107.6_D=21.7_C=0.73] Vancouver early on. I met with Dr Ellen Wiebe who was the main instigator of the medicinal assistance in dying in Canada, her and [inaudible] who wrote the legislation. They had a specific issue in Vancouver where there was a faith-based hospice that was against, and it happened  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=129.6_D=30.0_C=0.81] that they were forced to leave that place because of the guidelines associated with that hospice. But eventually they took it to their High Court, I am not going to say the Supreme Court, their highest court in the land and they challenged that, saying that the person's rights outweighed the rights of the guidelines of the hospice. Therefore, that was allowed to take place because she said it was far too [Bookmark: Phr10_O=160.0_D=14.8_C=0.90]  harmful for the person to be moved in the last few days of their life, in such pain, and that would be inhumane. On those things, I appreciate  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=176.2_D=15.2_C=0.77] the aged care homes from Go Gentle. I congratulate them on all they work to do, and I am really hoping that the Northern Territory can join with the other states and territories in Australia and be able to offer  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=192.2_D=4.6_C=0.80] those people suffering the choice of voluntary assisted dying. I commend the report.

[5.33 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=211.5_D=27.6_C=0.82] Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, thank you, and I also thank the honourable member for Mersey for bringing this important report card to the council's attention. Also today, I would like to take this opportunity to again thank the honourable member for his continued commitment, passion and work over many years on the End of Life Choices Voluntary Assisted Dying Bill and your continued advocacy in this space.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=240.2_D=29.3_C=0.85] The government absolutely supports the aims of the Go Gentle Australia Voluntary Assisted Dying in the Residential Aged-Care Home National Report Card. It is fundamental that aged care residents have the right to access services which are legally available to other people in the community, along with the information about those services needed, to support informed decision-making for themselves and for their families.
 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=269.8_D=2.4_C=0.68]  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=272.9_D=6.5_C=0.86] The report card notes a general lack of transparency around access [Bookmark: Phr18_O=280.1_D=17.1_C=0.80]  to voluntary assisted dying for residents in residential aged-care facilities, demonstrating that many residential aged-care facilities are not providing residents the minimal required information about the voluntary assisted dying service.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=297.8_D=7.2_C=0.83] It should be noted that the comments by Go Gentle are, of course, broadly presented and paint a picture of the practices across all Australian jurisdictions where voluntary assisted dying is legal. It is worth pointing out that the statistics presented by Go Gentle, when broken down by each jurisdiction, show that Tasmanian aged care facilities score better and higher than aged care facilities in any other jurisdictions.

According to the report card, it is pleasing to note that Tasmanian aged care facilities provide better quality of voluntary assisted dying information than aged care facilities in other jurisdictions. A better proportion of Tasmanian aged care facilities provide full access to voluntary assisted dying than in any other jurisdictions. Compared with other jurisdictions, Tasmanian aged care facilities are less likely to provide no access or restricted access to voluntary assisted dying services.

With voluntary assisted dying legislated in Tasmania in late 2022, and there will be some here that will remember that well, it's commendable Tasmanian aged care facilities have quickly accommodated their communications and practices to this statewide service which is available to all eligible Tasmanians. It has encouraged those aged care facilities who are not communicating about this statewide service to consider reaching out to the commission to seek further information on the documents and support available. 

In supporting these facilities to develop policies for voluntary assisted dying in Tasmania, the government makes available to every facility a guideline document on policy development and provides also ongoing policy advice, education and, as needed, updated information on the legislative requirements of voluntary assisted dying. The Tasmanian Voluntary Assisted Dying Navigation Service provides more generally a central point of contact for information and support about voluntary assisted dying to people, families, carers and health professionals, including residential aged care residents and their families, and health workers and administrators of residential aged care facilities.

With the ongoing help and guidance provided by the government, and with the support of the Tasmanian Statewide Voluntary Assisted Dying Navigation Service, it is expected that the residents of Tasmanian aged care facilities will continue to be supported in making an informed choice. This support, and the information and care which underpins it, is the right of all residents of aged care facilities, no matter whether a resident considers voluntary assisted dying to be a suitable option for themselves or not. Mr. President, the motion is supported.

[5.38 p.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - Thank you, leader, I do appreciate the government's response. I think that it's something that we're doing really well in this state and must continue to do that. Thank you.

Motion agreed to.

MOTION

Project Marinus Whole-of-State Business Case and Federal Government Agreement

Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - Mr President, I move - 

That the Legislative Council calls on the government to release immediately:
the full, unredacted Project Marinus Whole-of-State Business Case; and

the Project Marinus agreement signed by Minister Duigan and the federal government.

In the lead-up to the final investment decision on Project Marinus, the government made a promise to the Tasmanian people. It pledged to provide a whole-of-state business case which was to comprehensively consider the opportunities and impact of Project Marinus for Tasmania, and pledged to do so 30 days in advance of making a final investment decision. The government received the finalised business case from the Department of Treasury and Finance on 16 May 2025 and yet released nothing to the public for a long time afterwards. Just over a fortnight later, the no-confidence motion passed the other place, and we were in full-on election mode, barely 16 months after the last one. We all know how that turned out.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.4_D=24.5_C=0.78] In normal circumstances, you would hope the salutary and sobering response for the government may have caused a pause for thought. Back to Marinus, with pre-and-post-election chatter about the yet-to-be-published business case, the government was very shy about sharing the details with elected members. Opposition and crossbench members of parliaments, after signing confidentiality agreements to prevent any public discussion [Bookmark: Phr3_O=52.4_D=2.5_C=0.63] , were finally given limited access to the documents [Bookmark: Phr4_O=55.5_D=4.3_C=0.83] , frustratingly only for a confidential, read-only briefing [Bookmark: Phr5_O=62.1_D=24.1_C=0.72]  on 29 July, after which minister Nick Duigan, as Minister for Energy and Renewables, immediately signed the Marinus Agreement with the federal government in the post-election caretaker period. 

I'm sure we can all remember that this was a particularly fractious period, with the Premier still lacking the certainty that his minority government would continue [Bookmark: Phr6_O=86.6_D=5.4_C=0.83] , a matter that was finally put to rest on 19 August with Labor's failed no-confidence motion. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=92.5_D=29.8_C=0.79]  It was only after the agreement was signed and locked in did the government at last provide the whole-of-state business case to the public, breaking the promise made to Tasmanians to release the document 30 days before making the final investment decision. What is more, significant portions of the business case were redacted. On its website, the Department of Treasury and Finance states that:

The full report provides substantial additional information, but has sections which have been redacted to protect confidential and commercially-sensitive information [Bookmark: Phr8_O=123.0_D=11.1_C=0.65]  at the request of the following affected parties: TasNetworks, Marinus Link Pty Ltd, Hydro Tasmania, Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Government.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=134.7_D=27.6_C=0.77] The extent to which the Marinus business case was redacted was surprising to many. If it was to be printed, you would use a fair bit of black ink and toner. Tasmanians had expected to receive considerably more information than they were allowed to read. The result was a strong public backlash to the government's handling of the Marinus business case and final investment decision. In news articles, press releases and public meetings, the wider community expressed outrage at what had taken place.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=163.5_D=29.4_C=0.73] 'Public trust in the state's roll-out of renewables, particularly in areas most impacted by Marinus, is on a knife edge,' said Environment Tasmania CEO James Overington in a press release. 'Pushing this enormous and highly controversial project through behind closed doors and whilst in caretaker mode would represent a killer blow to any hopes of securing social licence for Tasmanian's energy transition,' energy and climate campaigner Maddie McShane added.

'The level of [Bookmark: Phr11_O=193.0_D=25.0_C=0.74]  secrecy regarding this project is undemocratic,' Bob Campbell, chair of the Tomahawk Protection Society, wrote in a press release. 'What is in the business case that the Liberals want to hide from everyone? This is becoming a pattern of behaviour: get an expert report and then ignore it if it does not say what you want to hear. Tasmanians deserve more from their elected representatives.' Kim Phillips-Haines, a tourism [Bookmark: Phr12_O=218.7_D=2.8_C=0.42]  business owner and representative of Tas Power Democracy [Bookmark: Phr13_O=221.9_D=3.8_C=0.79] , who spoke at a community meeting in Ulverstone, had the following to say [Bookmark: Phr14_O=226.7_D=29.4_C=0.76] :

For those of you who have not yet looked at the Marinus business case document, I encourage you to do so. It is deeply troubling. In places the document is heavily redacted, with entire pages almost completely blackened out and whole graphs covered with black or else their numbers concealed.

The strength of public feeling that erupted in relation to the redacted Marinus business case led 12 Tasmanian community groups and organisations, including the Bob Brown Foundation [Bookmark: Phr15_O=256.2_D=9.6_C=0.71]  and the Tasmanian Constitution Society, to write an open letter to the Energy minister, Nick Duigan, calling him either to restore democracy to energy policy or else resign. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=266.4_D=13.7_C=0.75]  The open letter raised further issues about the terms of the Marinus Link Agreement signed by minister Duigan, particularly in relation to whether the contract has a termination clause as specified in the guidelines on caretaker conventions.  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=280.6_D=18.2_C=0.79] The 12 Tasmanian organisations expressed their concerns that if the Marinus Agreement does not contain the required termination clause, I quote from the letter:

It could set a dangerous precedent which could potentially be used by future governments to justify flagrant breaches of caretaker conventions.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=300.4_D=4.6_C=0.55] Craig Garland MP posed a question on behalf of a constituent to Mr Duigan in the other place on 11 September 2025, requesting to know whether the Marinus agreement contained the specified termination clause. However, in the Energy Minister's nearly two-page reply to this question on 17 October, there was no clear answer to Mr Garland's question. Mr President, perhaps the minister would like to help clarify his response with us here today.

Another issue raised since then is whether all the proper processes were followed when Mr Duigan, as Minister for Energy and Renewables, signed a new agreement to advance the Marinus Link project with the Federal Government raising Tasmania's 2022 commitment to stage one from $53 million to $103 million and what effect potential errors might have on the validity of the Marinus contract.

Legal advice from council has been obtained which confirms this concern. If that advice is correct, then the validity of the agreement could be constitutionally compromised. It leaves open the possibility the State of Tasmania may not be legally bound under the agreement and that obligations purportedly entered into could be unenforceable. This is not a mere technicality. It goes to the heart of constitutional compliance in the integrity of government decision making. I quote excerpts from that legal advice, [tbc 5.46]

On the 31st of July 2025, Duigan declared that he personally signed a new agreement with the Commonwealth Government to advance the Marinus Link project. No publicly available copy of the agreement Nick Duigan signed on the 31st of July 2025 has been disclosed or released. News reports confirm the deal was struck and announced that the Tasmanian Government has only issued press releases and media statements summarising its terms, not the full contract text.

The quote continues.

The new agreement, signed by Nick Duigan as the current Minister for Energy and Renewals on the 31st of July 2025, purportedly raises Tasmanian's financial commitment to $103 million, marking the final investment decision for Stage 1. There is no indication as to where the Duigan signed merely a political commitment or he signed a binding agreement contract committing Tasmania to legally binding financial obligations with another party or parties. This signing occurred during the caretaker period without tabling of the business case and without evidence of statutory delegation or governor's authority. If he signed a binding agreement in his own name or ministerial title, it could be said that Duigan acted outside the scope of lawful power and in direct contradiction to administrative frameworks. This could place Duigan in having signed major public funding agreements without lawful authority in defiance of statutory and constitutional requirements. To assist in determining Tasmania's liability and whether the Marinus Agreement legally binds Tasmania, it would be prudent to obtain copies of the agreement Duigan signed. Hence it remains uncertain if Tasmania is legally bound or whether it is party to a non-binding political commitment only.

End of quote. Mr President, what is certain is that the whole state business case has not been tabled and no enabling legislation has passed this place prior to the signing of the agreement, notwithstanding the potential breach of the constitution and lawful powers. The minister signed the agreement barely 10 days after the election.

Outwardly, it appears to be a rash action with a degree of hast and impropriety, especially so when the government and its public service were still subject to caretaker conventions. Even more so when the ability for the Liberal Party to even form a new government had not yet been fully established. The controversy surrounding the Marinus whole state business case and the agreement signed with the federal government has severely undermined public trust in the entire project.

 One of the consequences of that proportion of landholders affected by the North West Transmission Developments have refused to sign any contract or accept any offer of strategic benefit payment or accept any other compensation and say they will not permit the construction of transmission infrastructure on their land. They issued a joint statement to that effect, declaring that the proposed North West Transmission Developments and Marinus Development is not in Tasmania's best interests and does not have a social licence.

These landholders have further told the media that they intend to take legal action against TasNetworks, which could make it difficult for the North West Transmission Developments project to be delivered on time and on budget, even if it eventually ends up going ahead. For a Liberal government to lose the trust of landowners is surely a first and points to the frustration and distrust in the process that has been created by the actions of this government - actions that appear to have violated caretaker conventions and concealed the issue from genuine and fully informed public debate.

As a third Liberal government in as many years, with two of them as minorities, I would have thought it would have been keenly aware of the Tasmanian community's exasperation with its dismal track record in managing major projects. Yet it merrily continues on its way, committing future generations to projects that defy independent expert analysis and load us with insurmountable debt.

Whilst individual members of the government may have financial security and wealth beyond the imagination of a community struggling with the cost-of-living crisis, Tasmanians are keenly aware of the risks to our home state of overextending government borrowing on what appears to be vanity projects.

The rating agency Moody's has just downgraded our state credit rating to a AA3. In their words, this was due to a: [tbc 5.51]

sharp, sustained increase in Tasmania's debt and interest burdens…

and:

although large-scale investments in energy, ports and Australian projects may support long-term growth and revenue, their substantial upfront costs will add to debt burden, weaken debt affordability and contribute to pressure on recurring operating expenses.

What this credit rating downgrade means in practical terms is that the government will have to pay higher interest rates on new debt and when rolling over maturing debt. According to renowned economist Saul Eslake, every dollar that the government spends on interest is a dollar that can't be spent on hospitals, schools, police, policing and other services. We could be in for even more pain in the future, because as Mr Eslake explains in his independent review of Tasmania's state finances, at the rate our government debt is climbing, there could be yet another downgrade to Tasmania's credit rating within the next 10 years.

If the government is to have any hope of regaining public trust and obtaining the necessary social licence for the Marinus Link and the North West Transmission developments, it must release the full unredacted Marinus business case as well as the Marinus agreement that Energy minister Nick Duigan sighed with the federal government.

If the project is too good to turn down, then what does the government have to hide? Show us the detail. Only then will the people of Tasmania have an opportunity to properly examine the information and decide whether these projects truly stack up and are in the best interest of our state.

We cannot afford to fly blind into these projects. Marinus is the largest proposed investment in Tasmania's history, and the people have a right to know what they're being signed up for. To bulldoze these projects through to the construction phase amidst ongoing public controversy and claims of government secrecy will only further erode public trust and would go against expected standards of open democracy.

We are not in the USA where apparently what the President says goes and is completely unaccountable. The Tasmanian government must release the unredacted business case. It must release the Marinus agreement signed by the minister. Only then can we have a sense of true moral commitment to transparent democracy. I thank members for their attention.

I commend the motion to the House.

[5.53 p.m.]
Mr DUIGAN (Windermere - Minister for Energy and Renewables) - Mr President, it is my pleasure to rise on this occasion to speak to the motion and outline the final investment decision on Project Marinus and the material that underpinned it. First of all, I would like to emphasise that the government has always sought to be open and transparent in its decisions on Project Marinus. There was, and remains, a great deal of governance oversight around this project. As the member has mentioned, it is a very, very large project. It is an important project for Tasmania's future. It is a project that exists in two main parts: Marinus Link, which is the undersea part, and the Northwest Transmission Development, the Burnie to Cressy coastal route, which is stage 1 of Marinus Link.

What I have said as minister, and what the government has said all along, is we would only make a positive final investment decision on Project Marinus if it stacked up for Tasmania. I am absolutely confident that Project Marinus will deliver long-term economic and energy security benefits for Tasmania. It will of course support new investment in renewable energy generation. That's one thing it will help. It will stabilise the national electricity market with massive carbon offset benefits as coal is exited from that market and ensure Tasmania can maximise the value of its hydroelectric resources and by doing so allow Tasmanians to enjoy more returns from the outstanding assets that our forefathers and forebears are constructed on the island throughout the course of the last 100 years.

The project is also expected to generate billions in additional economic activity and support thousands of jobs, and Marinus Link will unlock new opportunities for advanced manufacturing support emerging industries again, carbon reducing industries like clean fuels and hydrogen derivatives. Of course, there are other opportunities as well in that space, in the load generating area.

The final investment decision needed to be made under caretaker conventions was neither desirable or avoidable and that's the very clear case that we as government were put in. We were very clear prior to being aware an election would be called that Tasmania's final investment decision, understanding that Project Marinus is a tripartite entity owned by the Tasmanian, Commonwealth and Victorian Governments and there were and remained very hard deadlines around procurement orders that Marinus Link had for both its cable and its converter stations.

That was not a deadline that we imposed. It was a very real deadline and once the election was called the government, of course, operated under the caretaker convention. An important part of the governance put in place to manage the assessment of project Marinus in the lead up to the FID was the work overseen by the Energy Executive Steering Committee, which is a secretary level steering committee led by and chaired by Secretary Limpkin.

From the perspective of the government, we're aware that caretaker convention states a preference for major policy decisions to be avoided if possible, so as not to unnecessarily buy into future government. What needs to be recognised in this instance and as we tried to move that final investment decision date beyond the election and hopefully into a state where a a new government could make that decision.

Eventually we became against a rock and a hard place and had to make a decision, and this is important, noting that no decision would have a very material impact on the project. There was not an opportunity to not make a decision by doing nothing, we risked adding five years potentially to the project and that was very strong, very consistent, unambiguous advice coming from numerous sources.

The positive FID announced on 1 August, and the positive FID was consistent with advice received on the Project Marinus FID assessment report and that was signed off by the Secretary level Energy Executive Steering committee. We also had an expert advisory panel which similarly gave positive advice to government.

Likewise, we received positive advice in in the nature of positive FID recommendations from both Marinus Link and from TasNetworks. There was a lot of information coming in and feeding this decision. At the same time, and it's important to recognise there were ongoing discussions with the commonwealth government about what it might be able to do to make Marinus Link even better for Tasmanians, we were - and I was - engaged heavily in those discussions [Bookmark: Phr2_O=13.2_D=16.5_C=0.84] . In terms of information contained within the whole-of-state business case, we were very reluctant and remain very reluctant to share some of that information about, particularly from my perspective, [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.8_D=0.6_C=0.90]  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=33.2_D=10.3_C=0.91]  the information that relates to our state-owned electricity generator. The commonwealth would potentially seek to have the state [Bookmark: Phr5_O=45.1_D=23.7_C=0.80]  use that entity to provide certain outcomes and we were very keen information pertaining to that valuable state-held entity remains confidential.

Having said that through the caretaker conventions [Bookmark: Phr6_O=69.9_D=1.0_C=0.80] , which would [Bookmark: Phr7_O=72.5_D=14.3_C=0.81]  suggest or call for a government who was making a decision to share that information and the nature of that decision with the opposition, Well, we went further than that and shared our thinking and the information behind it [Bookmark: Phr8_O=87.0_D=16.2_C=0.88]  with all parliamentarians, where you were given access to all of the documentation that had informed our decision, noting it was only for a brief period of time. Since that time, I have offered to make that unredacted [Bookmark: Phr9_O=103.6_D=26.2_C=0.84]  information available to the Public Accounts Committee. I have written, and the Treasurer has written to the chair of the Public Accounts Committee offering that documentation to live within PAC, noting that PAC has certain legislation surrounding it that would protect that information, which we would seek to continue to protect.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=150.7_D=27.0_C=0.81] The FID decision documents which is the FID assessment report, the expert advisory panel report and the whole estate business case which have been released publicly, but in a redacted form. There were commercial and other confidential information contained within those documents and none of the redactions were made by [Bookmark: Phr13_O=177.9_D=5.4_C=0.80]  me or any other ministers. They were made by departments, as you would expect [Bookmark: Phr14_O=186.0_D=6.3_C=0.88] . The key conclusions and recommendations, importantly in those documents, have not been redacted. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=195.4_D=12.0_C=0.67]  As I was saying, with Public Accounts, the Public Accounts Committee Act 1970 provide protections for confidential material. The commonwealth, as is part of our agreement [Bookmark: Phr16_O=210.3_D=10.0_C=0.89] , the agreement between the three parties, agreed to release of the unredacted material to the Public Accounts Committee on the condition of that confidentiality.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=222.2_D=9.8_C=0.75] I would say that offer to release to PAC was not accepted, but the offer remains. However, I would take this opportunity [Bookmark: Phr18_O=233.9_D=4.1_C=0.88] , because I think the chair wrote back to me and the Treasurer and said that perhaps the Energy [Bookmark: Phr19_O=238.1_D=24.6_C=0.85]  Matters Committee might have been a better place for that documentation to go. The Treasurer and I have agreed to provide these documents in their unredacted form on the same condition of confidentiality that was requested of the Public Accounts Committee, so these documents can go to the Energy Matters [Bookmark: Phr20_O=263.4_D=5.3_C=0.75]  Committee and members there have full and  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=270.6_D=23.0_C=0.83] untimed limited access to those.

The Marinus Link Shareholders Agreement allows for disclosure of confidential information for public accountability reasons or as a request from parliament or a parliamentary committee. As a matter of good governance, we would consult with the other shareholders, Victoria and the Commonwealth, in relation to any request to release confidential information. [Bookmark: Phr22_O=294.6_D=5.0_C=0.75]  It's not possible to table the documents here in a public sense without breaching [Bookmark: Phr23_O=300.1_D=4.9_C=0.75]  the confidences of our project Marinus partners and without putting at risk commercial interests of, as I say, Hydro Tasmania - amongst others, but specifically Hydro Tasmania - for whom we have fought very long and hard to keep its information private. I should make the point that those negotiations with the Commonwealth, on the back of keeping that information private, have led to a $346 million grant to TasNetworks for the Northwest Transmission Developments, or a grant against its ratable asset base, which will reduce cost to customers and that's the that's the only intention of that grant. 

It also kept our equity funding of Marinus Link at $103.5 million. I noticed you made some comments around that. That figure - $103.5 million - was the amount of money which had been expended on Project Marinus while it was a wholly owned subsidiary of TasNetworks. As we moved into that tripartite agreement with Victoria and the Commonwealth, we were able to have that $103.5 million recognised as equity contributed. Also, through the negotiation we were able to cap our level of equity into Marinus Link. There's already been a subsequent equity call for Marinus Link and Tasmania hasn't been required to contribute additional equity into that, because our equity is capped and our equity stake in the company reduces over time as further equity calls come.

I would like to be as absolutely open and transparent as I'm able to be, because I see so many benefits from Project Marinus and what it will mean for Tasmania going forward. Energy security is just one of those, and I think it's worth considering that we've just come out of the two driest years on record in terms of hydro inflows. 

Having connectivity into the NEM (National Electricity Market) is so important for us as a state and for our energy security. If you contemplate that Bass Link's already 20-years old and halfway through its service life and that a project like Marinus takes around about 15 years from conception to delivery, we have to have these conversations now about we will do about further connectivity with the NEM.

Having this project delivered by governments as opposed to the private market means that we get all the benefits of the concessional finance rates. Both Marinus Link and the Northwest Transmission Developments - particularly the northwest - are backed by heavily concessional finance from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, again, the rate of that concessional finance is very tightly held for good reason, and also that very large $346 million federal grant. 

There are a number of reasons why I would seek to have these documents held to be available for people to see them. It is it is a challenging thing to put into the public realm. I would ask members to act in what I would say is the best interests of the state to keep our hydro numbers to ourselves. There are good reasons for doing that amongst some other things. 

I do not support the motion. Thank you. 

Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, I'm happy to stand and add my voice to the honourable member for Mersey's call for the release of the full and unredacted Project Marinus whole-of-state business case and Project Marinus agreement signed by the State Minister and the federal government. 

I may say 'I'm happy,' but that's a heavily qualified statement. I'm actually quite disturbed and even angry that for a project of this magnitude with such immediate and long-term ramifications for Tasmania, we have to stand in this place and formally seek to secure full public disclosure of fundamental documents pivotal to the project and to the community's confidence in that project, which is clearly still lacking; that we have been put in this position by the state government, which barely misses any chance to trumpet its self-congratulatory claims that it's the most open and transparent government ever. All that needs to happen is for those claims to be written in all caps and you'd have a Trump-esque tweet to put forward, both in presentation and in hubris. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=21.7_D=8.8_C=0.76]  It's utterly inaccurate. I feel I have a responsibility to add my voice here to the honourable member's pertinent and reasonable call for full transparency [Bookmark: Phr4_O=33.8_D=27.4_C=0.84] , especially in relation to the government's actions and those key documents upon which the actions are based regarding the project.

As the member for Mersey has outlined, so I will not go over the ground again in detail, that despite promises to release the whole-of-state business case to the general public 30 days before making its final investment decision, the government failed to do so. Instead, after having backed itself into a convention-period corner in late July this year, the government required MPs to swear secrecy [Bookmark: Phr5_O=61.4_D=19.4_C=0.81] , who were at the 11th hour provided with an extremely unsatisfactory speed-reading access to the mountains of whole-of-state business case folders, after which the Energy minister promptly signed the agreement with the federal government. 

Then, after the agreement was signed, in flagrant breach of the commitment to release it before the decision was made, the whole-of-state business case was released. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=82.2_D=15.2_C=0.83]  Well, sections of it were released, anyway. This broken promise and sleight-of-hand have escalated the serious disquiet within the community around both the ramifications of Marinus, but also whether they can trust what the government tells them about a project of this magnitude. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=97.9_D=28.8_C=0.81]  People cannot trust that the decision was the best decision made thanks to these public contortions.

What we do know is the government essentially delegated its final investment decision to an expert assessment panel. That panel was comprised of five energy executives. Two were from Hydro Tas and one from TasNetworks. Both of those entities will benefit directly from Marinus going ahead. The expert advisory panel produced its report in July this year. Unsurprisingly, they gave the project the tick of approval and the government followed suit. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=127.5_D=11.1_C=0.75]  Unsurprisingly, the panel's report has been released and it's unredacted. Funny that a glowing report gets released in full. Clearly nothing of concern to see there.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=140.6_D=28.8_C=0.77] It's also worth noting the government also relied heavily on a report prepared by the Department of Energy Executive Steering Committee, which is chaired by the Secretary of State Growth. The other members were the Secretary of DPAC, Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of NRE Tas, and acting CEO of ReCFIT. This departmental Energy Executive Steering Committee prepared an 111-page report called the Final Investment Decision Assessment Report and notably, this report is heavily redacted. This is where we see the secrecy surrounding the information [Bookmark: Phr10_O=169.4_D=9.8_C=0.74]  provided to the government upon which it based its final decision, and it begs the question, given the full release of one energy expert panel's report, why the other has been redacted so heavily?

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=181.0_D=24.6_C=0.80] The material redactions of the Final Investment Decision Assessment Report (FIDAR) that would assist in critically assessing the government's decision to go ahead with Marinus include, and I am going to highlight a few for the members, interest. Transmission pricing impact are redacted at page 42 of the report, as is the identity of the person who did the modelling for State Growth on page 43, begging to question why is there modelling that we haven't been provided? [Bookmark: Phr12_O=206.0_D=5.1_C=0.85]  The apparent value of the wholesale price benefit has been deleted from page 44. The size of the additional loan required [Bookmark: Phr13_O=211.4_D=28.6_C=0.73]  by the Northwest Transmission Developments from TASCORP is redacted from page 52. There is projected to be a net loss to the government over the first 25 years, but exactly how much that net loss is has been redacted in Page 10. The profit projection of Hydro in a no-Marinus scenario on page 85 has been redacted, yet the profit projections with Marinus have been provided and half of the page for project costs due diligence is redacted at page 103. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=240.0_D=1.3_C=0.69] 

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=241.6_D=23.8_C=0.79] There are also those pages which have been redacted in their entirety, despite it being arguable these examples of redacted information are in the public interest. Despite the fact this motion is not calling for the release of the FIDAR, it's worth highlighting the degree to which that document has also been redacted, and relevant information appears to be being kept from us. This provides another example of the secrecy surrounding this significant project.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=266.6_D=4.7_C=0.67] Yes, some of these reductions may be valid on a commercial and confidence basis, but when people are [Bookmark: Phr17_O=271.9_D=22.1_C=0.79]  provided pages which are more blacked out than not, it only serves to undermine and weaken confidence in the application of that assessment. It also serves to highlight some of the questionable redaction choices and prioritisations and raises serious questions over whether the choice of what information is or is not released is influenced by government narrative and spin rather than the application of a rigorous public-interest test.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=295.4_D=9.6_C=0.77] Moving on to the whole-of-state business case, which is the main subject of this motion, I share the disbelief over the degree of redactions in that release document and the frustration over the manner of its release, which to be frank, felt shady and slippery to say the least; particularly when the whole-of-state business case was promised to be released in a timely manner for the community to inform itself on the decision options which were before the government regarding Project Marinus. 

As we know, that didn't happen. Then, to add insult to injury, a heavily redacted version was released. As the member for Mersey stated: 

No doubt the producers of black toner would have received a boost in sales!

The following summary is of some of the more potentially egregious reductions that may be of interest to members:

On page 60, a large slab of text related to the Northwest Transmission Developments is missing, despite this being expected to cost more than the Macquarie Point Stadium, and the costs for which Tasmanian electricity consumers are solely responsible.

On pages 109 and 110: this redacted section which relates to the wholesale energy cost implications on major industrials, which is highly relevant to Tasmania's economic fortunes. 

Page 170 is entirely redacted. No idea what that relates to; a mystery black page. 

Page 236 provides a graph with the cost axis redacted, so we don't know the cost breakdown of the Marinus scenario versus the no-Marinus scenario, and we are then provided the same redacted graphic on page 239. 

Similarly, the project costs for TasNetworks is redacted on page 253 and page 256, along with the details of how much debt TasNetworks will have to take on, which has been blacked out on page 258. 

Tasmanians might be interested to know what the project costs for Hydro will be, as they appear to run into the billions of dollars on page 277. 

It would be good to know what the funding risks are on page 279. 

In fact, so much information about the details of Hydro's profitability under Project Marinus is so redacted that leaves the reader incapable of making any form of assessment.

I could continue, but those are some of the key areas of removed information and detail from the whole-of-state business case, which, understandably, many in the community feel frustrated and insulted by. 

It's also worth noting this parliament has a joint select committee on energy matters, which has been specifically established. The minister mentioned the committee; it was established at the start of the last parliament to scrutinise and report on the Marinus Link proposal. It's yet to release any report, so it may be that that committee does go into more detail here.

When considering the motion before, I asked myself, 'What is of particular relevance or impact from my electorate of Nelson?' I certainly make no claim to be an energy sector expert by any means. There's clear implications and ramifications of this proposal relevant to all Tasmanians no matter where they are. It clearly has statewide significance beyond the immediate region and electorate which may end up bearing the connector and related infrastructure. The rise and fall and rise again, both in the immediate and long-term, of clean renewable energy supply and costs clearly affect all Tasmanians. It will also affect future Tasmanians, and this project is recognised as having profound intergenerational equity implications for Tasmanians on a range of levels. 

However, it's the secrecy and dissembling of the government on Project Marinus at different stages which this motion specifically seeks to tackle. That is why I felt a responsibility on behalf of my electorate of Nelson and those who raised this issue with me to add my voice to this call, especially in light of the final decision-making stages, key components of which occurred contentiously during the recent snap election's caretaker period, as detailed by the honourable member for Mersey.

Also, within the context of promises given and broken, regarding the release of the whole-of-state business case and the timing in which that release was promised to occur 30 days prior to the finalisation of the final investment decision, to reiterate the honourable member for Mersey's statement: if the project is so important and so positive for Tasmania, then what does the government have to hide? Demonstrate the courage of your conviction and release the detail. Provide the report in full along with the cosigned agreement. Only then will the people of Tasmania have an opportunity to examine whether these projects truly stack up and are truly in the best interest of our state. It would go a long way towards restoring a bit of faith and confidence in how the government goes about its decision-making processes.

I also note that at the 11th hour, once again, the government has circulated, just today, further information regarding concerns about releasing this information as requested by the motion, offering yet another confidential briefing. The government is not reading the room; not the room outside of this parliament's closed committee rooms anyway. It has to get better at working out an accountable framework by which the relevant information can be released or communicated more broadly to the community without always relying on locking up the community's elected representatives to give us exclusive privileged information in order to make pesky democratic accountability motions such as the member for Mersey's go away. 

A select few in the know, being slightly more expanded, is a fairly cold comfort for the concerned citizens who also have a right for the greatest degree of transparency possible. It does not help those landowners, for example, affected by the northwest transmission project. It does not help the people in any electorate worried about the long-term ramifications for our robust and affordable energy network. So, I thank the honourable member for Mersey for providing the chamber with the opportunity to require further transparency from the government on Project Marinus and I support his motion.

Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, would it be possible for the honourable member for Murchison to move that the debate stand adjourned? 

Ms Forrest - Do you want me to speak first and then do it? I am not going to be long. It is up to you.

Ms RATTRAY - If it is a short contribution, then that is fine. 

Mr Gaffney - I would take that offer up.

[6.21 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Just for that I'm going to go for an hour and a half.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.1_D=2.6_C=0.48] Mr President, I rise to speak on the motion and with some reservations about supporting it and I will go through my reasons for that.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=65.8_D=23.6_C=0.76] I just want to go back in history a little bit. I think we all remember the commitments made by the government that we all took at face value. You know, the whole-of-state business case would be released to the public 30 days before the feared decision was taken.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=90.2_D=3.1_C=0.74] We all know another early election was called and  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=94.6_D=13.7_C=0.73] that put paid to some of that. I was speaking about a previous committee, even though the committee's been reestablished, but the previous Energy Matters Committee, which there is four members from this House on; prior to the calling of that election that committee was offered a confidential briefing with the then-Treasurer [Bookmark: Phr7_O=110.2_D=11.4_C=0.78]  to go through the report. This is before the decision was taken  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=123.3_D=15.3_C=0.83] and the committee had accepted that opportunity to have that, as the committee is looking at all matters related to energy. It is quite a broad remit, but it does also mention Marinus Link in the terms of reference [Bookmark: Phr9_O=140.0_D=11.1_C=0.85] , which we thought was an appropriate step to take to understand that. Then the committee could have made a determination at that point - not knowing an election was coming down the road like a train [Bookmark: Phr10_O=152.9_D=16.2_C=0.73]  - that we could have made a determination about whether we thought there were aspects of that report that should be made public once we had a chance to understand why confidentiality was being requested over parts of it. 

That opportunity never eventuated. The date was set, the election was called, and the date was beyond the date for the briefing. It was a hearing but in confidence with the committee, never eventuated.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=169.6_D=9.5_C=0.70] I am  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=182.6_D=24.8_C=0.83] conscious that there can be legitimate and genuine commercial sensitivities in some of these documents. I think the government has a pretty poor track record of redacting information to such an extent that one would doubt that could possibly be the case that all is seriously commercially sensitive and that is problematic, and that  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=208.3_D=3.4_C=0.89] undermines public trust and it undermines  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=213.6_D=19.0_C=0.79] the willingness of members of parliament, let alone members of the public, to accept that that document, as heavily redacted as it was eventually when it was released, actually does only redact seriously commercially sensitive information, and herein lies the problem.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=234.6_D=1.9_C=0.85] I doubt  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=237.3_D=8.3_C=0.71] that that actually is the case. 

Ms O'Connor - How would we know? 

Ms FORREST - Yes, well, I am getting to that. Then we had that -  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=247.5_D=15.6_C=0.82] I could use words that are not parliamentary here, Mr President, but I will not.

Mr PRESIDENT - Good.

Ms FORREST - Absolute mess of an arrangement that meant that members had very limited time in a really busy time to look at the unredacted version.  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=264.7_D=11.1_C=0.79] Staff, if they were able to be in that room, had to sign non-disclosure agreements, even though they are bound by the confidentiality of our office.  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=276.9_D=1.1_C=0.83] That aside,  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=279.9_D=7.4_C=0.86] there was one point when members were being asked to sign such a paper. Well, that was where I just about lost the plot completely.  [Bookmark: Phr22_O=288.8_D=13.3_C=0.80] But anyway, that sense was seen around that stupidity and that was not required. But we all had different things on; I was not in Hobart. I got into an office in Burnie where I had [Bookmark: Phr23_O=302.4_D=2.6_C=0.86]  an hour and a half to go through these masses of documents. I didn't know what was going to be released publicly and what wasn't. Then to try and redigest and then recall what was notionally confidential and what wasn't after looking at it and then having it released heavily redacted was impossible. You had the staff member there sitting in the room with you, watching you the whole time. It was very demeaning.

If they really didn't want me to take photos, I could have left my phone out outside, I wouldn't have been popped. But having someone in there sitting there like I was a school child who didn't understand what my role and responsibility is insulting.

No wonder people don't trust the government here, this deficit of trust has been brought on by themselves. That said, once the election was held, the energy committee's been re-established in public accounts committee's been reestablished. As the minister said, the unredacted whole of the state business case was offered to the parliamentary Public Accounts Joint Committee, which I thought was an error in fairness, because the PACs not looking at this. We're looking at lots of other problems in the state. This is just not one of them at the moment. As the minister said the PAC declined that offer because we had no purpose to hold it at that point. We weren't going to be looking into that matter. It would sit there in confidence with no ability that point to actually look at it.

In writing back to the Treasurer, we did point to the fact that there is an energy committee on foot, but that's where it ended at that point. The energy committee then met, and yes, I chair that too, but I don't talk in PAC about what the energy committee is doing, and I don't talk in the energy committee about what the PAC is doing because that's not what you do. The energy committee met and resolved that we think we should have the unredacted version of the whole of state business case, which is what the minister referred to.

The minister and the Treasurer both signed a letter to the energy committee which has been circulated to members of the energy committee, offering that, provided the confidentiality was maintained, which is fine. A parliamentary committee is a committee of the parliament. A parliamentary committee does work on behalf of the parliament. There are two ways this can be dealt with. The committee hasn't had a chance to meet to discuss what they will do with that, but assuming that a committee would accept such a document, particularly as we've requested it, one would think the committee would do the work on behalf of the of the parliament.

The fact that I'm on the committee is irrelevant to this point. If that committee felt that there was information that had been redacted that really was in the public interest and wasn't commercially sensitive and should be released, well, the committee would report that to the parliament. The parliament could then make a determination and perhaps order the release of other parts of it. The other option is - and this is why I'm not willing to support the motion at this point - is that every member of this House could be provided with a briefing - it would probably be good to have it all together rather than one at a time - to have the minister and Treasurer go through that report and highlight the redacted bits.

We all know how to maintain confidentiality, otherwise we shouldn't be here, and they could then explain to the members exactly why each part is sensitive and why it shouldn't be released? Because I believe there are probably some legitimate numbers in that that could, if released, compromise one of the owners which is us, the people of Tasmania, the people of Victoria and the people of Australia - because it's the federal government, or a government business that sits underneath it.

I don't believe that, and the member for Nelson referred to this, the massively redacted sections should all be redacted. Personally, I haven't had a chance to understand what's under those, but I think we do need to understand. If he demanded today to release it here and now, which if the minister and Treasurer didn't do it, would really be ignoring the will of the House. I think we run the risk of actually exposing things that we haven't had a chance to fully consider should they or shouldn't they be released. I absolutely understand the call for it, and I respect that call. I think the government's handled this fairly untidily, but I do think we run the risk of potentially, inadvertently, revealing sensitive information that could negatively impact one or all of the owners or businesses, of some who have data in that report.

Mr Gaffney - Can I ask the question because I won't be able to when you sit down?

Ms FORREST - Sure.

Mr Gaffney - I want to understand the relationship between [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.4_D=3.8_C=0.57]  the Energy Committee and the government report. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=35.0_D=26.0_C=0.76]  If you came back and said that you should be able to unredact all these bits, does the government have to, or can they say, no, we're not going to do that.

Ms FORREST - In my view, and I haven't had any advice from the Clerks on this, but I imagine that it would need to come back to the House to make that determination because the committee acts on behalf of parliament. It is not the parliament itself. If you're wanting to do something [Bookmark: Phr4_O=61.7_D=1.0_C=0.93]  as significant as that [Bookmark: Phr5_O=63.1_D=10.4_C=0.81] , I expect the committee would report to the parliament. As a member of a committee, that's what I would expect to happen. For a committee to demand that [Bookmark: Phr6_O=75.0_D=2.6_C=0.74]  a document that the parliament has an interest in,  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=78.3_D=26.8_C=0.76] it may need to come back to the parliament, so it should be a vote of the parliament, I would have thought. There may be other ways, but that's me thinking about what I would expect. If I wasn't on the committee, I would expect that. Does that answer the question?

Mr Gaffney - There has to be a pathway from the committee if they're going to look at that issue and they come back and say, 'Well, we don't think these pages should be out there [Bookmark: Phr8_O=106.0_D=2.6_C=0.63] '. Whether the government has that decision, or whether it comes back to the parliament [Bookmark: Phr9_O=109.2_D=15.6_C=0.72] , I'm quite comfortable.

Ms FORREST - Either way the the committee or members of parliament would need to have a pretty clear and open and frank discussion, briefing, meeting with the relevant ministers to be assured that this should be [Bookmark: Phr10_O=124.8_D=11.3_C=0.75]  redacted and why. In the absence of that, we don't have that now, I'm reluctant to support the motion because of that.

Mr Duigan - Noting the relevant ministers have no hand in any of the redactions.

Ms FORREST - [Bookmark: Phr11_O=136.9_D=20.4_C=0.57]  Correct. Then maybe we need to talk to Hydro.

Mr Duigan - For the whole state business case, Treasury.

Ms O'Connor - State Growth.

Mr Duigan - Treasury.

Ms FORREST - ReCFIT did it.

Mr Duigan - No, Treasury. In the whole of state business case?

Ms FORREST - Yes.

Mr Duigan - Treasury. In the FIT assessment document, ReCFIT.

Ms FORREST - The whole-of-state business case was Treasury?

Mr Duigan - The whole-of-state business case was Treasury.

Mr PRESIDENT - Order.

Ms FORREST - Maybe Treasury.  Whoever it was [Bookmark: Phr12_O=158.2_D=18.7_C=0.65]  that decided this should be redacted should be called to appear before the Energy Committee in the first instance and/or members of parliament to [Bookmark: Phr13_O=177.9_D=15.3_C=0.77]  assist members to understand the rationale regarding the extent of redaction. I understand that some of the information relates to Hydro-sensitive matters, so Hydro may need to be part of that discussion [Bookmark: Phr14_O=193.3_D=4.0_C=0.75] . That's a matter for the individual members to determine or the committee. That is the way I see it anyway.
 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=198.2_D=2.1_C=0.41]  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=206.1_D=27.3_C=0.72] 
One other point I want to raise, and the member for Nelson talked about the North West Transmission Developments and the link to Marinus. Part of the North West Transmission Developments has to be built anyway. It needs that strengthening of this northern section I'm talking about. Yes, the credit rating downgrade will affect future borrowings for that project as every other borrowing in this state will be impacted quite negatively and should not be [Bookmark: Phr18_O=233.7_D=24.2_C=0.77]  underestimated like the Treasurer seems want to do. It is a very real issue and will have very real impact. I note that the northern corridor upgrade is a critical and essential piece of work anyway. It's the link between Burnie and Hampshire. The southern part that's also part of the Marinus Link [Bookmark: Phr19_O=258.7_D=4.4_C=0.74] , is a new piece of work that [Bookmark: Phr20_O=264.1_D=12.7_C=0.75]  has direct implications. The southern part of that loop is related to the second link of Marinus.

 [Bookmark: Phr21_O=277.5_D=16.4_C=0.81] I've tried to make the point as to why. I understand the member's call. I can't support it at this point in time. There may be a time when it does need to be, perhaps not completely, but certainly a lot of it provided publicly to give some public assurance and comfort about [Bookmark: Phr22_O=294.2_D=1.4_C=0.76]  the decisions being made. [Bookmark: Phr23_O=297.5_D=7.3_C=0.78]  I acknowledge the trust deficit in the government and the heavy redactions of other documents. That does make people question what's actually being hidden from them.

I believe if you're going to use redactions, be really sure that you're not redacting things that are a bit uncomfortable or a bit inconvenient for the government, but things that are truly sensitive that could negatively impact on a party or parties to the arrangement, the deal, the contract, whatever it relates to, so that you're only redacting critically essential information, not just bits that seem to be a bit - perhaps we just don't really want people to know that, it's just a bit embarrassing, it's not really convenient or people might draw weird conclusions from that. It's up to the government to ensure that the information is put out in such a way that people can understand it and it is only truly sensitive information that is redacted. 

I hope I've made my position clear on that for the member for Mersey. I understand the reason he brings this here, and I commend him for that, but I won't support it.

I'm happy to move -

That the debate stand adjourned.

Debate adjourned.


SUSPENSION OF SITTING

[6.36 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move -

That the sitting be suspended until the ringing of the division bells

This is for the purpose of a dinner break.

The sitting was suspended from 6.36 p.m. to 7.45 p.m. 


MOTION

Project Marinus Whole-of-State Business Case and Federal Government Agreement

Resumed from above (page xx).

Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, I have nothing further to add to my stellar contribution from earlier.

[7.46 p.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - Mr President, thank you. I thank the minister and I thank the honourable member for Nelson and the honourable member for Montgomery for participating in the debate. To add to this, it is greatly disappointing that the government does not intend to support this motion. The government had a valuable opportunity to demonstrate to the Tasmanian people that they are indeed committed to transparency and genuine democracy. Instead, the government has chosen secrecy.

The people have made it clear that the information pertaining to Marinus which the government has provided so far is insufficient in order to secure widespread support and social licence for the project. Serious unanswered questions remain, both in relation to the whole-of-state business case and to the Marinus agreement signed with the federal government. It was interesting to note - and I note the comments from the minister and take those on board - that in most reports that we get, you get recommendations and then when you see the recommendations, you can go to the evidence and see how those recommendations come about. 

In this situation none of the recommendations has been redacted, but a lot of the evidence is not visible to people, so the recommendation could just be an interpretation of what's been covered by black ink. That doesn't create comfort and doesn't create security in the public when they are not able to see how that recommendation has come about. I thank the member for Nelson who highlighted through her speech the number of pages and the amount of information that had been covered over. I also acknowledge the member for Murchison when she spoke about the need to be careful in case there is something that needs to be redacted. 

I'm kind of comforted by the fact now that it looks as though it will go through the Energy Matters Committee. I'd be interested to know from the minister the dates of those requests. Did those requests come before 4 November when this was tabled, or did they come after 4 November when this was tabled? Is the offering to send it off to the energy committee because of this question on the books, or was it something that was going to happen anyway? I find that - I think I might ask that - 

Mr Duigan - Through you, Mr President. Certainly, the offer to PAC was made much earlier.

Mr GAFFNEY - And the offer - 

Mr Duigan - Well, that was a bit of a process. It was offered and then was rejected and then - I'm not quite sure when. 

Ms Forrest - Just for the members' benefit, just checking which hat I was wearing. We wrote to the Treasurer in the middle of November asking for it, and the letter that we've got is not dated. 

Mr GAFFNEY - My notice of motion was tabled on 4 November. 

Ms Forrest - Oh, was it?

Mr GAFFNEY - Yes. I would suggest that I believe it was 4 November, if somebody could have a look at that.

Ms Forrest - The minister's right, we did - it was offered to PAC some time ago.

Ms Rattray - It was 4 November, honourable member.

Ms Forrest - So it was offered to PAC in October.

Mr GAFFNEY - Offered to PAC in October, and therefore the response from it has been pushed along by the fact that this was tabled on 4 November. I'm quite comfortable with that. I will probably ask some questions, on notice or without notice, about what guarantee - if the recommendation comes back from the energy committee that this should be unredacted and open to the public - what commitment there is from the Treasurer or the minister that would take place. I can also understand and appreciate if some of the information contained in the report needs to be redacted. That's fine.

The Tasmanian government - to me - has not made a convincing case that the heavy degree which the Marinus business case was redacted was truly necessary and justified in order to protect confidential commercial information.

Additionally, the offer to provide the requested documents only to the Public Accounts and the Energy Matters committees and interested Legislative Council members on condition of confidentialities is not an adequate substitute for proper public scrutiny and will merely repeat the mistakes and unfortunate charade that took place during the caretaking period when the government gave a similar confidential briefing. It was grossly inadequate as the member from Murchison had mentioned when she had a limited time to go in there and will be again for the same reason.

The thing that worries me about the organisations - Hydro or whatever - saying, 'go away, redact', bureaucrats are by nature conservative. They don't want to put information out there that may be questioned. Therefore, the public won't get a very good report that they can go, 'okay, we understand where that recommendation comes from because we can see the flow of information' because somewhere someone is saying, 'well, we better not do that, we better hide that just in case that comes back to bite us'.

I asked the government to reconsider and to support the Marinus motion after all; otherwise there is a risk of losing not only what remains of public confidence in Project Marinus but also in the Tasmanian government itself. I do appreciate the comments and the feedback I've had from members of this House. I move the motion stand in my name.

MOTION

Committee of the Whole Council to consider the State Policies and Projects (Macquarie Point Precinct) Order 2025 (No 49)

[7.57 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, I move - 

That the Legislative Council:

Notes on 21 October 2025 the Governor made the State Policies and Projects (Macquarie Point Precinct) Order 2025 (No. 49) (the Order).

Further notes that under section 26(9) of the State Polices and Projects Act 1993 the Order does not have effect until it is approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.

Resolves that upon any Motion being moved, and Question proposed, that the Council approve the Order (the Motion), so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent:
		upon Debate being closed on the Question proposed by the Motion, but

		before the President puts that Question to the Council, the Council resolving itself into a Committee of the Whole Council for the purpose of considering the Order, and

Empowers that Committee of the Whole Council to consider each Clause, Schedule and Item of the State Policies and Projects (Macquarie Point Precinct) Order 2025 (No. 49) in the following manner:

		the Chair is to call on each Clause, Schedule or Item, and ask if any Member has any question thereon, and

		if no questions are asked, or a question or questions having been asked, no further questions are asked, the Chair shall declare that the Clause, Schedule or Item has been considered,

		the Report of the Committee of the Whole Council be limited to ‘the Committee has considered the State Policies and Projects (Macquarie Point Precinct) Order 2025 (No. 49)’, and

		for the avoidance of doubt, the Committee of the Whole Council is not empowered to amend any Clause, Schedule or Item of the State Policies and Projects (Macquarie Point Precinct) Order 2025 (No. 49).

Further resolves that upon the Report of the Committee of the Whole Council being brought up, the President shall immediately, or at such future time as Ordered by the Council, put the Question proposed by the Motion.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=187.0_D=21.2_C=0.80] Mr President, I do not intend to speak for too long on this motion but I think it may be important to step through the process and there has been a few questions asked about that. For those people who may be watching, to understand what this motion seeks to achieve: all of us know over the next two days we will be dealing with the order related to the Macquarie Point Stadium and that is quite a dense and complex document. Because it is an order there is only one vote that can be taken, so every member will have the opportunity to express their thoughts on the order itself, so basically in favour or not of the order, but before you Mr President put the vote after everyone to have the opportunity to speak and the member in charge of the order has the chance to reply to the debate. Once that has occurred, the way this will work is the relevant standing order will be suspended to enable you to move a motion that would enable the House to resolve itself into a committee to consider the order clause-by-clause or section-by-section or item-by-item.  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=263.7_D=28.8_C=0.77] 

That is how the wording of the motion there before you outlines. In that process, it will be a similar process as when we're in the committee stage of a bill and the Deputy Clerk will call each clause or schedule or item and every member will have the opportunity for three questions on that. I will talk more about this if this is approved and we get into that committee-like stage.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=293.2_D=11.7_C=0.73] There is just for questions. It's not for re prosecuting the argument of whether we should or should not support the order. It is just to clarify matters in the order related to particular questions on each section. Because we don't have an opportunity to do that without this motion, if we don't support this motion - and that's up to the House, of course - it means that if any members have got questions about the operation of the order or various sections in the order or schedules in the order, they will have to put all their questions in their contribution on the order and it will be up to the leader of the motion to approve the order to be able to respond to all of those questions in one hit without any further clarifying questions. 

This will make it a longer process if it is supported. I would hope that members would consider, if they support this, that they consider their contribution on the principal question of whether the order should be agreed to or not, and then questions be focused in that committee-like stage to enable thorough scrutiny of the order. 

Once we've been through that process, there won't be a question put that the item be agreed to or anything like that; whoever is in the chair will make the declaration that the clause, the schedule or the item has been considered and there won't be a question put. At the end, I will report to you, Mr President - or the Chair will report to you - that the order has been considered, at which time the President will resume his Chair and then put the vote, the one and only vote, on the order itself.

I hope that's clear. If any members have questions, you're quite free to speak on it and I will try to respond to those in my summing up on this. That's the purpose of it. It's not to slow the process down; it's to hopefully make it more rigorous and more like contemporary scrutiny. As we go through, it's easier to ask questions as they relate to a particular provision and move through it that way so that every member has the opportunity to ask questions related to how the order will work in relation to the various parts of that. 

I put that motion. I'm happy to respond to any questions. 

Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, thank you. I advised to make a brief contribution on this motion which I will be supporting. First, I wish to acknowledge and thank the honourable member for Murchison for bringing this motion to us. It's a clear mechanism for the Chamber to consider. 

Democratic debate is a fundamental principle of any parliament worthy of its name; but democratic debate does not just concern the nature of the debate underway, it is the capacity to even hold a thorough debate on a matter of interest in the first place. That's the significant contribution which this motion makes: it provides a clear and transparent mechanism by which one of the most controversial matters to come before this parliament, I would say, can be considered thoroughly by this Chamber. 

We all know the nature of the statutory instrument, the State Policies and Projects (Macquarie Point Precinct) Order 2025, does not allow for amendment as if it were a bill, but it certainly warrants as thorough an examination as legislation would be awarded.

It's also important that the Legislative Council does uphold the principles of detailed scrutiny as provided for by the framework detailed in the motion: the capacity to consider each clause, schedule and item of the order. Not every clause, schedule or item may require detailed scrutiny, but it is responsible, right and proper for this place to reserve that right and capacity to do so; particularly in light of the fact that the debate limitations which are established under the standing orders of the other place resulted in that debate held on Thursday 13 November, only taking a total of 6.8 hours from 2.44 p.m. to 9.25 p.m. That's 6.8 hours in a Chamber of 35 members on a matter of such intense public interest. That's an observation, not a reflection on the other place, as each Chamber is a master of its own destiny, which I recognise, but I'm just noting it.

We shouldn't seek to make it a competition regarding the length or brevity of debates. We have different roles in the Chambers but, put simply, the order consists of 157 pages. It's a significant statutory instrument and one which will have considerable implications for current and future generations. It was that gravitas and statewide consequence which was used as a rationale in declaring the proposed Macquarie Point stadium a Project of State Significance in the first place and, as such, it deserves and warrants that it is provided the most rigorous and informed scrutiny possible through this place.

This Chamber, as we are occasionally reminded, is the House of review, and this motion is consistent with and delivers on the most important principles of rigorous democratic review and debate in the public interest. 

I support the motion.

[8.05 p.m.]
Mr EDMUNDS (Pembroke) -  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=10.7_D=4.6_C=0.85] Mr President, thank you to the mover of this motion, which [Bookmark: Phr4_O=17.1_D=1.9_C=0.78]  my colleague from Rumney and I will support. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=23.4_D=23.3_C=0.76]  It hasn't taken long to forget what we talked about today; has it Mr President and I can't wait for tomorrow?

Ms O'Connor - Do you think it's disrespectful just to exclaim?

Mr EDMUNDS - Yes. You get your chance to speak and I will not interrupt you like I didn't interrupt you earlier today.

Ms O'Connor - You can interrupt me anytime.

Mr EDMUNDS - I don't want to interrupt you because I respect your contribution.

Mr PRESIDENT - Order. I won't get into a debate across the Chamber. Let's try to keep it respectful.

Mr EDMUNDS - I have the badge on.

Ms O'Connor - [Bookmark: Phr6_O=48.2_D=0.4_C=0.08]  I just exclaimed. You're sensitive.

Ms Thomas - That's disrespectful.

 Mr PRESIDENT -  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=54.8_D=2.3_C=0.74] It won't be tolerated tomorrow.

Mr EDMUNDS -  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=58.0_D=1.0_C=0.70] Thank you. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=59.4_D=13.0_C=0.79]  As throughout, we support extra scrutiny, as we have throughout this process. I am a supporter of this project, and I welcome this line-by-line analysis - s [Bookmark: Phr10_O=73.3_D=4.6_C=0.93] crutiny and getting things on the record to provide comfort to members [Bookmark: Phr11_O=81.1_D=3.5_C=0.86]  as I believe that is the best pathway forward for its support. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=86.6_D=2.0_C=0.89] 

I do not think that this is a filibuster. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=89.3_D=6.8_C=0.79]  However, if it turns into one, I will not support any adjournment, and I've already spoken to the mover, and I believe they are of the same opinion.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=100.0_D=3.2_C=0.88] This is a vote and a job for this week [Bookmark: Phr15_O=104.1_D=3.2_C=0.90]  and I'm sure the Chair will do that role appropriately. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=107.9_D=8.5_C=0.75]  I look forward to her comments in reply and a respectful debate throughout.

[8.07 p.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) -  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=119.8_D=25.2_C=0.87] I might seek some advice from you after the sitting about whether it is unparliamentary simply to exclaim in surprise. The reason I was surprised is because in the House of Assembly, when the Greens put an identical motion to this one up, it was not supported by government or Labor members [Bookmark: Phr18_O=145.8_D=25.0_C=0.86] . That is something that the Council should be reminded of because when we are told in this place by certain members that they support extra scrutiny on this project, that needs to be backed up by actions. I note that all during Estimates we didn't hear a single question from Labor across four Estimates committees on the stadium.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=171.6_D=6.6_C=0.81] I also note that when the Tasmanian Planning Commission came to present to us [Bookmark: Phr20_O=178.9_D=9.4_C=0.89]  at the hearing last Thursday, we had questions from Labor about themselves at the beginning of the hearing and nothing for the rest of the four hours [Bookmark: Phr21_O=189.8_D=0.6_C=0.77]  [Bookmark: Phr22_O=191.8_D=3.2_C=0.89] , so anyone can stand up here and say anything. [Bookmark: Phr23_O=195.6_D=7.3_C=0.86]  You can say you support extra scrutiny, but your actions speak for themselves.

 [Bookmark: Phr24_O=203.9_D=6.9_C=0.85] I appreciate the member for Murchison's initiative [Bookmark: Phr25_O=211.8_D=8.8_C=0.90]  in bringing forward this opportunity for the Legislative Council to go through the stadium order clause by clause [Bookmark: Phr26_O=221.3_D=7.6_C=0.70] , weak provision by weak provision, flimsy condition by flimsy condition. [Bookmark: Phr27_O=229.9_D=4.6_C=0.88]  Personally, given what our community has been through for the last three years [Bookmark: Phr28_O=235.1_D=4.8_C=0.81] , the division, the conflict, the dishonesty [Bookmark: Phr29_O=240.8_D=3.9_C=0.82] , I would rather that this order was euthanised quickly [Bookmark: Phr30_O=245.7_D=2.5_C=0.88] , but as I said at the rally [Bookmark: Phr31_O=248.7_D=11.3_C=0.89]  last Saturday, and I said it with enormous pride, on this issue as on every issue, the Legislative Council will do the work [Bookmark: Phr32_O=260.7_D=6.2_C=0.87]  and it is manifest in this motion put forward by the member for Murchison.
 [Bookmark: Phr33_O=267.5_D=10.1_C=0.91] 
We have a job to do to go through this order, and I believe it will be exposed for the sham that it is [Bookmark: Phr34_O=278.3_D=9.5_C=0.82] . I draw members' attention to how similar, almost identical; this final order [Bookmark: Phr35_O=288.5_D=12.5_C=0.91]  looks to the draft order that came out a few weeks before that and how near identical it is to the enabling legislation and the provisions within that legislation.
 [Bookmark: Phr36_O=301.8_D=1.0_C=0.92]  [Bookmark: Phr37_O=303.6_D=1.4_C=0.63] 
Ever since the Tasmanian Planning Commission, after a year of gathering evidence and assessment, came back and said the parliament should not support this stadium, we've been subject to a government making it up as it goes along, whether it was the enabling bill which came out after the draft integrated assessment report, or this final order that's before us.

We'll be dealing with an order, to be really clear, where the government is the proponent, the developer and the regulator. I know that all members are being flooded with emails. I haven't counted them yet, but overwhelmingly they are in strong opposition to this project.

I'm certain that those people we represent will be glad to know, should this motion pass, that we're putting the time in to better understanding the order. I absolutely believe that for any member who hasn't made up their mind at this point - and how could you not, but there would be people who are still weighing it because it's such a huge decision - I believe that closer scrutiny of this order will help all of us more clearly understand the risks that we would be embarking on should the order itself be approved, because it does not address all the matters that were raised as problematic by the Tasmanian Planning Commission.

It doesn't go anywhere near close enough to addressing the environmental issues. The fact that, as we established in Estimates, there are 220,000 cubic metres of contaminated soil under the footprint of the stadium. It doesn't deal with the RSL Tasmania's heartfelt plea to us to reject the stadium order because it is immoral.

Well, in all likelihood tomorrow we'll have an opportunity to closely examine this immoral order. I trust it will be exposed for the high-risk scenario it presents us with.

Mr PRESIDENT - Just before I call the next, just to clear up a couple of things. We're different to the House of Assembly; we're a House of review and our job is to scrutinise, and we can't impute motives by any other member. We in this Chamber regulate our own conduct and a lot of members feel and think differently about things. We as individual members have to honour and respect that if a member feels uncomfortable, they have a right to say that. If someone feels uncomfortable, you have a right to say that.

There's a lot of aggression in the community about this topic, but we can't have it in this Chamber. We've just got to stay as respectful as we can, even if we don't agree with other members. The question is the motion be agreed to.

Ms WEBB - Point of order on that. May I clarify something in that statement with you?

Mr PRESIDENT - Certainly.

Ms WEBB - In this Chamber, though, we can make factual statements, I presume which may involve making a factual statement about a position or something that has been put into the public domain particularly by, say, a party of this parliament and that should be utterly unremarkable that we might do that.

I don't think there can be such a sensitivity that we can't make a factual statement about something, surely. I'm just trying to clarify here the degree to which you're constraining the things that we might say here, because I presume it doesn't relate to describing the way a party has voted or a particular statement that is factually said in the public domain.

Mr PRESIDENT - No, it's certainly not constraining debate. I'm just asking that members are respectful of that and even if someone's getting up to speak and they're trying to find their feet and little comments from the side don't help. Facts are always welcome. If you've got facts and they are facts, then that's the way we debate things here. It's got to be factual and if you're going to put that out, then you've got to be prepared to accept it back. I'm not constraining any debate, but I'm just asking that we do it in a way that is respectful and understanding of how comments from all members may affect other members. That's all I'm asking for.

Ms O'CONNOR - Mr President, point of order: thank you for your guidance and your ruling - 

Ms Forrest - What's the order?

Ms Thomas - What's the point of order?

Ms O'CONNOR - Well, the point of order is I just want to refute any allegation - 

Ms Thomas - Which number?

Ms O'CONNOR - Well, hang on. 

Mr PRESIDENT - Order.

Ms O'CONNOR - I just want to refute any assertion that I've been aggressive.

Mr Duigan - But is it a point of order?

Ms Thomas - This is out of order.

[8.15 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President. I'd like to be thankful for this opportunity to provide a contribution on this motion. As a House of review, I believe all members recognise that this process, as outlined by the member for Murchison in the motion before us, would provide an opportunity for additional scrutiny. The Premier has stated scrutiny is welcome; additional questions and further information will make for a better project. I've just got two or three points around the process that I wanted to make on behalf of the government.

The project has been a continual debate since it was first announced in 2023; certainly that's evident. It's taken such a while to get here, and it's also taken two state elections, and it's been considered by the Public Accounts Committee in an inquiry that ran for over two years. It's been through the POSS process, which included extensive public consultation, stakeholder consultation and public hearings with the submission of over 5000 pages of detailed plans and information, all published and publicly available. 

It has been discussed and debated extensively in the parliament by both Houses. There have been numerous motions, questions and Estimates hearings, and now it's currently being considered by the parliament at the final stage in the planning assessment process. We know that members have sat through hours of briefings and discussions on the topic of the proposed stadium, and this included a select committee where members were afforded the opportunity to directly question those who were members of the TPC panel. Every member in this place will have an opportunity to provide their contribution on the POSS debate, and every member who chooses to speak on the substantive debate will have an opportunity to put their views on the stadium and make them clear. 

There is an opportunity through this process, should it pass, to put further questions on the record through their contributions and for the government's response to likewise be put on the record through the summing up. The government has welcomed scrutiny or examination on the merits of the multipurpose stadium and, as I have already stated, it is a House of review, and as the Premier stated, scrutiny is welcomed, and I look forward to starting tomorrow.

[8.19 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, I thank the honourable members for their contributions and support of this. I think it will give us a chance to operate in our best way that we can as a House of review, and a House focused on scrutiny of government actions. I just want to make a couple of comments in closing: particularly, I made some public comments today when I spoke to Leon Compton on ABC Mornings and again, I spoke to the media at lunchtime. I've got no idea what they reported because I've been in here. I made the point that a lot of pressure has been put on a lot of members. Some of us have been here a long time and this is the worst I've ever found it [Bookmark: Phr2_O=8.0_D=0.6_C=0.81]  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=9.8_D=18.5_C=0.77] . Maybe it's pure coincidence, but since those comments have been made, people have toned down some of their rhetoric, some of the comments. I have had a number of really nice messages. My EA, Yvonne, reported some nice phone calls to my office [Bookmark: Phr4_O=29.2_D=13.9_C=0.84]  acknowledging that whatever decision I make, and I'm sure it applies to most people in this House, the community will respect the decision. I hope that's the case for everyone, because this is not an easy decision [Bookmark: Phr5_O=43.9_D=2.2_C=0.87]  and it does require thorough scrutiny.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=46.7_D=18.8_C=0.81] I thought if I've been here for over 20 years, and for me, this is the worst time I have had in this place, I can only imagine how difficult and challenging it must be for some of the less experienced members in this place. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=66.3_D=18.8_C=0.77]  I want to put on the record and why - and I reiterate your points, Mr President, we need to be respectful and to allow people to hold their views respectfully. I have the standing orders over there because I wanted to just refer to Standing Order 99(5). Standing Order 99 refers to what a member shall not do in the course of a debate, a [Bookmark: Phr8_O=85.8_D=8.4_C=0.67]  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=95.7_D=28.4_C=0.80] nd that's only part of the debate, whether it's the substantive question or whether it's during the so-called Committee stage of this process. And it says: (tbc)

A Member shall not in the course of debate - 

Comment on expressions by other Members

(5) digress from the subject matter under discussion or comment upon expressions used by any other member in a previous Debate. All imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections are disorderly. 

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=124.4_D=6.8_C=0.85] It's pretty clear to me that even if I disagree, and I will disagree with some people in this House [Bookmark: Phr11_O=131.9_D=17.9_C=0.86] , I absolutely will, but I won't reflect on them and I won't impute improper motives. They're entitled to their view, they're entitled to their position and I hope that we can hold this debate over the next two days - it won't be easy - respectfully [Bookmark: Phr12_O=151.3_D=9.1_C=0.85]  and giving everyone the time to get their thoughts together when they get to the their feet and not to be interrupted [Bookmark: Phr13_O=161.1_D=14.0_C=0.79] , other than perhaps to seek clarification on a point or something like that. I hope we don't have any imputation of improper motives or anything like that, because everyone is entitled to make their contribution in here. If you don't want to listen, go out. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=175.9_D=5.9_C=0.76]  I thank members for their contribution on this motion and their support.

Motion agreed to.


MOTION

Report of the Auditor-General No. 3 of 2025-26: Proposed Sale of Wilkinsons Point Land - Consideration and Noting

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=183.5_D=10.7_C=0.80] [8.23 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) -  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=194.8_D=11.4_C=0.85]  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=217.6_D=26.2_C=0.78] Mr. President, I know it's getting late. I do have a relatively short contribution on this motion, but because this is our last private members opportunity for the year, it's important we move these motions that are relevant to the current circumstances. I'm sure all members have read the Auditor-General's report into the proposed sale of Wilkinsons Point land. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=245.2_D=0.6_C=0.90]  It is a matter [Bookmark: Phr20_O=246.1_D=29.9_C=0.74]  that's also before the Public Accounts Committee. I'm not going to reflect on the work of the Public Accounts Committee; I'm entirely focused on the report of the Auditor-General. I thank the Auditor-General for his work. He's done a power of work in his office in recent times and really helped to shine a light on some of the failings and failures of governance and process in this state. 

In moving this motion, I wish to address what is [Bookmark: Phr21_O=276.4_D=1.6_C=0.71]  a matter of serious public concern [Bookmark: Phr22_O=279.0_D=16.8_C=0.85] . This is not simply another routine audit report; in fact, as the Auditor-General has said himself, this was an additional performance audit that was conducted after there was more than one, I believe, referral to his office to consider it. [Bookmark: Phr23_O=296.9_D=8.1_C=0.74]  As with all our referrals, whether they come from member of parliament, a member of the Public Accounts Committee, the Tasmanian Audit Office do an assessment and determine whether there's something that should be looked at and whether it should be looked at that time. Obviously there was enough concern raised in the references that he received that he did undertake a review or an audit. 

This is actually a damning indictment of how our public institutions have managed a significant transaction involving publicly-owned land, taxpayer funds and the public interest. I know the member for Elwick, also a member of the PAC, will have a lot more to say in this because this is her backyard and she absolutely understands this probably better than anyone else in this Chamber.

The Auditor-General's findings and conclusion could not be clearer. The Department of State Growth's processes from 2019 to 2025 were inadequate. These processes did not support the identification and effective management of risks associated with the land-sale process and, remarkably, as of September 2025, six years after negotiations commenced, the land-sale process was still not complete.

To be clear about what inadequate means in this context, the Auditor-General found:

First, there was no business case or implementation plan. You wonder how that could happen. Despite the complexity of this proposal involving a basketball team, an entertainment centre upgrade and a significant land transaction, state entities proceeded without the fundamental framework needed to manage the uncertainty, coordinate efforts, and achieve the intended outcomes.

Second, governance arrangements were fundamentally flawed. A steering committee wasn't even established until 17 months after the decision to negotiate. Advice was reactive rather than proactive, with papers marked 'urgent' and 'super urgent'. I mean, surely it's urgent or it's not? Creating an atmosphere where proper due diligence was sacrificed for perceived expediency.

Third, advice to government was insufficient. The Auditor-General found that advice did not clearly identify essential issues, options from implementation, or key risks. This is a fundamental failure of the public service's duty to provide frank, comprehensive and timely advice.

If that's not bad enough, the problems went deeper still. A non-binding sale price of $6 million was publicly released in December 2020, before appropriate valuation processes had been concluded. This is not standard practice. It establishes a reference point that can influence future decisions and negotiations. I think most of us would recognise that is just something that should not have happened. 

Conflicts of interest were not properly managed. They weren't even a standing item in the steering committee meetings until April 2024, five years into the process. The Valuer-General was asked to set a reserve price prematurely based on the draft subdivision plan without being clearly informed a significant change to the plan might alter the market value. Perhaps, most troublingly, a valuation report was shared with the proponent against the explicit advice of the Valuer-General, on the instruction of the Premier's office staff, who, as the Auditor-General notes, are not delegated under legislation to direct public servants to take such actions.

The Auditor-General's report speaks of significant shortcomings in advice and process and failures that state entities must address to maintain public trust. These are not mere administrative quibbles; these are fundamental breakdowns in how the government is supposed to work. 

Over six years, the nature of this proposal has fundamentally changed. What began as a unique unsolicited proposal involving a basketball team, entertainment centre upgrade and sporting facilities all at Wilkinsons Point has morphed into something quite different. The community sports facility moved to another part of Glenorchy. The high-performance facility relocated to Kingston. The uniqueness that justified avoiding an open-market process has fallen away, in the Auditor-General's words.

Yet, throughout these changes, state entities and departmental officials appear to have failed to step back and ask the fundamental questions. Are these remaining works still in Tasmania's interest? That advice wasn't provided until July 2025, six years after the progress had begun.

The Auditor-General has provided 4 clear recommendations:

That the Department of Premier and Cabinet establish protocols to ensure state entities work with ministers in accordance with State Service principles;

That State Growth ensures it provides comprehensive advice on costs, benefit and risks before substantially implementing government commitments

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=6.1_D=6.2_C=0.74] That State Growth develops a framework to reduce risks in transactions of this nature [Bookmark: Phr3_O=12.8_D=4.2_C=0.57] ; and

That State Growth updates its conflicts of interest policy.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=18.3_D=18.8_C=0.81] Mr President, these recommendations have been accepted and I note the response from the Department of State Growth acknowledging improvements since mid 2024, but we must ask, why did it take an Auditor-General's investigation to prompt these basic improvements? This should be good-practice. This should be what was going on anyway, but it was not.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=37.5_D=1.0_C=0.95]  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=39.8_D=22.8_C=0.74] I must also note a serious concern raised by the Auditor-General himself. He was restricted from accessing Cabinet documents, preventing him from assessing whether State Growth's implementation was consistent with Cabinet parameters. As the Auditor-General states, this restriction means such investigations not being able to provide a full picture to the Tasmanian parliament. This is unacceptable.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=63.6_D=10.2_C=0.81] Parliament and the public deserve a complete picture when public resources and public land are involved. The Audit Act, in my view, and that of others, is clear on this matter [Bookmark: Phr8_O=74.9_D=2.5_C=0.81] , and the Auditor-General sought advice on this matter, but  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=79.1_D=5.1_C=0.86] if it does need to be strengthened further to make it absolutely clear to avoid future issues,  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=85.5_D=15.3_C=0.85] the current review of the Audit Act must clarify this matter. It is being reviewed at the moment, seems to have stalled since the election, but the Auditor-General must have access to Cabinet documents.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=102.2_D=5.5_C=0.83] He knows how to deal with confidential matters. It is an insult to suggest that that would be otherwise.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=108.8_D=28.4_C=0.78] Mr President, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge what the Auditor-General himself notes in his Forward, that the creation of the JackJumpers has been a remarkable success and that is absolutely the case. The teams achievements since 2021-22 NBL season speak for themselves. They are having a bit of a not-so-good patch right now but they have had great success. It has created jobs, voluntary opportunities and increased basketball participation.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=137.8_D=14.4_C=0.71] But as the Auditor-General wisely observes, when our state entities use appropriate processes to support and implement government decisions, they not only manage risk but ensure positive outcomes to Tasmania so it then receives appropriate recognition.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=153.2_D=3.0_C=0.51]  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=157.3_D=26.2_C=0.68] This has not occurred in relation to the proposed sale of Wilkinsons Point land. That is how it should be. It is not how it was handled on this occasion. The success of the JackJumpers does not excuse the process failures. Good outcomes achieved through poor processes are still failures of governance, and poor processes create risks, risks to taxpayer funds, risks to public assets and risks to public trust.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=184.0_D=2.5_C=0.80] I know other members will have comments to make on this matter [Bookmark: Phr17_O=186.8_D=14.4_C=0.74]  who have raised concerns regarding this matter and, as I said, the PAC also has a matter before it related to this this matter. We were waiting for the Auditor-General to complete his work when we became aware that he was looking at that.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=202.3_D=15.6_C=0.81] This report should serve as a wakeup call. It demonstrates what happens when basic principles of public administration are set aside, when business cases are not prepared, when conflicts are not managed, when advice is not comprehensive,  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=218.5_D=14.0_C=0.76] when professional advice is overridden without proper authority. The people of Tasmania deserve better than this; they deserve a state service that follows proper process, provides frank and fearless advice,  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=232.6_D=24.5_C=0.77] and managers public assets with care and diligence, that those assets and the people of Tasmania deserve. 

I commend the Auditor-General for his thorough investigation and his frank findings. I hope that there will be clarification in the review of the Audit Act to make it absolutely clear that he has every right to access the Cabinet documents that he needs to form a well-considered opinion,  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=257.9_D=6.0_C=0.49] and I call on the government to implement his recommendations swiftly and completely to ensure the lessons of Wilkinsons Point are learned and that such failures are never repeated [Bookmark: Phr22_O=264.7_D=3.8_C=0.74] . I note the motion.

 [Bookmark: Phr23_O=270.5_D=3.7_C=0.63] [8.34 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr24_O=281.3_D=23.7_C=0.83] Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I rise on behalf of the government to make a contribution to this motion regarding the Auditor-General's Report Number 3 2025-26, which examines the proposed sale of Crown land at Wilkinsons Point. 

At the outset, I wish to place on record the government's appreciation for the work of the Auditor-General and his office. Their examination was thorough and detailed, and the government welcomes this scrutiny. Independent oversight such as this strengthens the integrity of our public institutions and ensures continuous improvement in the way government conducts its business.

This proposal has a long history. It arose from an unsolicited proposal received in 2019 that sought to bring together several related initiatives, being a redevelopment of the Derwent Entertainment Centre and the establishment of the Tasmanian NBL team and broader activation of Wilkinsons Point Precinct. At the time, the Government saw a genuine opportunity to revitalise an underutilised area, to encourage private investment and to enhance Tasmania's standing in a national sport and entertainment.

These objectives were and remain in the public interest. The establishment of the JackJumpers team has proven to be an overwhelming success story for our state and the member for Murchison talked about that in her contribution. Since joining the National Basketball League in 2021, the JackJumpers have quickly become a source of immense pride for Tasmanians, uniting communities across the north and the south.

Their remarkable rise culminated in the club's maiden NBL Championship in 2024. The team's achievements have showcased Tasmania's passion for sport and community, elevated our national profile and brought tens of thousands of fans back to the revitalised Derwent Entertainment Centre, now MyState Bank Arena.

Several agreements were entered into over the following years relating to the operation and upgrade of the Derwent Entertainment Centre, sponsorship arrangements and team commitments. However, it is important to note that no sale of land has ever occurred, and no binding agreement is in place. The Crown continues to own both the MyState Bank arena and the surrounding land parcels at Wilkinsons Point.

The Auditor-General's report is comprehensive and candid. It identified a number of areas where improvements could be made in how agencies manage complex land transactions, including valuation timing, communication between departments, and documentation of advice. Importantly, the report does not find any evidence of improper purpose, misconduct or personal benefit. The shortcomings identified are administrative in nature and relate to sequencing, governance and documentation. Matters which are by their very nature capable of being improved. 

The government acknowledges these findings and accepts them in full. The departments involved, the Department of State Growth, Department of Natural Resources and Environment and the Department of Premier and Cabinet have all cooperated fully with the review and have accepted all recommendations.

I'm advised that significant steps have already been taken to implement these recommendations including a strengthened and clearer framework for setting reserve prices for crown land, more robust conflict of interest declaration procedures, revised protocols around sharing of valuation material and unsolicited proposal assessments, and enhanced guidance on interagency coordination when cabinet decisions are implemented.

These improvements have been endorsed by the Secretary's Board and are now being applied consistently across the state service. The government takes very seriously its responsibilities to manage public assets transparently and in the public interest. That is why these findings have been embraced rather than resisted. The government has accepted all recommendations and is actively embedding the lessons from this report into everyday practise.

I'm advised that the Secretary of State Growth and the Secretary of Natural Resources and Environment have each personally overseen the implementation of new procedures to ensure that processes are watertight for any future transactions. It should also be said that the original intent of the proposal was sound and genuine.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=18.1_D=24.5_C=0.80] The project sought to unlock significant community and economic benefits through job creation, private investment and a modern sports and entertainment precinct that would enhance Tasmania's national profile. Decisions made at the time were made in good faith and in a fast-moving environment when the opportunities such as securing an NBL franchise for Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr3_O=43.6_D=0.7_C=0.85] , were time critical. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=45.0_D=25.9_C=0.85]  The government's motivation was always to deliver the best outcome for the state.

For clarity and for the benefit of the Chamber, the government advises that no sale of crown land has occurred at Wilkinson Point, and no final decision has been made to dispose of any land. Any decision to proceed will be subject to the full statutory process under the  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=72.0_D=16.9_C=0.80] Crown Lands Act 1976, including an independent valuation by the Valuer-General, the setting of a reserve price by the Director-General of Lands and due consideration of advice through the appropriate processes. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=89.7_D=14.0_C=0.81]  Key public areas including the foreshore, the ferry access area and Loyd Road, are not under consideration for sale. The MyState Bank Arena will remain in public ownership.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=104.0_D=13.9_C=0.86] Discussions continue within government to ensure that any future approach to the precinct is consistent with both the recommendations of the Auditor-General and the expectations of the Tasmanian community. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=118.6_D=15.3_C=0.87]  The government has a strong record in embracing accountability and transparency. In recent years, we've seen significant progress in how information is proactively disclosed, and this report forms part of that broader culture of improvement.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=134.5_D=29.5_C=0.85] The acceptance of all recommendations by the department demonstrates the government's commitment to good governance. These improvements will strengthen how complex projects are managed, ensure better documentation of advice and reduce risks in future crown land transactions. The lessons learned from this report are already being applied across the state service to ensure that major projects, whether initiated by government or by [Bookmark: Phr10_O=164.2_D=29.9_C=0.81]  external proponents are managed with the appropriate rigour and transparency.

While this report quite properly highlights procedural weaknesses, it also acknowledges that the broader vision for Wilkinsons Point retains merit. It remains a site with genuine potential for economic and community activation. The government is committed to working through the next steps carefully and responsibly. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=194.8_D=13.0_C=0.80]  Agencies are reviewing valuation parameters, governance frameworks and stakeholder engagement processes to ensure that when decisions are made, they are sound, defensible and  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=209.2_D=29.5_C=0.80] they demonstrate in the public interest. As members will appreciate, negotiations of this kind of complex and require careful management. The government is continuing to work constructively with stakeholders to ensure the best possible outcome for Tasmania, consistent with the recommendations.

In conclusion, the government welcomes the Auditor-General's report No. 3 of 2025-26 and again accepts all of its [Bookmark: Phr13_O=238.8_D=30.0_C=0.80]  recommendations and the departments involved have taken responsibility, implemented improvements and strengthened governance frameworks to ensure these lessons are embedded in future practise. Again, no sale has occurred, and no binding agreement exist. The processes are being rebuilt stronger than before. The government remains focused on achieving a positive and responsible outcome for Wilkinsons Point, one that protects public value [Bookmark: Phr14_O=268.9_D=29.6_C=0.78] , supports the economic development and maintains public confidence. I again thank the Auditor-General and the officers of the Tasmanian Audit Office for their careful work.

It's also acknowledged, the cooperation of the Department of State Growth and the Department of Natural Resources and Environment and the Department of Premier and Cabinet, particularly the Secretary of State Growth, the Director General of Lands and the Valuer-General for their proactive engagement [Bookmark: Phr15_O=298.6_D=6.4_C=0.80]  and their willingness to act swiftly on the report's findings. The government supports the motion that this report be considered and noted and looks forward to continuing to strengthen public trust through transparent and accountable administration in the management of our state's assets.

[8.45 p.m.]
Ms THOMAS (Elwick) - Mr President, thank you. I thank the member for Murchison for bringing this report on for noting. I won't speak at length, given the findings have been clearly summarised by the member for Murchison, and the fact that I spoke on this exact matter on adjournment on 25 September, in some detail too, the day after the report was released by the Auditor General, as I was alarmed and concerned about the findings and concerned about actions that the government might take, and seeking a commitment from government not to proceed with any sale in light of those findings at that time back in September.

In fact, I first raised concern about this deal in February this year when the government announced, maybe untruthfully, that the land had been sold, the media release said the deal had been done, with all that was left to be done to complete the deal was that the value was to be provided by the Valuer-General, and we've heard what the Auditor-General's report found about what proceeded from there.

In fact, I've written to the Premier three times on this matter now, seeking surety on behalf of my community and Tasmanians, twice raising concerns, and once during the election campaign this year seeking a commitment from the Premier that no deal would be done during caretaker period, because whilst we all ought to assume that no such thing would occur, we can't really safely assume these things, given some of the things that have occurred in the past.

Unfortunately, the Premier didn't reply for some weeks. I did get assurance after the election that no deal had been done during caretaker, but was left hanging a bit on a response to that request. In May this year, as I mentioned when I spoke on adjournment, I sought a briefing from the Secretary of Department of State Growth on what was going on here, what process had been undertaken to dispose of the land and what process had been undertaken.

The Secretary of the Department of State Growth assured me that everything was fine. The process for disposal of land had gone through what's called the unsolicited proposals process, which is a policy and guidelines issued by the Department of Treasury and Finance, and the flowchart clearly outlines that the process for considering unsolicited proposals includes at stage 1: that unsolicited proposal is to be received and assessed for eligibility by the Coordinator-General.

At stage 1 the proposal is to include all relevant information to enable the initial assessment of the proposal. That's the process that the secretary of Department of State Growth told me had been followed; but what we learned through the Auditor-General's report was that, in fact, the Coordinator-General knew nothing of this proposal for sale: knew nothing. How disappointing to be told one thing and then learn through an Auditor-General's report that that was totally, completely untrue. I do not like being treated like a fool.

Fortunately, as the leader has said, the land has not been sold. I have been assured now by the Premier that it is proceeding through the proper land disposal process and that perhaps the Department of Premier and Cabinet is having something to do with it as well. The first stage through the proper land disposal process is that parties agree the master plan, and that stage has not yet been completed. 

I want to make it clear on the record that I wholeheartedly support the development of land at Wilkinsons Point. This is certainly welcomed by the Glenorchy community and in fact, if it doesn't go ahead, there will certainly be an element of feeling like we've been a bit taken for a ride, in that LK Group came along and struck a deal with the government to sponsor the JackJumpers and invest in upgrades to the Derwent Entertainment Centre, now the MyState Bank Arena, which the government invested some $76 million in, and at the same time the developer promised to develop the area.

That was the commitment given by the mainland developer LK Group, so the community is quite excited about that. There was a wonderful website established outlining the proposal for the development, what it would look like with hotel, cafes, retail precinct, all sorts of wonderful development along the foreshore there. It's prime waterfront land. It's ripe for development. I and my community would welcome that; but Tasmanians deserve transparency around sale processes and to be assured that the best interests of Tasmanians are at heart in any disposal process, not favouring the interests of any developer. In fact, this is in the best interest of the government and any developer that due process is followed, too.

I had developers approach me questioning why there was no tender process. What if they'd been interested in purchasing the land or developing the land? They might have been interested if they knew that the government was prepared to invest $6 million in making the land development ready, which is what we heard at one stage. That's probably all I will say about that for now. I thank the Auditor-General and his team for their work on the report. I thank members of the community who have reported concerns about this through to the Auditor-General. Certainly it is, as the member for Murchison said, something that the Public Accounts Committee certainly does have an eye on. It just makes you worry and wonder: what else don't we know?

That's the concern here, and how do we unearth these things? We've all got areas of interest in this place and the other place, and we rely on community members to call out concerns when they rightly feel them, but we can't be across everything. I'm grateful that the work has been done on this particular deal and I really hope the government will be transparent with the community at some point going forward. In my last letter to the Premier, I asked him to consider making some sort of public statement about where things are at, because we've had the JackJumpers in for five years now. This was something that was promised to the community five years ago and it seems to have stalled. 

People ask me what's going on with it, why aren't we seeing any action? So it would be transparent by the government to actually make some public statement about what is happening or what the plans are, what the process is. If it's gone back to square one, then be transparent about that. If there is a master plan being developed, share some information about that, what it looks like. Will there be a consultation process? I don't have any answers for my community. Thank you again, member for Murchison, for bringing this for our consideration and noting.

[8.52 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, I don't have anything particular to add. I just want to thank members for their contributions, and I know this is something we need to keep an eye on because there's been a lot of promises made, not much delivered and identification of some pretty serious failures of governance. I reiterate the member for Elwick's comment: what else don't we know? What else is going a bit pear shaped like this?

We've had a few projects, and we're about to speak about another one that's even worse, potentially. We don't know what we don't know, but we do all have an obligation to hold the government to account and where there are concerns raised that they've been properly investigated. I thank the members for their contribution. I thank the Auditor-General and his office for their work. 

Motion agreed to.


MOTION

Parliamentary Standing Committee of Public Accounts Report: TT-Line Spirit of Tasmania Vessel Replacement Project Interim Report - Consideration and Noting

[8.53 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, this is the last one for me today. It's a shame that we're doing this late at night. It is such an important matter, but anyway, here we are. As members would be aware, and I think the whole of the world, and Scotland in particular, are aware, there's been a bit of a problem with the delivery of two big red ships. The Public Accounts Committee originally started an inquiry into this matter, particularly the focus of this interim report, and there will be further reports to come. We haven't finished the work yet, because the vessels aren't in service yet and the berth is not built in Devonport yet. 

We started when there was some concern raised predominantly around the extra €50 million that was paid to the Finnish shipbuilder during the caretaker period. When we started looking into that, it became apparent fairly promptly that the required berthing infrastructure was nowhere near finished either. In speaking about this interim report, which is the first of others, we need to remember that it does not cover the whole story to date. It covers from when we commenced this inquiry - and I will get to that in a moment - up to the end of 2024.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=16.2_D=13.8_C=0.76] This interim report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Accounts into the TT-Line Spirit of Tasmania Vessel Replacement Program, I just shake my head in disbelief, as so many other Tasmanians do.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.7_D=22.6_C=0.76] Obviously, we had a couple of elections during the period this inquiry has been going on and we have had a bit of a committee turnover, and so as we have worked through and deliberated on this report for the new members of the committee, which were half the new members - all the Lower House members were new members of the committee - I think they said as we were reading through it and deliberating on it, they thought, 'Really? How did this happen?' Just when you thought it could not get any worse it did.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=55.1_D=4.0_C=0.57]  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=60.1_D=29.4_C=0.78] This report documents what can only be described as one of Tasmania's most significant infrastructure delivery-and-governance failures. Vessels originally promised for 2021 will not be operational until at least late 2026, a delay of more than five years. But the timeline failure only tells part of the story. This report reveals systemic breakdowns in governance, planning, oversight and accountability that have profound  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=89.6_D=30.0_C=0.77] implications for how this state manages major projects. This report clearly sets out the timelines from the announcement of the new vessels in December 2017 up until December 2024. 

The committee will report events since that time - that is December 2024 - in a later report as the PAC maintains its ongoing scrutiny of the TT-Line and the delivery of the two new vessels and the purpose built berthing  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=119.8_D=27.1_C=0.76] facilities in Devonport, and the ongoing costs associated with both. The ongoing scrutiny was referred from the House of Assembly. We had already had an inquiry on foot and then the Lower House sent a reference to the committee to continue the oversight work and also to look at the tourism impacts and other aspects. 

Clearly the more recent report by the Auditor-General in matters  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=147.7_D=3.4_C=0.64] of the solvency of the TT-Line will also be recorded in due course, so I am not going to speak about those matters particularly because that evidence came to light after December 2024.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=151.5_D=7.3_C=0.85]  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=161.7_D=2.4_C=0.78] To be clear about what has occurred. Two new  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=165.0_D=15.2_C=0.66] Spirit of Tasmania vessels, each costing approximately €301 million, approximately $AUD530 million, after variations, are sitting unused, not in service. One in Geelong at anchor  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=180.7_D=10.2_C=0.79] last we heard, at least, and one in a locked port in Leith, Scotland, while TT-Line scrambles to build the berth infrastructure that should have been ready before they arrived.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=192.5_D=4.4_C=0.73] The first new vessel departed Finland in January 2025.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=197.3_D=8.1_C=0.83] Both vessels are now incurring holding costs while generating no revenue, a financial drain that compounds with every passing month. Whilst I  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=206.0_D=8.9_C=0.76] acknowledge, according to the evidence we have received in the Public Accounts Committee and in other committees like Estimates Committee and GBE Scrutiny, storing the Spirit of Tasmania V in Leith in Scotland is a cheaper option than storing it somewhere in Australia.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=216.6_D=13.6_C=0.82] It is a fact that these costs should not have been incurred in the first place, that we cannot overlook.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=231.6_D=24.3_C=0.71] The berth infrastructure projected has ballooned from an initial estimate of what we now understand to be completely fanciful figure of $90 million under TasPorts to TT-Line self-managing the tenant works project now budgeted at $493 million. I do note the new management in TT-Line; the board and management  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=257.1_D=4.4_C=0.88] have been effectively completely replaced, and I do have  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=261.8_D=18.0_C=0.79] great confidence in the management team who are overseeing that Mr Paul Kirkwood is an eminently qualified individual who did actually oversee, on behalf of BMD, the delivery of the Geelong facilities for the Spirit of Tasmania vessels.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=281.1_D=23.8_C=0.73] I note that the TasPorts-required wharf infrastructure - because TasPorts did have a component they were responsible for and did build, the wharf - was completed many months ago, albeit and how it needs to have a replacement of a number of the fenders, as TT-Line insisted on the incorrect specifications, but that is a matter for the next instalment in PAC's reporting because that was brought to light after the end of December. The PAC's reporting on the absolute fiasco will continue. This is a bit of a one-of-a-kind, and when people from the mainland or other places ask about it [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.1_D=2.5_C=0.67] , they think we must be making half of this up.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.3_D=12.6_C=0.82] The vessels were to transform Tasmania's tourism capacity and freight capability, and now they sit idle, representing not just direct costs but massive opportunity cost to our economy. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=44.7_D=25.7_C=0.79]  This interim report addresses the two major failures up until December 2024 that converged to create this crisis. 

First, the vessel contracts and the caretaker period issues. The vessel replacement saga began promisingly enough in December 2017. Contracts worth €219 million per vessel [Bookmark: Phr5_O=71.3_D=2.4_C=0.62]  were signed with German shipbuilder, FSG. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=75.1_D=29.4_C=0.75]  I'm not going to try and say the German name because I will butcher it, and FSG will do. When that contract was terminated in this February 2020 due to FSG's financial difficulties, fortunately on this occasion, that occurred before any payments were made so no money was lost in that case. Then TT-Line entered negotiations with the Finnish shipbuilder Rauma Marine Constructions or RMC.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=105.8_D=28.0_C=0.79] Following intervention by both the Morrison government demanding increased local content due to the COVID-19 economic concerns, and the state Liberal government at the time under premier Gutwein, a delay occurred when the contract was about to be signed with RMC requiring TT-Line to go back and reinvestigate Australian capacity to build the ships here in Australia. Note here that this work had been done previously [Bookmark: Phr8_O=133.9_D=21.2_C=0.80]  and it had been found that Australia did not have the capacity for this sort of vessel. But the Morrison government wanted to stop this process and perhaps look to Western Australia to see if they could deliver these vessels. This work, as I said, had been done prior to the FSG contract have been entered into.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=156.2_D=6.2_C=0.74] That created a delay, and after that delay a new contract was signed with RMC [Bookmark: Phr10_O=163.6_D=9.7_C=0.82]  in April 2021, and that's the same company that they are about to sign a contract for when they were told by the Morrison government to pull it. So they lost their spot in the queue. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=174.4_D=15.9_C=0.85]  In addition to that, the new contract had an additional cost of €25 million with commitments to deliver between AUD50 and AUD100 million in Tasmanian local content. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=191.2_D=25.9_C=0.79]  Then came the force majeure event, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and we're all aware that that event triggered supply chain disruptions, but this was particularly impacted the construction of these two vessels because the steel yard that RMC used to source the steel was bombed by the Russians [Bookmark: Phr13_O=218.4_D=3.5_C=0.70] . Those circumstances resulted in an €8 million [Bookmark: Phr14_O=223.6_D=3.8_C=0.77]  price increase and further delivery delays.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=228.8_D=14.0_C=0.80] The truly problematic events occurred during the state's 2024 election caretaker period. On 16 January 2024, RMC advised TT-Line of insufficient liquidity to complete the vessels. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=243.5_D=22.3_C=0.78]  By late February, this requirement had escalated to €100 million across both contracts. What happened next raises serious concerns about governance during caretaker periods. On 14 February 2024, the Premier called an early election for 23 March commencing the caretaker period.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=266.6_D=24.7_C=0.81] Four days later, on 28 February, the pre-election financial outlook report was released with no mention whatsoever the emerging financial risks with the vessel replacement program. Instead, the Treasury Secretary elected to hold separate confidential briefings with both major parties the following day. Critically at these 29 February meetings, whilst RMC [Bookmark: Phr18_O=292.7_D=2.5_C=0.59] 's potential insolvency was discussed [Bookmark: Phr19_O=295.6_D=9.4_C=0.84] , the subsequent €50 million contract price increase was not mentioned. It appears this was information Treasury had but chose not to disclose.

On 21 March 2024, just two days before the election and deep into the caretaker period, the TT-Line board approved a contract price increase of up to €30 million and advised the then shareholder minister. The next day, Treasury advised TT-Line that government approval wasn't required for price changes to already approved procurement projects. Remember that we're talking about €30 million here, Mr President, it's not a small amount. Then on 4 April 2024, after the election but still during the caretaker period, TT-Line executed contract amendments totalling €50 million. The shareholder minister still wasn't formally advised by letter until the next day after the contracts were signed.

This sequence of events exposes gaps in the governance frameworks for government businesses during caretaker period particularly. While Treasury's advice that board approval was technically sufficient may be legally correct, it completely sidesteps the question of whether major financial commitments should be made during caretaker periods and whether information material to voters should be withheld from pre-election financial reports.

Then we move on to the berth infrastructure catastrophe. If the vessels contract issues represent a government's problem, the berth infrastructure failure represents a governance catastrophe. In 2017, TT-Line's business case assumed infrastructure upgrades would be TasPorts' responsibility. TasPorts' 2018 Port Masterplan included a $50 to $60 million development.

The TasPorts CEO advised parliament in December 2019 that TasPorts would fund infrastructure on a cost recovery basis from tenants. That arrangement fundamentally changed in July 2019. TasPorts advised TT-Line that retaining the existing terminal at berth one wasn't feasible, and TasPorts' scope could only cover works from the ground down, not including buildings or above ground facilities. TT-Line would need to fund and deliver all tenant works, including terminal buildings, ramps and passenger facilities.

From June 2020, TT-Line consistently maintained they were ferry operators not in the business of building infrastructure and that TasPorts, as port operator should construct all infrastructure and lease it back. TasPorts rejected this position.

Commercial negotiations reached an impasse, which is probably a little bit of an understatement. TasPorts proposed increasing TT-Line's operating costs by 250 per cent, plus a separate capital charge of $77.58 million payable over 25 years at 8.4 per cent return. TT-Line disputed these costs as excessive, particularly as they claimed no additional services or improvement in service quality was to be provided.

It wasn't until 29 June 2021, a year after those comments and four years after the vessel business case, that the parties served a term sheet delineating responsibility. Under this agreement, TT-Line would self-manage what had become a $375 million infrastructure project, despite lacking the organisational structure and expertise for such an undertaking. The critical delays that followed tell their own story.

With regard to geotechnical investigations, TT-Line claimed they were prevented from conducting geotechnical studies in the river from October 2022 due to TasPorts' ongoing dredging. TasPorts countered that floating plant could have been relocated.

Ms Rattray - It's almost tit-for-tat.

Ms FORREST - Yes. TT-Line claim full access wasn't granted until September 2023, 12 weeks late, and on it went.

There were tendering delays. TT-Line issued an expression of interest in December 2022, with the main tender closing in August 2023, behind schedule. Preferred tenderer, Hazell Bros Brady Marine Joint Venture was appointed in October 2023.

Between October 2023 and February 2024, TT-Line failed to execute a contract with the preferred tenderer. In February 2024, the tender came back $76.7 million higher, now totalling $229 million.

On 2 of April 2024, during caretaker period, TT-Line revoked the preferred tender status without notifying the government. The shareholder minister wasn't informed until the monthly update received on the 22 April, after the caretaker period ended. It is also noteworthy that it was evident in late November 2023 things were completely off track.

On 10 November 2023, concerns were sufficient that the then shareholder minister convened a meeting with both government businesses. This is the famous play nicely in the sandpit meeting that resulted in a program integrated support. Mr Peter Gemell commenced in December 2023, his report showed TT-line initially advising interim berthing will be ready by August 2024. By February this has shifted to May 2025, and Mr Gemell's 12 February report recommended terminating the integrated role, noting circumstances where material improvement was possible had passed.

On the 17 June 2024, following the election, the shareholder ministers issued formal directions to both TT-Line and TasPorts, expressing disappointment that berthing infrastructure would not be ready and noting TT-Lines unilateral caretaker decision had caused further delays. That was the decision to terminate the preferred tenderer status or contract.

In August 2024, the government appointed infrastructure experts Mr Peter Gemell and Mr Ben Moloney to assess options to enable the new vessels to be brought into service prior to the completion of new berth. berth three. They've applied their report, and it's published on the State Growth website, and their October report was damning.

Berth one is the current berth that the current Spirit of Tasmania vessels are using, berth two is where SeaRoad, Chas Kelly's shipping organisation pulls up and berth three is the new facility for the Spirit of Tasmania vessels when the new ones come online.

Option one; they spoke about modifying berth one - the current berth - using the existing vessels only. This was costed at $28.6 million, but simulations determined it would be unsafe and not viable. Option 2, modifying berths one and berths two costed at $44 million plus residual risks of $16 million.

This was necessary because Chas Kelly rightly raised concerns about interactions or illusion. It's called when ships run into each other because of the the larger size of the vessels and he also has quite large vessels in the river.

Mr Gemell and Mr Moloney said that with option 2, while potentially safe, estimated benefits of only $18 million to 44 million against $60 million of cost meant the investment was not commercially justified and would only enable single level loading, significantly extending loading times from three hours to five to six hours. Again, not a viable option.

The report concluded the only viable path was completing permanent berth three infrastructure, with completion potentially in October 2026 if risks were mitigated, or February 2027 if they couldn't be. It should be noted that the new berthing facilities had been built some years before at the Port of Geelong. That was required obviously, when TT-Line moved their operations from the Port of Melbourne to the Port of Geelong and these facilities that are in the Port of Geelong were constructed to cater for the current and new vessels.

We managed to do it over there and the oversee of that project was Paul Kirkwood is now overseeing the Devonport berth development. That was some work undertaken on behalf of the Port of Geelong by RMD, the company that Mr Kirkwood's working for. The failures which cost those companies and the state dearly resulted in wholesale leadership changes and ones to suggest that is as it should be. On the 14 August 2024, TT-Line Chairman Mike Grainger resigned hours after being given an ultimatum by e-mail following he publicly disputed the evidence provided to the to the Public Accounts Committee.

On 26 August 2024, the Infrastructure minister, Michael Ferguson, resigned from that portfolio.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=7.8_D=15.0_C=0.73] On 7 September 2024 TT-Line CEO Bernard Dwyer tendered his resignation from the date of the end of his current contract, which was ended on the third or thereabouts of November 2024. On 14 October,  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=23.1_D=3.4_C=0.79] the honourable Michael Ferguson MP resigned from Cabinet entirely. He was [Bookmark: Phr5_O=27.1_D=18.4_C=0.77]  still Treasurer at the time and he resigned completely from Cabinet. On 17 October 2024 TasPorts Chairman Stephen Bradford announced his retirement. These were not routine transitions; these were the consequences of major project failure on a massive scale. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=46.7_D=5.0_C=0.68]  The committee identified systemic failures that go beyond individual decisions.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=52.4_D=5.3_C=0.72] I will just list some of these off:

unresolved commercial arrangements [Bookmark: Phr8_O=58.7_D=16.9_C=0.82] : despite knowing since 2017 that infrastructure upgrades were required, commercial agreements between TasPorts and TT-Line were not finalised until July 2022. The five-year delay prevented critical design and construction work from commencing on realistic timelines [Bookmark: Phr9_O=76.8_D=14.2_C=0.78] ;

inadequate project governance: TT-Line-established governance was inadequate to deliver a $375 million self-managed major infrastructure project with $1 billion in vessels dependent on time-critical completion;

skills and capability gaps: TT-Line lacked the in-house expertise, project management capability and organisational structure to deliver a project of this scale and complexity. As they reminded the committee, they were ferry operators being asked to become major infrastructure developers [Bookmark: Phr11_O=112.6_D=27.7_C=0.74] ;

information and escalation failures: monthly CEO reports during critical periods masked deteriorating project conditions through nuanced language changes and implausible delivery dates. The minister was not informed of the rescission of preferred tenderer until after the caretaker period ended. The program integrator's February report recommending termination of his role was not provided to the minister until April.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=140.8_D=1.9_C=0.53] That is, the February report was not provided until [Bookmark: Phr13_O=143.1_D=19.2_C=0.76]  April, despite the minister's explicit directive for greater departmental oversight. The minister had explicitly asked for the Secretary of State Growth to have taken a greater role in this, but that February report was not handed over until April [Bookmark: Phr14_O=163.9_D=19.6_C=0.77] ;

caretaker period complications: critical decisions regarding €50 million in additional vessel costs were made during the caretaker period. Board decisions relating to berth 3 delivery made during caretaker period were not relayed to the shareholder minister. Material information was withheld from the pre-election financial outlook [Bookmark: Phr15_O=184.4_D=18.8_C=0.78] ;

the absence of independent oversight: until April 2024, when project failure was already evident, no independent oversight mechanism existed to identify and escalate emerging project failures. Two government-owned entities were operating in silos despite critical project dependencies.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=203.9_D=2.5_C=0.70] They were looking at each other across the water, or across the wharf [Bookmark: Phr17_O=207.6_D=1.1_C=0.81]  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=209.7_D=19.0_C=0.67] ; and

interface management breakdown: despite the program integrator appointment in November 2023, coordination between TasPort's QuayLink works and TT-Line's tenant works remained problematic, with disputes over site access continuing through 2023 and 2024.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=229.6_D=3.4_C=0.79] Mr President, the financial impact of this is staggering.  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=233.5_D=18.7_C=0.75] Vessel costs increased from the original €219 million per vessel to approximately €300 million per vessel. Berth 3 infrastructure increased from a $90 million estimate - probably underdone - to approaching $493 million. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=253.0_D=26.0_C=0.78]  TT-Line's borrowing facility increased from $700 million to $1.035 billion in December 2023, and a temporary $1.4 billion in July 2025. The PAC will report further on that in subsequent reports. Two new vessels sitting unused, one in Scotland, one in Geelong, while incurring holding costs and  [Bookmark: Phr22_O=279.9_D=0.8_C=0.65] foregone revenue:  [Bookmark: Phr23_O=282.2_D=8.2_C=0.80] opportunity cost to Tasmania's tourism industry and broader economy runs at potentially $350 million per annum based on 2020 modelling. [Bookmark: Phr24_O=291.2_D=5.2_C=0.85]  This saga has been worse than an episode of Utopia because it is all true. The committee made  [Bookmark: Phr25_O=297.7_D=3.2_C=0.76] 70 findings in total, but our overarching finding deserves emphasis:

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=6.2_D=17.3_C=0.78] The failure to deliver suitable berthing infrastructure for the new Spirit of Tasmania vessels represents a fundamental breakdown in governance in the collaboration between two government-owned entities, despite both TasPorts and TT-Line being wholly owned by the Tasmanian government and the people of Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=24.3_D=9.0_C=0.78] The committee found some extraordinary failures: critical commercial agreements were unresolved for four years despite common government ownership. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=34.5_D=11.5_C=0.66]  No overarching government structure was in place to coordinate the delivery of interdependent infrastructure. No independent project assurance function was in place until failure was evident. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=47.4_D=4.8_C=0.79]  A ferry operator was self-managing major infrastructure without the necessary expertise. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=53.4_D=4.6_C=0.68]  Ongoing coordination failures and unresolved disputes occurred throughout. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=59.5_D=6.6_C=0.75]  Critical decisions and deteriorating conditions were not appropriately conveyed to ministers.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=69.7_D=12.1_C=0.70] This is not how government-owned entities should operate. This is not how major projects should be managed, and this is not how the Tasmanian people's money should be spent. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=83.0_D=2.6_C=0.71]  The committee made five recommendations [Bookmark: Phr10_O=86.7_D=5.7_C=0.74]  focused on preventing these failures from recurring ever again, and I will read these: [Bookmark: Phr11_O=93.5_D=1.6_C=0.85]  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=95.6_D=9.8_C=0.76] 

Clarifying governance during caretaker periods: as part of government business governance reforms, clarify what obligations state-owned businesses have to inform [Bookmark: Phr13_O=106.1_D=17.3_C=0.85]  and seek approval from shareholder ministers regarding material commercial decisions, and how these obligations are to be met during caretaker periods. 

It doesn't help having early elections every year, but there is no reason to not have proper process.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=124.7_D=24.1_C=0.77] Disclosure in pre-election financial reports: Treasury must adopt clear protocols for disclosure of material commercial risks in the pre-election financial outlook reports and arrangements for managing commercially-sensitive information during caretaker periods.

We all accept that sometimes you can't put everything in the report [Bookmark: Phr15_O=152.0_D=2.5_C=0.88] , but it's wrong not to make it available at all [Bookmark: Phr16_O=156.3_D=1.6_C=0.68] , or give some indication of it.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=160.6_D=1.4_C=0.82]  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=163.0_D=17.4_C=0.71] Further investigation of delays: the government should further investigate the circumstance that led to the 12-week delay in TasPorts completing dredging works, the extended period before TT-Line could access the berth pocket, and the decision-making timeline for TT-Line's berth 3 tenant works [Bookmark: Phr19_O=181.3_D=3.7_C=0.76] , including the 18-month gap between agreement for lease [Bookmark: Phr20_O=185.8_D=20.4_C=0.77]  and appointing the preferred tenderer. 

The reason the committee recommends this is because it was so hard to get beyond what the leader rightly identified as tit for tat. They say this, we say that. We have competing arguments. We have photos showing one thing, an argument showing another. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=207.6_D=20.0_C=0.72]  I think it would be helpful for the government to do this, to learn what went wrong so we don't have this happening again. When you consider there are a number of our GBEs and state-owned companies who do have to interact with each other: Hydro Tasmania and Irrigation Tasmania, Hydro Tasmania and TasNetworks, TasPorts and TasRail [Bookmark: Phr22_O=228.2_D=12.2_C=0.69] , TasPorts and TT-Line, there are many interactions, and not all of them have interdependent projects like this, but they all do need to connect with each other [Bookmark: Phr23_O=241.8_D=28.9_C=0.80] . We do recommend the government have a deeper dive into that to discover how we can avoid such a thing happening again. 

Integrated project governance: future major infrastructure projects involving multiple government-owned businesses must have, from inception, integrated project governance structures and reporting arrangements, independent project assurance functions, clear commercial agreements prior to [Bookmark: Phr24_O=271.3_D=5.0_C=0.70]  design commencement, resolution mechanisms for commercial and interface disputes. [Bookmark: Phr25_O=277.9_D=4.8_C=0.76]  

I believe some of this may have already commenced. I'm sure the leader, if she's responding to this debate [Bookmark: Phr26_O=284.4_D=10.9_C=0.87] , may have an update on some of that. I believe that some of it is possibly on-foot already, but these are critical measures to ensure we don't see this sort of fiasco again. [Bookmark: Phr27_O=296.5_D=8.5_C=0.74] 

Enhanced reporting requirements: reporting requirements of major capital projects by government-owned businesses must include specific milestone achievement updates, material changes to project timelines or budgets, early warning indicators of project delivery risks, and consequences for providing implausible and misleading information.

The PAC doesn't want to have to oversee every major project in this state. We're overseeing this one, subject to the debate the next two days, we could be overseeing another one. It really shouldn't be the PAC's job to ensure that the government can deliver infrastructure as planned. We should be able to rely on the government to do that.

Clearly, this has highlighted that there does need to be more rigorous oversight. One would hope that the mechanism be put in place within the government frameworks to prevent the need for this. 

To conclude, it is appalling that vessels originally promised for 2021 will not serve Tasmania until at least late-2026, more than five years late. The cost to the Tasmanian taxpayers includes not only the direct financial burden now exceeding $1.5 billion, but the substantial ongoing opportunity cost to our tourism industry and the broader economy. It's the northwest of the state that has suffered the most as a result of this. Every month the vessels sit idle, it represents revenue not earned, tourists not carried, freight capacity not available or not utilised, regional businesses not supported, and holding costs accumulated. 

It may be cheaper to keep the Spirit of Tasmania V in Leith in Scotland, in a locked port, but it should not have been needed anyway. The northwest coast in particular, as I said, bears a disproportionate burden of these delays. The tourism operators, the producers, the businesses that rely on Bass Strait connectivity have been left waiting year-after-year, while governance failures compounded. 

This project should serve as a case study in what not to do. Don't allow commercial arrangements between government entities to remain unresolved for years. Don't ask an organisation to manage a project type that's far outside their core capability without proper support. Don't establish government structures inadequate for the project scale. Don't operate in silos when project success requires coordination. Don't withhold information from the ministers or the public. Don't make major financial commitments during caretaker periods without transparent processes. And don't report implausible time-frames that mask deteriorating conditions.

The Australians Institute of Company Directors and the Governance Institute of Australia could and possibly should use this very sad saga as a case study in an absolute corporate failure to assist new and emerging directors to understand how to avoid such failures and to be alert to early signs of trouble.

There are many points on this journey when intervention may have turned things around or at least progressed things far more quickly than they have. Having done these AICD company directors' course, they do these sorts of case studies where you think what would you have done? When would you have intervened? I think it's a bit of a shameful part of our story here as Tasmanians, but it would be a pretty good case study of how badly things can go.

The committee will continue its oversight and will further report on matters related to the ongoing delivery of berth 3 and related infrastructure. As I said, this is an interim report because the story unfortunately, is not yet finished.

Some conclusions are already clear. This represents a fundamental failure of project governance, a failure of collaboration between two government entities, and a failure to protect Tasmanian taxpayers' interests. The leadership changes that have occurred, the resignations, the terminations of retirements, underscore the magnitude of these failures. 

Tasmania deserves infrastructure projects managed with competence, transparency and accountability. We deserve government-owned businesses that work together effectively and cooperatively. We deserve honest reporting and appropriate governance, particularly during sensitive periods like caretaker periods, and we deserve value for the enormous sums of public money being invested. 

Lessons from this project must be learned and applied. The recommendation of this report must be implemented, and the oversight must continue until these vessels are finally in service and delivering the benefits that were promised to Tasmania more than seven years ago.

Madam Acting President, I commend this interim report to the parliament and urge the government to treat the findings and recommendations with the seriousness they demand.

[9.30 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, the government would like to begin by thanking the Public Accounts Committee for its work delivering this interim report. It's a factual account of what has taken place in recent years and it's safe to say it's a review everyone wishes that we didn't need to take place. The minister has said recently that the Spirit of Tasmania vessel replacement and birth project has been significantly difficult for the Tasmanian government. More importantly, though, it is been significantly difficult for Tasmanians to accept, and rightly so.

The situation we found ourselves in is deeply regrettable and no-one, least of all the government, disputes this. The government's position has been clear since the well-publicised problems were first released, that we would sort the Spirits and back the state's tourism sector which is so important for the broader Tasmanian economy, and that's been outlined today by the honourable member for Murchison.

The government have gone further since then and delivered strong guarantees for the company's future. The government will not let the company fail. There are no circumstances under which they will allow this to occur. 

The Public Accounts Committee report into the vessel replacement project does not make for good reading. This contribution to the matter has been important. It has overseen a thorough process of review and highlights the importance of this committee. The interim report relates to events and issues that get us close to the present time. It predates Minister Vincent's role as one of the shareholder ministers and predates the current board and CEO. I don't say that to lessen the minister's current responsibilities or the responsibilities of the new board and CEO on delivering a solution for the issues that we all know about.

Much has changed in terms of the project's status over the past 11 months, and I would like to place on the parliamentary record the government's acknowledgement of the work of TT-Line Chair, Ken Kanofski, and the CEO, Chris Carbone, in a relatively short time frame. It's also acknowledged the collective and diligent work of the TT-Line board. The directors have had to deal with a series of highly complicated matters that required serious deliberations and considerations and challenges, but to their credit they've done an excellent job righting the ship, as it were.

Chairman Ken Konoski recently said during the GBE scrutiny of the company, that the Spirit of Tasmania vessels delivered an important and iconic ferry service for the state and that the crossing between Devonport and Geelong is part of the National Highway, providing a vital public service, enabling the company to deliver a substantial contribution to the state economy via the tourism industry and parts of the agriculture sector - and of course, he's right.

The company, the board and the management team have the government's support, and for good reason. The new board has, in just 11 months, brought the berth 3 project under control and is on track to deliver the project and have the new Spirit of Tasmania vessels operating by October 2026 within the revised budget that the board developed and announced, appointed a new CEO, and made changes in executive function within the business, worked hard to restore relationships with tourism and freight operators, addressed short- and medium-term financial challenges that were critical to the survival of the business, commissioned a review of all aspects of the business operation, which the company expects will deliver improvements over the coming months and years, commenced preparation for the entry into service of the new Spirit of Tasmania vessels, redeveloped a strong working relationship with TasPorts and made changes to management practices that were not contemporary and did not meet community expectations.

As you can hear, the work undertaken has been substantial. Though until recently largely unseen. Looking forward, the directors and management, with the assistance of specialist advisers, continue to work on developing a range of long-term financially sustainable options for the government to consider in the new year.

Meanwhile, it's business as usual for TT-Line. As noted, thanks to the detailed work of the board and the company that I've just outlined, berth three is progressing very well and is on track for completion in October 2026.

Spirit of Tasmania IV is in Geelong and Spirit of Tasmania V will travel to Tasmania for the first time next year. Of course, the Tasmanian government and TT-Line are excited about the new vessels commencing their operations in Bass Strait in October next year. The ships have been designed to deliver an exceptional sailing experience with increased comfort.

There will be more cabins, more recliners, including new business class recliners and an upgraded onboard experience with expanded catering outlets, dining and passenger lounges. The vessels were specifically designed and built with Bass Strait conditions in mind. They feature an enhanced whole design and large stabiliser fins that will ensure optimal passenger comfort while travelling the 242-kilometre voyage on Bass Strait between Devonport and Geelong.

The interiors of the Spirit of Tasmania IV and Spirit of Tasmania V will provide visitors to the state with a taste of what to expect when they arrive in our state. While things are looking and feeling positive, there is still much more work to do. The government and TT-Line have worked closely to ensure there is a mutual understanding about what this looks like.

The government is looking forward to getting on with the job and the minister looks forward to further participation in the PAC inquiry as it continues its important work.

Motion agreed to.


MOTION

Sue Neill-Fraser - An Independent Inquiry Can No Longer be Avoided - Report and Executive Summary

[9.38 p.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - Madam Acting President, I rise to share the new evidence that demonstrates serious shortcomings in the investigation and prosecution that led to Ms Sue Neill-Fraser's murder conviction. I refer not only to the Etter-Selby report, which I tabled last month, but to new evidence found since.

Broadly, that evidence follows two tracks. One is the significance of Ms Meaghan Vass's DNA that was left on the yacht in January 2009 and matched to her in March 2010, which was after Ms Neill-Fraser had been arrested.

The other track is the documentary evidence which shows the failure of police to make proper inquiries about Ms Vass, her associates, her mobile phones, break-ins to or thefts from boats around the time of the murder and any break-in at Cleanlift in Goodwood, to which the yacht was taken before the DNA was found on its deck.

I've raised concerns before about Ms Neill-Fraser's conviction in this place. I gave an adjournment speech in August 2021 when I tabled the first Etter-Selby papers about her case, outlining concerns with the police investigation, the forensics, such as the wrongful use of luminol to claim the presence of Bob's blood in the dinghy, and the possible misleading of the court. I was supported in that initiative by former premier and attorney-general Lara Giddings AO. I must admit I'd been elected in 2009. That was the first adjournment speech I had made 12 years. That's how seriously I took that situation.

Two years ago, I gave another speech in August 2023, highlighting further issues in the case, including concerns about a small blue towel and apparent non-disclosures. Despite all the work done to bring these matters to the attention of the government, there was no action taken. Whatever the reasons for that inaction, the latest independent scientific advances, along with the exposure of further investigative shortcomings, entail that averting one's gaze or asserting full confidence in the process so far will no longer work.

For those reasons, at the end of the speech I will make some specific suggestions as to what needs to happen immediately in the Neill-Fraser case to ensure that Sue gets justice. But that is not all. There are serious questions about the quality and oversight of the police investigation, the independence of Tasmanian Police Forensic Scientists Services, known as FSST, the handling of the disclosure to the courts by both police and the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions, and the lack of proper management of and support for Ms Meaghan Vass after she made sworn statements to have been on the yacht.

The question could be asked what happened to Meaghan Vass to make her recant those admissions in the witness box in 2021. Those are not questions that will be answered in the adversarial court system. I believe they can only be answered by an independent inquisitorial inquiry set up to identify mistakes and deficiencies and offer pragmatic solutions that will benefit us all in the future.

By the way of background, Sue Neill-Fraser was convicted in 2010 of the murder of her partner Bob Chappell on their moored yacht in Sandy Bay, Hobart, on Australia Day 2009. She was released on parole in 2022 after 13 years in prison.

This is a case with no body, no weapon and no time or cause of death. Sue has loyal supporters who've been seeking for 15 years to uncover fresh and compelling evidence to overturn conviction. Some of them are here today. Their tenacity and determination against the odds have been extraordinary.

Independent Tasmanian parliamentarians, both state and federal, have obtained valuable information from police and Tasmania's FSST records using our right to information legislation, despite delays, initial refusals, the frequent use of exemptions and their interpretation of public interest. As well as my fellow parliamentarians, I also acknowledge a speech highlighting some of the issues by Senator Jacqui Lambie in the Senate on 28 August 2025.

I note the wider public reaction to the tabled report. Its contents led the Mercury to publish a front-page story titled 'DNA Bombshell' and stating explosive new evidence could clear Neill-Fraser, as well as a two-page feature feature article and a powerful editorial that included these insightful comments: [tbc 9.43]

Critics may argue that this is another attempt to relitigate an exhausted case. But justice is not a matter of convenience or finality. It is a matter of truth. If credible scientific or evidentiary developments cast real doubt on a conviction, those developments must be examined, no matter how much time has passed or how uncomfortable the process may be. Tasmania's justice system prides itself on fairness and transparency. Both will be tested by how authorities respond to this latest evidence. The public, the courts and most importantly, the Chappell and Neill-Fraser families deserve to know whether the science and the truth have changed.

Many here today will recall the changing evidence of Ms Vass, whose DNA was found on the deck of the yacht. In 2010 and again in March 2012 she said she'd never been on the yacht. In 2017, she swore that she was on the yacht but at the leave to appeal hearing later in 2017 she denied being on the yacht and said she had signed the document out of fear. In 2019, Ms Vass again swore on 60 Minutes that she'd been on the yacht with others, but not Sue Neill-Fraser on the day of Bob Chappell's disappearance. It was the issue that led Justice Brett to grant leave to appeal in the case. However, Ms Vass recanted those admissions at the 2021 appeal. The only ground of appeal left concerned her DNA, including the central questions of when and how her DNA was deposited on the yacht deck. The argument was that the Vass sample was primary - that is left by her - was said in the leading judgment to be an overreach. However, this was done without the benefit of knowing the very large amount of DNA involved - I will come back to that point. 

By majority, the Appeal Court accepted, because of the evidence before it, that the DNA was left several days after Bob's disappearance at the Cleanlift boatyard.

At the heart of what I'm about to share is the new scientific evidence that supports Ms Meaghan Vass being on the yacht on the day when Bob Chappell disappeared. Ms Etter's efforts did not stop with the tabling of this report. This speech refers to the recent RTI disclosures by police and more relevant peer-reviewed scientific publications, that Ms Vass was on the yacht on Australia Day, now has hard evidence to support it, unlike the police explanation at the 2021 appeal that Ms Vass and her associates went on the yacht days later when it was under the police control at Cleanlift.

I address three topics today, they are -

The significance of the Vass DNA on the deck of the yacht;

police failing to investigate the obvious and then their failure to disclose; and 

what needs now to be done by the government.

Let's turn now to the significance of the Vass DNA on the deck of the yacht. The Vass DNA is now the critical objective evidence pointing to a murderer other than Sue Neill-Fraser. The critical errors with respect to the Vass DNA in the investigation prosecution of Ms Neill-Fraser began in March 2010 after her arrest, but months before her trial. It was then that the DNA recovered from the yacht at Cleanlift premises in January 2009 was matched to Ms Meaghan Vass.

At the 2010 trial, the Vass DNA is explained as being secondary transfer, that is it came there from someone else, possibly on the sole of a shoe and possibly via a police officer. That expert notion was nothing more than speculation. No evidence was ever led as to a known person having contact with Ms Vass, somehow requiring something which would produce a very large amount of DNA and then going on to the yacht and somehow transferring that sample to the deck. The investigating police were advised by Mr Carl Grosso[tbc] of FSST in March 2010 as follows:
Given the strong DNA profile that we obtained, I'd suggest that this is indicative of the presence of a relatively large amount of DNA, which is more likely to come from body fluids, blood, saliva, et cetera, than a simple contact or touching event.

That is an early question mark about the secondary transfer claim. It is in an official email in 2010, months before the trial.

By this time, the police and FSST were wedded to their theory that Ms Neill-Fraser was the murderer. Ms Vass's simple denial of ever going on to the yacht was convenient, as was an insertion to possibly being in the Goodwood area around the time; it was too convenient to be properly checked.

In 2021, as in 2010, the police and the prosecution were able to make an argument about the timing of deposition, even though it was fundamentally flawed because, as I will show, it both ignored available scientific evidence and published concerns and failed to follow basic lines of investigation.

A little later in this speech, I will spell out the scientific evidence available to FSST staff from 2010, including [inaudible] either not disclosed or not sufficiently researched or understood. The new scientific evidence and the recent significant scientific advances, primarily since 2021 but also earlier, rebut the police and prosecution claims that the Vass DNA was left on the yacht some days after Bob's disappearance and that someone other than Ms Vass left it. The scientific evidence put before the 2021 Appeal Court by the prosecution relating to the likely time of the DNA being left and was accepted by two of the three judges was wrong and incomplete.

The judges also did not have the important information and expert advice as to the implications of the quantity of the DNA involved - that 45 nanograms of DNA present in the 45 micro litre sample.

Justice Wood in 2021 noted that neither Mr Jones nor Ms Grosser define what they meant by a relatively large quantity of DNA. Her Honour stated that it would seem to be a relative descriptor based upon the nature of the DNA profile and the features of it, such as the good strong peak heights and factors such as dilution process. The court did not have the benefit of the actual quantity and expert opinion on the implications of that finding.

One can readily accept that new scientific discoveries can overturn what were previously accepted. This happened in the recent review of the Kathleen Folbigg case in New South Wales. Less acceptable is when available science is not found, or worse, disregarded or ignored or not disclosed, or expert advice is not shared so that the courts are misled.

What we have in the Sue Neill-Fraser case are multiple errors. Forensic scientist Max Jones, who worked at the Victorian Police Forensic Services Department, was a witness for Ms Neill-Fraser at the leave to appeal hearing in 2017. He had written expert reports in April and July 2014, including on the issue of persistence, which were in evidence. Thereafter, in 2020, FSST forensic biologist, Paul Holloway, prepared reports which inexplicably were not put to the Appellate Court. 

Both experts Holloway and Jones referred to and relied upon a short 2009 article by Dr Raymond from NSW and other Australian scientists. The abstract for the 2009 article in Forensic Science International Genetics states:

The amount of DNA recovered from the DNA source on the outdoor surfaces declined by approximately half over two weeks to a negligible amount after six weeks. Profiles could not be obtained after two weeks.

However, the short article did not contain the full details of Dr Raymond's PhD thesis, which was submitted mid-2010, the year of the trial. Contradicting his written opinion, Mr Jones gave evidence in October 2017 to the effect that the DNA sample of Meaghan Vass was so fresh that it must have been deposited in the previous one to two days after Bob Chappell's murder.

However, the Raymond thesis reported at page 151 that the decline of the trace DNA appears to follow a linear trend rather than a strong drop-off in the first few days. The linear trend has never been considered in this case. Why not? Why were Jones and Holloway not aware of this important research?

While the Raymond thesis dealt with trace DNA, the thesis experiments were conducted with a large amount of human cells and quantity of some DNA deposited in the experiment was up to 300,000 times greater than the amount left during a hand contact. In any case, both Jones and Holloway chose to rely on this study as being relevant.

Mr Jones's change of opinion at the leave to appeal should have been clarified in re-examination by reference to his written report. That wasn't done. Dr Raymond's PhD results should have been but weren't discussed at any of the 2010 trial, the later appeal, the subsequent application to be allowed to appeal again, and the 2021 appeal.

It doesn't end there. Mr Holloway of FSST wrote two versions of a report in 2020, one in March, another in June. What he wrote about the Raymond article in June 2020 report on the issue of time of deposition is as follows: 

The maximum time difference between possible times of deposition in the scenarios considered is only four days. Controlled experiments looking at the persistence of DNA outdoors, such as Raymond et al., 2009 suggests that if enough DNA is deposited, it would be possible to obtain a DNA profile like that after this time.

The Raymond et al., 2009 article is the only study that Holloway refers to in this important section of his June 2020 report. It is not mentioned in his earlier 2020 version. Maybe the failure to tender Mr Holloway's report, or call him as a witness at the 2021 appeal, was a decision made within the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP). 

What would be the reasons for this departure from expected prosecutorial conduct? Prosecutors have a duty of full disclosure to the court, even that which is contrary to the prosecution case. Whatever the reason for the failure to tender the Holloway report and call him to give evidence, it is clear from both the Jones and Holloway reports, made all the stronger by the latest published scientific papers, that Ms Vass's DNA could have been left on the deck of the yacht on Australia Day.

Further support from the Vass DNA being left on Australia Day is the length of time that saliva can last on exposed surfaces. There is a 2022 article from the International Journal of Legal Medicine. This is not mentioned in the November-tabled Etter-Selby report, which looked at the persistence of saliva cells and outdoor scenarios on soil, cloth and plastic. In outdoor scenarios the researchers observed a tipping point at an exposure time of three months. This is important, as the Holloway report states it's more likely that the source of the Vass DNA sample was saliva. Grosser also mentioned that possibility in 2010.

The published research papers since 2021 report on an exciting development with two important issues: it's called DNA transfer, persistence, prevalence and recovery (DNA-TPPR); more broadly, the time since deposition (TSD). This includes the length of time that a DNA sample can survive on a metal or steel substrate in the external environment in varying conditions. The Four Winds yacht had a metal deck. The Vass DNA was found on that deck. It was a large and strong sample; it was just not a trace that came from a policeman's shoe. 

A 2023 article in Forensic Science International by South Australian scientists examined persistence of touch DNA on commonly encountered substrates, including metal, under different storage conditions. The steel substrate-produced information, short tandem repeat (STR) profiles for the outside condition up to six months.

Emerging science was the key to overturning the convictions of Ms Kathleen Folbigg, wrongly convicted of killing her four children. At the time of her trial and for years thereafter, there was no science to refute the claim that she was a killer; now she is free, her reputation restored. As pointed out by the Australian Academy of Science after the Folby exoneration:

To ensure justice we must ensure a science-sensitive legal system. Science sensitive embraces scientific thoroughness and independence and responsiveness by the justice system.

In the Sue Neill-Fraser saga, this means looking at the 2010 trial, the 2017 leave to appeal and the 2021 appeal. Was science used appropriately? Was it reliable? An article in Forensic Science International: Genetics by Victorian scientists, including those working with Mr Jones, the Victoria Police Forensic Service Department in Melbourne at the time, published on 11 September 2017 - that is, before the expert evidence of Mr Jones in October 2017 - stated that those authorised to report on the weight of DNA evidence are frequently called upon to address questions of DNA-TPPR, that's DNA transfer, persistence, prevalence and recovery.

However, due to a lack of standardisation, knowledge and training, these questions are often addressed poorly or inadequately, thus potentially adversely impacting justice outcomes. The authors, as a result of their research, advocated that individuals should be specifically authorised to conduct analysis and provide expert opinion in criminal investigations and legal proceedings relating to DNA-TPPR. In addition, the authors stated that the depths of knowledge regarding the impact of various DNA-TPPR-related variables was incomplete but improving, and that the discipline was developing. Using an experiment when the ground truth or actual scenario is known, 29 DNA reporting scientists were tested and asked to provide opinion on DNA-TPPR in relation to six DNA profiles, with some generated via direct contact and some via indirect contact. Substantial variation was observed among participants, not only in the assessment of the type of DNA transfer but also its likelihood. In numerous instances key factors known to influence the likelihood of transfer were not considered or assumed irrelevant. Alarmingly, the percent of correct responses by any participant ranged from 11 to 67 per cent, with the average of 42 per cent.

Even to a layperson this does not seem acceptable. This research, including national guidelines on evaluative reporting published by the National Institute of Forensic Science (NIFS) in Melbourne on June 27, including authors from Victoria and Dr Duncan Taylor from South Australia, warrant a revisiting of the expert DNA evidence relied upon in this case; even more so when those concerns were repeated in an article by three of the 2017 authors and two additional experts in 2019 in Forensic Science International: Genetics. 

The abstract states that those requested to provide expert opinion on DNA-related activity level issues are often insufficiently trained to do so. The authors advocated specialised recognition of such expertise, supported by dedicated training, competency testing, authorisation and regular, fit-for-purpose proficiency testing. Even as recently as June 2025, Dr Duncan Taylor and other experts in the American Journal of Forensic Sciences referred to the evaluation of DNA given activity level propositions (EGALP), and expressed concern about opinions given in testimony that are not properly founded. 

I now turn to police failing to investigate the obvious. The second track is that the police asserted that Meaghan Vass or associates had the opportunity, in the days after Bob Chappell's disappearance, to board the yacht when it was at the Cleanlift boatyard in Goodwood. The police and prosecution assertion of an opportunity for outsiders to go on board was never supported by evidence, but it was accepted. Thanks to the material uncovered in response to the RTI request lodged by members of our parliament and police records, it is clear there was no evidence the police could use to support their claim.

Detailed chronologies in the report outline the context and sequencing of key events. There were no reported break-ins during the relevant time. There was a very narrow window of opportunity between midday 28 January 2009 and 1:40 a.m. on 30 January 2009. When the undisclosed and more recent science and the quality and quantity of DNA in the Meaghan Vass sample is coupled with the demonstration of the speculative nature of the police claim that Ms Vass or her associates were on the yacht in the days after Australia Day 2009, there is this conclusion: it is more probable than not that Ms Vass was on the yacht on Australia Day.

That is not all that this report exposes. The RTI-disclosed materials, I'm sad to say, reveal basic flaws and oversights in both the police investigation and the forensic work. Let me share some of those with you. Despite their duty to do so, the police failed to disclose to the court, the prosecution and the defence, material supportive of Ms Neill-Fraser including:

that the police searched for the yacht's missing fire extinguisher in February 2009 in the bedroom of a person suspected of stealing from boats, but strangely never mentioned that search or why they conducted it. The search is corroborated by a sworn statement by a person present at the time. That missing fire extinguisher was an early media focus and much wholly speculative use was made of it at its trial;

Meaghan Vass had several mobile phone numbers, but the police examined only one of them. This entailed that neither the prosecution nor the defence could be aware that she had more than one mobile; and 

the police failure to adequately investigate the actions, relevant histories and whereabouts of Meaghan Vass's known and suspected associates, particularly those referred to by the officer in charge, Inspector Peter Rau[tbc], who were known to steal from boats, and those she may have stayed with on and around Australia Day and several days following.

The police investigations failed to include quite basic inquiries regarding Ms Meaghan Vass's associates, and this is gobsmacking. No-one outside police has appreciated until now that there were two 'Sams' of interest, not one as previously thought. The police records indicate that no inquiries were made to one of them; inquiries of the other in 2017 were too little, too late. Either or both Sams may have found information about where Ms Vass went with whom and went on the afternoon and evening of Australia Day 2009 and the days following. Those persons whose identities in the interests of justice are suppressed in the tabled report should have been asked by police to account for their movements and provide any relevant information in the period up to the 2010 trial. Those accounts should have then been checked.

Let me turn to some additional new matters that cause concern in the handling of scientific evidence, in this case, especially with the respect to an apparent lack of accountability and transparency. A small blue towel was found on the deck of the yacht near the Meaghan Vass DNA. The item, which we know still exists, was not mentioned in the 2009 major forensic biology report, an omission still not explained despite RTI and correspondence by Robert Richter KC to the DPP Commissioner of Police and the Director of FSST. We know it was in the DNA lab in early February 2009, from disclosed records. Despite numerous requests in recent years, police are still refusing to allow an independent expert to review relevant FSST records or organise independent testing of that towel - why?

I note in passing that the government earlier this year took the commendable step in the Eden Westbrook case of legislating to ensure that autopsy photos could be obtained by the senior next of kin from the Coroners Office for independent scientific examination. Obviously, the police, too, should be required to be open and transparent with forensic evidence.

The court and Ms Neill-Fraser's lawyers were not told about a referral by FSST on activity level reporting case to an internationally respected DNA expert, Dr Duncan Taylor, at Forensic Science South Australia, 2019. Activity level reporting refers to the how and when of DNA deposition transfer, and not the who - it goes to the issue at the heart of this case. Dr Taylor holds PhDs in molecular biology and statistics. This approach to Dr Taylor was just after leave for a further appeal was granted and well before the appeal hearing. This action was only discovered this year in June, by way of a delayed external review disclosure under RTI to member Meg Webb.

A further RTI application was made on 18 September 2025 for all emails between FSST and Forensic Science South Australia personnel in relation to the DNA, in this case between May 2019 and the present. A response dated 13 November 2025, was received on 24 November 2025. An extension has been negotiated in mid-November to [Inaudible 10.09.11] provide the statement of reasons. Three pages of redacted information were disclosed, and various exemptions were applied to delete the bulk of a response by Dr Taylor to FSST on 7 June 2019. The significant redactions, around half a page, occur after a statement by Dr Taylor that there are a couple of ways that you could look at this issue. Dr Taylor then went on to say: [tbc 10.09]

So, all in all, I don't think I'm going to be able to help in this instance.

An email from FSST Biology Manager Ms Pam Scott, for Forensic Science South Australia on 30 May 2019, stated: [tbc 10.09.56]

That the contact was being made at the request of DPP discusses the possibility of Dr Taylor doing an activity level reporting analysis on the Neill-Fraser case. It further stated there was a high quality of DNA in the sample and a good DNA profile was obtained. Exemptions are then applied to the communication. No doubt if it was supportive of the prosecution case, the South Australian advice would have been disclosed. There was no mention of this contact or communication, let alone its contents in either the Holloway Reports of 2020 or the FSST [inaudible] case notes released under a 152-page supplementary RTI internal review to member Meg Webb. There are no entries for the period between 4 April and 5 September 2019.

The question should be asked, will the government, in the interests of justice and in accordance with ongoing disclosure requirements, immediately release the full emails between the FSST and Dr Duncan Taylor from Forensic Science in South Australia?

Now I will quickly outline what needs to be done by the government. The contents of the report tabled in November, supplemented by the additional material touching as they do upon important, complex and emerging science, the apparent withholding of relevant science at the 2021 appeal, fundamental omissions from the police investigations and non-disclosures, and concerns about the reliability of expert evidence in DNA TPPR all combined to make a strong argument that Sue Neill-Fraser deserves yet another opportunity to appeal.

Such opportunity should be facilitated and not ignored and not slowed down by this government. Fighting a case like this is a David and Goliath battle. The resources of the state are overwhelming in comparison. It follows that the Attorney-General should provide special funding to Legal Aid to ensure the retention of experienced and independent criminal appellate lawyers who can and will act swiftly on Sue's behalf.

In the normal course, the Attorney-General could direct our DPP to take the appropriate action to facilitate leave to appeal and swiftly bring the matter before the appellate court. However, given the contents of both the latest information and the 2021 Etter-Selby papers, especially as those touched upon non-disclosure of material to Ms Neill-Fraser's lawyers and the failure to call Mr Holloway, [inaudible 10.12.38] his report, it would be more appropriate for the Attorney-General to brief outside counsel.

I note, too, that conditions of Ms Neill-Fraser's parole prevent her from communicating directly or indirectly to third parties to assert claims of innocence or wrongful conviction. Such a restriction, in the light of this report, will be seen by right-thinking people to be an unreasonable fetter. I hope the Attorney-General will take immediate steps to have that condition removed. Without that restriction, Ms Neill-Fraser might have joined her supporters in the gallery today.

Earlier I mentioned that the government needed to pursue two responses. The first and most urgent is facilitating a further leave to appeal by Ms Neill-Fraser. The second is an appropriately resourced and empowered inquisitorial inquiry to get the bottom of what, on the face of it, seems to be too many problems with the investigation, the forensics, the prosecution and the appeals. Appropriate independent expert opinion is needed in that regard.

The history of the Sue Neill-Fraser matter shows that we in Tasmania need to take steps to justify community confidence and trust in our criminal justice system.

How would any one of us feel if today we were not talking about Sue Neill-Fraser, but about a member of our family or a dear friend? We must, each and every one of us, press for immediate action to give Sue Neill-Fraser, her family and the Chappell family a decision based on sound evidence. We must also press for action to improve standards within our criminal justice system so there is justice for all. I ask that the report and executive summary be considered and noted.

[10.14 p.m.]
Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, I rise to make a contribution in support of this important motion. I do so as I have been seriously disturbed by the circumstantial case against Ms Sue Neill-Fraser. I acknowledge it has disturbed many for some time now. I don't know the truth of it, but when I hear the story I find it disturbing. I commend our colleague, the member for Mersey, for tabling the Etter-Selby report on 12 November and which is the subject of the motion before us. This report highlights the range of serious issues concerning Ms Neill-Fraser's conviction as well as the subsequent leave to appeal and appeal processes in more recent years.

I also acknowledge the ongoing truth-seeking contributions of the honourable Andrew Wilkie, Senator Jacqui Lambie and the member for Clark, Kristie Johnston MP. Put simply, the Etter-Selby report argues a possible miscarriage of justice has occurred, resulting in the incarceration for 13 years of a potentially innocent woman. These serious concerns strike at the very heart of our legal system. Our justice system cannot operate without the trust and confidence of our community and, sadly, we do know miscarriages of justice have occurred in Australia.

I refer to Lindy Chamberlain in the Northern Territory, to Edward Splatt in South Australia, Andrew Mallard in Western Australia, Kathleen Folbigg in New South Wales and Gordon Wood in New South Wales, to mention those concerning situations which are probably best known perhaps to the general community. Such cases are notorious for involving failed appeals. Chamberlain, for instance, endured failed appeals in both the Federal Court and the High Court.

Common key causal factors in such tragedies often include things such as police tunnel vision, police and prosecutorial misconduct, unreliable or flawed forensic evidence, and inadequate legal representation. Based on what we have heard today regarding the Etter-Selby papers tabled in this place, as well as additional scientific papers and more recent discoveries concerning forensic science issues under RTI from police, there are real questions about potentially the integrity, independence and impartiality of our forensic science services. There are also potential concerns regarding the investigative competency and integrity of some in Tasmania Police.

I'm deeply concerned by the time, resources and tactics that appear to have been misused seeking to stifle probing for truth and to maintain this conviction almost at any cost - it would appear on the face of the evidence compiled and tabled in this place. The Etter-Selby report argues there is now a credible, reasonable hypothesis pointing to someone other than Ms Sue Neill-Fraser being involved in the death of Mr Bob Chappell on Australia Day 2009.

That hypothesis is based on the following eight elements: one, a large and strong sample of Ms Vass's DNA, more likely in saliva, was found on the metal deck of the Four Winds yacht when it was being forensically examined at Cleanlift in the early hours of 30 January 2009. 

Two, the science tells us that saliva can last a long time and provide a protective environment for DNA. 

Three, the relevant science also tells us that DNA degradation on external surfaces is linear, not sudden, contrary to expert evidence provided in 2017. 

Four, the police and prosecution have maintained that the Vass DNA was brought onto the yacht by someone other than Ms Vass. However, there has not been any evidence provided pointing to any person who might have done that. Instead, the argument relies upon speculation.

Five, the police and prosecution also stated that there were break-ins at Cleanlift prior to the DNA sample being collected early on 30 January. Apparently such break-in activity would allow for the DNA to be left by Ms Vass or one of her associates at the time, yet the police records of ongoing activities on the yacht and reported break-ins around that time offer no support for that speculation. 

Six, having shown the claims of secondary and/or later DNA deposition to have no proper evidential basis, we are left with the objective science, which is a very large DNA sample, 45 nanograms- as stated in the 2020 Holloway report- in saliva was found on the metal deck, degrading in a lengthy linear manner.

Seven, in a nutshell, it can be argued that a defence claim that Ms Vass was on the Four Winds on Australia Day is a much stronger hypothesis than the police and prosecution assertions that she was not. 

Eight, it can also be argued it does not matter anymore whether Ms Vass asserts that she was or was not on the yacht: The science may be assessed as more compelling than her changeable statements.

The law is clear. Where the defence offers a reasonable, credible hypothesis pointing to possible or probable innocence, there can be no conviction. This is because, for any fact finder, be it a jury or a judge, there must no reasonable doubt. In the clear, bright light of this new science outlined in the Etter-Selby report and the member for Mersey's speech in this Chamber, it's time to ask, have the police and the prosecution been keen to keep important matters hidden? Why has it taken over three years of RTI investigation to finally reveal some aspects of this matter?

Frankly, I can attest that the RTI experience alone has been like pulling teeth. The delays, the obstruction and the applied exemptions and the accompanying excuses have been frustrating, to say the least. If all was above board, wouldn't police be keen to share the evidence with the public, including concerned members of parliament?

Critical new, relevant matters have only emerged because I was compelled to push very hard for an internal review on one of my 2023 applications. Despite lengthy delays, this resulted in what was to prove to be an enlightening discovery in 2025 regarding the Forensic Science Services Tasmania (FSST) seeking advice in mid 2019. That's before Ms Neill-Fraser's appeal from the highly respected Dr Duncan Taylor at Forensic Science South Australia.

January 2026, in a couple of months, will mark three years since I submitted my first RTI application to police regarding the small blue towel found on the deck of the yacht not far from the Meaghan Vass DNA sample. This blue towel apparently disappeared from the major forensic biology report of July 2009, still without explanation to date. We know it was in the DNA lab in early February 2009, but there are still no disclosed records as to how it was handled, treated or examined.

The authorities are steadfastly refusing to allow access to relevant records by an independent forensic expert or to allow access for independent testing. We need post-conviction DNA testing legislation as it exists in jurisdictions such as the USA. This case is a serious matter that demands urgent action from the government. We cannot have a police service that can ignore accountability.

Let me state some examples of failures of our system. First, the failure to tender FSSTs Mr Holloway's June 2020 report at the 2021 appeal, which contained the quantity of DNA involved and the opinion that the more likely source of the DNA was saliva, along with the statement that it was possible that the Meaghan Vass DNA was deposited on Australia Day 2009 and not days later.

Second, the failure to call Mr Holloway as a witness at the 2021 appeal. 

Third, the failure of forensic experts to include in their report references or texts or in evidence pertinent scientific advances or concerns that were available in the literature. 

Fourth, the failure of FSST and its experts since the appellate decision in November 2021 to share or disclose the information that its DNA experts must have acquired about the evolving DNA science. DNA, TPPR, time since deposition, TSD and EGALP that pointed to past errors and cast doubt on the Neill-Fraser conviction

Fifth, the ongoing failure of SST to disclose its interactions with the internationally respected and eminently qualified Dr Duncan Taylor, even as late as last week in an RTI response to me. That's 12 days after the tabling of the recent Etter-Selby report. As one of those parliamentarians who has made RTI requests to Tasmania Police about their investigation and conduct in the Neill-Fraser case, that experience has raised serious questions about the potential for the misuse of RTI processes to thwart openness and accountability.

Here is what I was told in writing by Tasmania Police in a letter dated 13 November 2025 but received last week on 24 November 2025 after they negotiated extra time to work on their statement of reasons.

The exemption that was claimed to justify the redaction of Dr Taylor's actual advice on the issue was a section 34 of the Right to Information Act 2009 regarding information communicated by other jurisdictions. Such information is said to be exempt if its disclosure would prejudice relations between two or more states, or the information was communicated in confidence by another state and its disclosure would reasonably likely to impair the ability of a public authority to obtain similar information in the future.

This reasoning is inapplicable and possibly absurd. How can it prejudice relations between Tasmania and South Australia to share valuable up-to-date science? How can disclosure impair the ability of our FSST to stay connected to evolving science and ensure justice in a high-profile murder case or any other case? To those queries, I would add that my understanding is that the duty of disclosure by police and the Crown is ongoing, especially in a highly contested murder conviction.

Contrary to what is argued, I believe that the failure to be open about the interactions with Dr Taylor could be damaging to our relationship with Forensic Science SA. Forensic Science SA may have assumed that the information provided to FSST would have been dealt with ethically, professionally and in accordance with legal obligations, but the seemingly nonsensical RTI response to keep Dr Taylor's communication hidden is not an isolated instance; in fact, far from it.

There have been complete refusals under RTI to a range of requests on this case, including by Andrew Wilkie in August 2021. For example, I'm aware Mr Wilkie MP sought a range of critical information concerning Meaghan Vass, including important police documents which led Inspector Peter Powell to make a comment about Meaghan Vass and her associates and stealing from boats. The asserted justification for a total refusal - in a record eight days, I might add - was on the basis that the majority of the information was in the possession of the office of the DPP and therefore exempt from disclosure under section 6 of the act, and the matter remained under appeal and that the remainder of the information sought formed part of ongoing investigations into the matter which may be presented before a court at a future date. 

This raises questions over what they had in mind about a future court date; the appeal had been heard in March 2021. If the material was in the possession of the DPP and the case was live, then that raises the fundamental legal issue of why it was not disclosed to Ms Neill-Fraser's lawyers. When trying to RTI the case of the small blue towel, there was an attempt to completely refuse, quite wrongly, the initial application by invoking section 19 of the Right to Information Act regarding requests which were claimed to unreasonably divert resources and involve voluminous materials. I eventually got some disclosures, but there were months of delays. 

There were also a number of outstanding issues in this case, including concerns over the apparent lost and contaminated red jacket. It appears it was lost in the police car park for three days, which was misrepresented at trial as an exhibit of integrity with a proper chain of custody. The apparent misleading of the court about the luminol and supposed blood in the dinghy relating to the Crown's theory of body disposal: there was no confirmed blood in the Four Winds dinghy, and concerns over the apparent misleading statement by the DPP to the court in closing comments at the appeal. When questioned by Justice Estcourt about Mr Conde's evidence concerning the grey dinghy seen by him alongside the Four Winds that afternoon. As a result, Justice Wood in her judgment stated that Mr Conde's description was explicable as an honest mistake.

However, Mr Conde's detailed description of what he saw, which was not put to Justice Estcourt, makes it clear that Mr Conde saw a dinghy that was not the Four Winds Quicksilver dinghy. I urge fellow members to also consider the earlier Etter-Selby papers tabled by the member for Mersey in this place in August 2021 and his previous speech in August 2023. Knowing, as we do now, the growing concerns and the assertions that Ms Sue Neill-Fraser was not responsible for Mr Bob Chappell's death and the possibility that Ms Vass knows who was, combined with the series of refusals and claims for exemption under RTI, is deeply concerning. 

The case for an in-depth examination of this conviction is now overwhelming, particularly so when there are persons of interest and known associates of Meaghan Vass who, it would appear, were never properly investigated despite apparent police knowledge of their involvement in boat crimes. Why weren't such associations disclosed to the court? The long list of apparent non-disclosures in this case is frightening, including the issue of the search for the supposedly missing fire extinguisher from the Four Winds at the home of a well-known boat thief, only a couple of weeks after Mr Chappell's disappearance, and information obtained in recent years under RTI about the surrounding circumstances.

If it isn't bad enough that our mortuary/autopsy services are not accredited by the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA), additionally Tasmania Police is the only police agency in Australia to not have its police forensic services, including crime scene investigations, tool marks, ballistics, et cetera, accredited with NATA. FSST also only has basic NATA accreditation and is not accredited by the Australian Forensic Standards. Tasmania's limited forensic services accreditation does little to assist in restoring public confidence in our criminal justice and judicial system.

I call upon the government, in the interests of justice, to immediately release the advice from Dr Duncan Taylor from Forensic Services SA of June 2019, along with all communications between him and any officer of FSST, Tasmania Police and the office of the DPP about the Vass DNA.

Identifying and rectifying a miscarriage of justice in Australia is seriously challenging. It's difficult to fund legal advice, assess critical information, and to even obtain independent forensic advice when authorities will not disclose records or provide access to an exhibit for independent testing. We know that there are miscarriages of justice that can and do occur. On 7 February 1986, almost 40 years ago, Lindy Chamberlain was released from prison and an inquiry was announced after the discovery of new forensic evidence, namely the matinee jacket. Both Ms Chamberlain's release and the call for an inquiry occurred on the very same day. The Morling Inquiry reported in 1987 - systematically demolishing so much of the forensic science and expert evidence.

In this case, too, there is a litany of forensic science concerns, in addition to the revelations about the Meaghan Vass DNA. These concerns include the potentially misleading evidence about the luminol and supposed blood in the Four Winds dinghy; the unscientific and flawed so-called winching reconstruction, purporting to show how Ms Neill-Fraser single-handedly winched Mr Chappell's body up from below the deck and into a dinghy; the red jacket which was lost in the police car park and contaminated with someone else's DNA, but presented as an exhibit of integrity at the trial; and undisclosed DNA results from a range of additional testing done by FSST, including the testing of the hair found near the steps in the yacht upon which Mr Chappell's blood was found, only revealed under RTI, but with any outcome redacted.

The highly regarded 1987 Morling Inquiry tellingly concluded this, at page 340-341:

With the benefit of hindsight, it can be seen that some experts who gave evidence were overconfident of their ability to form reliable opinions on matters that lay on the outer margins of their fields of expertise. Some of their opinions were based on unreliable and inadequate data. It was not until more research work had been done after the trial that some of these opinions were found to be of doubtful validity or wrong.

Other evidence was given at the trial by experts who did not have the experience, facilities or resources necessary to enable them to express a reliable opinion on some of the novel and complex scientific issues which arose for consideration. It was necessary for much more research to be done on these matters to determine whether the opinions expressed at the trial were open to doubt.

Those comments in 1987 reflect with uncanny resemblance what may have happened in this case in relation to expert DNA evidence, and the issue of DNA-TPPR and time since deposition, as reflected in the concerns expressed by respected experts in international journals and outlined by the member for Mersey here today. There are also serious doubts about the validity and reliability of expert evidence provided to the court in 2017.

This is a complex and emerging science and as in the Folbigg case, the safety of the conviction should now be examined carefully. Steps must now be taken by the state government to get this matter back before a suitably constituted court with appropriate legal support for Ms Neill-Fraser, and to independently investigate whether and what, if anything, went horribly wrong. Justice demands it. To close, I thank the honourable member for Mersey once again, for providing this Chamber with the opportunity as well as the responsibility to consider this significant matter. It has serious implications for a particular individual, Ms Neill-Fraser, but it also has serious implications for the broader community and its confidence in our justice system. On that, I support the motion.

[10.34 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, thank you. I will be making a very brief contribution. I acknowledge the honourable member for Mersey's longstanding interest in the matter and also acknowledge Susan Neill-Fraser's supporters who are  in the Chamber with us this evening. The government notes that this matter has been subject to court proceedings and, with the greatest of respect, does not believe that there is a need for an inquiry; the government also notes that the report and the executive summary is noted. Thank you.

[10.35 p.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - Mr President, I thank the member for Nelson for her contribution. It was not an unexpected response from the government. However, just in closing I believe the Chamberlain and Neill-Fraser cases have some key points in common:

Both led to polarised views about guilt or innocence.
Both involved expert forensic evidence.
Both led to committed groups pursuing their doubts about the conviction in the face of concerted efforts to silence them following the convictions being confirmed by the appellate courts.

Polarising is not surprising. We expect our police, our forensic experts, our prosecutors and defence lawyers to act competently in accordance with justice and guidelines and with integrity to produce the correct result.

It is important that we, as elected representatives, can express and discuss the polarisation and the causes for it.

This public airing is an important part of community and trust in our criminal justice system. I believe we want to believe in our system. We want to believe that we don't make mistakes because we don't want to see innocent people put away. Chamberlain, as we all remember, was a national and international case, and so many years after her supposed guilt by fresh scientific evidence and DNA, they were able to realise that she was innocent.

Now it's not to say that anybody wants to make a mistake, but in this case with Sue Neill-Fraser, it is obvious to me from the papers I've read, from the communications I've had and the phone calls I've received that there is more to this case than meets the eye. We must ensure that that lady, a member of our community, is able to receive the attention that she deserves, so tomorrow morning I will be asking this place that we consider a notice of motion to be debated next year about an independent inquiry for Sue Neill-Fraser. I am sending that to you now - I wasn't going to - so you have time to think about this overnight from the evidence you've heard and from what we know.

I thank all those who have contributed to this debate.

It is confronting to be faced with evidence that our expectations have not been met. It requires us all to move from a comfortable belief that all is well to the unpleasant realisation that serious mistakes were made, the cumulative effect of which is a miscarriage of justice.

In the Sue Neill-Fraser case, the totality of the evidence gathered from police, RTI disclosures, analysis of past and recent scientific advances and the work of lawyer Etter and barrister Hugh Selby over many years means that we've moved beyond suspicions that not all is well to the certainty that the government must move quickly to bring her case before the Court of Criminal Appeal.

I should also comment the last time I raised the Selby issue some years ago, I arrived home that night after being here presenting. I usually don't answer phone calls that are private or unknown, but I did. I had a pen and paper there. I had this voice, and the voice said to me, 'Are you that Gaffney fella?' and I said, 'Yes, that's me.' he said, 'Are you the one who's just done this Sue Neill-Fraser thing at that parliament?', I said 'Yes' and he said 'Well, I've got something I need to tell you' and he gave the name of a person who he said his girlfriend had known was the killer of Bob Chappell. My response, and I've not mentioned this to anybody else, but I think this is how important I believe this is to be - I rang the commissioner who was Darren Hine at the time and I said, 'This is the phone call, this is what I've received, what do I do?' and he said somebody will ring you within five minutes and that happened. I feel that is important information because that name was given to me and the police were aware of that name.

In closing, it is telling that in the near three weeks since I tabled the Etter-Selby report that there has been science from the police and the ODPP. It is telling not only because they may have no answer, it is also telling because being able to own up to a mistake is one of the hardest things to do. Rather than belatedly joining in a quest for truth and justice, the latest example of bunkering down is the police RTI response last week to the member Meg Webb, refusing to disclose the full exchange of Dr Duncan Taylor, of Forensics South Australia that predates the 2021 appeal. In the face of such determined intransigence and a commitment to keeping the lid on, there's only one solution I believe, a wide-ranging powerful commission of inquiry so that this matter can be fully resolved. I move my notice of motion.

Motion agreed to.


ADJOURNMENT

[10.42 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move -

That the Council at its rising adjourn until 10.00 a.m on Wednesday 3 December 2025.

Motion agreed to.

Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, before I move that the Council does now adjourn, I just wish to advise members that departmental officers will be available to answer any questions on the State Policies and Projects (Macquarie Point Precinct) Order of 2025 in Committee Room 2 from 9.00 a.m. tomorrow, should members choose to take that opportunity.

Mr President, I move -

That the Council do now adjourn.

[10.43 p.m.]
Mr DUIGAN (Windermere - Minister for Sport) - Mr President, I thank the Chamber for its indulgence. I'd like to make a clarifying statement on answers I gave in both budget Estimates and in the House of Assembly this morning. In answer to a question from Mr Winter in budget Estimates, I said the following: [tbc 10.42]

I believe Mr Hall shortly after I sent him that letter went out and stood next to you, as you provided an alternative for him. On the basis of that, I chose not to sign my letter.

On reflection, I should have clarified that what I meant by this was that I didn't sign the letter on the basis that the club had made clear they had an alternate proposal to the one we had been discussing, and the one I had articulated in my draft letter to the president.

It was not my intention in my actions during the campaign, nor in the statements I've made since, that I didn't sign the letter because Mr Hall stood with Mr Winter during the campaign. It was, as I have said in the media appearance, the club clearly indicated it had a preference for a particular course of action that wasn't reflected in the draft letter I had sent to the president.

I regret that my answers may have given the North Launceston Football Club or the public the impression that I would seek to punish the club in the decisions I make for meeting with other members of parliament, as is their clear right. My absolute focus is to find an outcome for the club that is mutually agreeable and beneficial. Again, I thank the Chamber for its indulgence.

The Council adjourned at 10.44 p.m.
