RESPONSE TO PETITON

Macquarie Point Stadium - Planning Commission Process

[11.01 a.m.]
Mr VINCENT (Prosser - Deputy Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council) (by leave) - Mr President, I have the honour to table the government's response to the member for Hobart's Petition No. 48 regarding enabling legislation for the proposed Macquarie Point stadium.


			QUESTION ON NOTICE - ANSWER
		
		No. 5 - Macquarie Point Redevelopment
		
		[11.15 a.m.]
		Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I have the answer to Question on Notice No. 5 from the member for Elwick, Ms Thomas:
		
		Have all six Performance Milestones under the Macquarie Point Urban Redevelopment Federation Funding Agreement - Infrastructure schedule been met? 
	
		Is the Housing Plan publicly available? If not, when will it be released?
		
		Has the $240 million federal funding contribution been received? If not, when does the government expect to receive it?
		
		Given the agreement does not mention a stadium, how does the government justify its stated intention to apply federal funds to this purpose?
		
		Outside of any stadium investment, what specific investment does the government intend to make in delivering the projects required under the additional terms of the agreement, being:
		
			Clause 1.i - produce a refreshed precinct plan for the Macquarie Point site;
			
			Clause 1.ii - engage with the community and all affected stakeholders;
		
			Clause 1.iii - maintain and enhance existing amenities at Regatta Point;
		
			Clause 1.iv - upgrade Macquarie Wharf, with immediate priority to Wharf 6;
		
			Clause 1.v - deliver upgrades to wharves 4 and 5;
		
			Clause 1.vi - ensure the delivery of housing at Macquarie Point, including affordable, essential worker or social housing.
		
		Will these investments be incorporated into the 2025-26 Budget and forward Estimates?
	
		What accountability or clawback mechanisms apply if the Performance Milestones and additional terms are not met? 
		
		What proportion of the $240 million federal contribution is the government allocating to each element of the Precinct Plan (stadium, housing, wharf upgrades, public/community amenities), and will Treasury publish a breakdown of this allocation?
		
		ANSWER
		
		The Tasmanian government is working to complete the performance milestones under the Macquarie Point Urban Redevelopment Federation Funding Agreement - Infrastructure Schedule (FFA). Milestones one, two and three are complete. Milestones four and five are expected to be completed by the end of this year. Milestone six was impacted by the 2025 state election and is expected to be completed shortly after the remaining milestones have been completed.
		
		The housing plan, milestone five, has been informed by market sounding and feedback from the Commonwealth. The plan is consistent with the approach set out in the precinct plan, which was informed by public consultation and recent engagement with industry stakeholders on the master plan development. The plan will be publicly released after formal acceptance is received by the Australian government.
		
		The Australian Government funding associated with the FFA is not yet scheduled to be received. As is standard practice, performance milestones for individual payments will be outlined by the Australian Government following the completion of other milestones. Funding for the Australian Government's commitment under the FFA have been confirmed in the 2025-26 Commonwealth budget. Importantly, the cash flow set out in the FFA and in the Australian Government's budget are based on the cash flow required for the delivery and construction of the stadium. Tasmania's Department of Treasury and Finance has also estimated the financial year cash flows for the payment of these funds in the 2025-26 interim Budget.
		The purpose of the FFA is clear. That is to support the delivery of the urban redevelopment of the Macquarie Point precinct in Hobart. The Tasmanian government's vision for the Macquarie Point urban renewable project includes a multi-purpose stadium at its core. The Prime Minister has also publicly confirmed that these funds are available to support the delivery of the stadium.
		
		The Tasmanian government together with the Macquarie Point Development Corporation and TasPorts is working to ensure that Tasmania can deliver on its commitments under the FFA:
		
			The requirements of clause 1.i and 1.ii are being met through existing resources and the Macquarie Point Development Corporation.
			
			The upgrades to wharves 4, 5 and 6 are managed by TasPorts, with the upgrade to Wharf 6 being the subject of a separate FFA (clauses 1.iv and 1.v).
		
			MPDC will be progressing with the delivery of housing at Macquarie Point including affordable essential workers or social housing as a commercial activation of the broader precinct. The commercial redevelopment opportunities, including housing and public amenities at Regatta Point will be supported by land release strategy and taken to market to develop. (Clauses 1.iii and 1.iv).
		
		Similar to the 2024-25 Budget, the 2025-26 State Budget will include detail on the Macquarie Point Urban Renewal project as well as the upgrades to Macquarie Wharf 6 over the Budget and forward Estimates.
		
		As noted in response (3), the performance milestones for payments are to be negotiated between the Australian and Tasmanian governments. Generally, the Australian Government releases payments to the states once certain milestones have been achieved. This FFA will be no different.
		
		Once received, the $240 million contribution from the Australian Government will be used to progress the urban redevelopment at Macquarie Point. As you would be aware, the stadium is at the core of the precinct and will be developed first before the balance of the precinct is developed. The budget papers will provide information on the use of these funds and the Macquarie Point Development Corporation's annual report will also show how these funds have been applied.

RECOGNITION OF VISITORS
[11.25 a.m.]
Mr PRESIDENT - Before I call on Special Interest Matters, I welcome the second group from Sacred Heart College who are joining us in the Chamber today. We're currently going through our formal business before we go into Special Interest Matters and then we will go on with some other business. It's been a little while since we've been in here, so we've got a lot of things to catch up on. I know that all members will join me in welcoming you to the parliament and thanking you for taking great interest in the democratic processes of this state.

Members - Hear, hear.

Mr PRESIDENT - Special Interest time: our first member to contribute will be the honourable member for Nelson, who has some guests that I'd also like to welcome to the Chamber today that have been sitting very patiently as we went through all the bits and pieces. I'd like to welcome Brigid Wilkinson, CEO of Council on the Ageing Tasmania (COTA), who is probably well known to us all.

Rosary Gardens residents: (names TBC) Anne and Frank; Liz McDermott, a teacher; students: Vladimir Kelly, Harvey Pyefinch, Liam Haynes, Daisy Barnes, Sophie Skeggs and Jasmine Williams. To tell us why they're here, the honourable member for Nelson.


SPECIAL INTEREST MATTERS

Generations Connect: Tech Together Program

[11.26 a.m.]
Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, it is such a pleasure to rise today to speak about a program in our community that is utterly delightful and genuinely life-changing: COTA's Generations Connect: Tech Together Program.

Most of us here will be familiar with the challenges we face when seeking to foster social cohesion, respect, and inclusion in our community. For some, the key challenge is ensuring they don't fade into invisibility, or not be left behind, disconnected and alienated from participating in the community.

We know technology and technological advances can be a double-edged sword in this way. It can foster immediate and greater connection for some, while entrenching a sense of isolation and disconnect for others. The digital divide is of particular concern for many older Tasmanians, and that is where we see the brilliance of this groundbreaking, intergenerational digital inclusion initiative called Generations to Connect: Tech Together.

This inspirational program is led by Council on the Ageing, known to many as COTA, and that brings together young people and older Tasmanians in a unique, intergenerational learning environment. During the annual Seniors Week last month, I had the pleasure of attending the launch of a locally-made film showcasing the life-changing impact of this inspirational and innovative program. I attended along with COTA Tasmania patron, Governor, Her Excellency the Honourable Barbara Baker AC; the State Minister for Ageing, the Honourable Bridget Archer MP; as well as an audience of young people, older Tasmanians, family, friends, and community members.

There was so much affection and humour in the room. I know we were all extremely impressed by the genuine engagement, interest, warmth, and caring demonstrated by all participants, young and not so young. In an increasingly digital world, access to technology is essential for staying connected, informed and independent. This innovative program seeks to address the digital divide while simultaneously tackling social isolation, ensuring that both younger and older generations feel valued, capable, and connected.

It does this in structured weekly sessions over an eight-to-ten-week period in residential aged care homes or community venues where students, who take on the role of digital mentors, meet one to one with older adults to explore digital devices, apps, and online tools in a supportive, patient and social setting. These young digital mentors include those from secondary school, college, university and home school students.

Together they meet weekly with older Tasmanians living in residential aged care homes to learn, laugh, and share skills that improve digital confidence, well-being, and intergenerational understanding. They also do a range of other enjoyable activities together to build understanding and relationships among the group. Certainly, in the film, the enjoyment factor that was there in these interactions shone through. In term 3 this year alone, 120-plus young digital mentors trained in the south of the state, with programs running in multiple residential aged care homes. The impact of those three months is already having a positive ripple effect. Residents experienced increased confidence and independence with technology and a sense of achievement in learning new skills.

Crucially, the program reduces isolation through digital communication with friends and family, while also providing invaluable enjoyment and stimulation from the intergenerational connection. The young digital mentors learn practical teaching, volunteering and mentoring experience while growing in empathy, patience, leadership and communication skills. In fact, the program can even open up career paths for the young people involved, with at least one participant recently taking up, I believe, a traineeship at one of the residential facilities, an option that she perhaps had not previously considered prior to participating in the program.

The broader community also benefits from this shared understanding of ageing, resilience and community, particularly in the forging of stronger intergenerational bonds which help break down stereotypes about age, whichever end of Father Time's calendar you currently sit on. I recommend honourable members check out the film about this program if they haven't already, available on COTA's YouTube platform, and explore the program which may benefit many in our respective communities. 

The heartwarming film demonstrates that learning is cross-generational. Students assisted in very practical ways to reconnect residents with loved ones via text, video calls or emails. In turn, students gained adoptive grandparents, if you will, who shared wisdom, stories and encouragement. I hope that this transformative program continues to grow as COTA rolls out further programs over the next 12 months. I particularly hope to see the initial two-year funding of the program continued and expanded. It's clearly demonstrating vast benefits.

To close, I wish to congratulate COTA and all involved in delivering such a life-changing program as generations connect tech together. I specifically wish to congratulate COTA CEO, Brigid Wilkinson[checked but others TBC], who's in the Chamber today, along with Rosary Gardens residents: Frank - I believe Anne was to be here, but perhaps she's not available today after all. We send our wishes to Anne as well. Also, Liz McDermott, a key inspirational teacher supporting the program, and participating young digital mentors who are here with us today, including Vladimir Kelly, Harvey Pyefinch, Liam Haynes, Daisy Barnes, Sophie Skeggs, and Jasmine Williams.

A big shout-out, as well, to the program coordinator, Mel Knuckey [checked], who unfortunately could not be here today, because she's out busy on location delivering the program. Generations Connect: Tech Together [checked] is more than just a digital literacy program; it's a movement that builds bridges across generations. It reminds us that when young and old come together, everyone learns, everyone grows, lifelong friendships form and our communities become stronger, resilient and more compassionate. I know everyone here will join me in congratulating all those who brought this beautiful program to life in our community.




International Men's Day

[11.33 a.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - Thank you, Mr President. I would like to again focus on men's health and wellbeing, and in particular, International Men's Day (IMD). IMD is globally recognised on 19 November. This year's Australian theme is supporting men and boys. A key aim of IMD is to highlight various social issues that men and boys face, such as boys struggling at school or men grappling with their mental health. My fellow honourable members may recall that I have referenced IMD and men's health and wellbeing more broadly a number of times in this place, in an effort to highlight the inequity of funding and the underrepresentation of men's health and wellbeing resources in this state.

I'm pleased to say that Tasmania has a number of grassroots and community-based initiatives that work to reach men. A few have some level of funding, including the Men's Table and Men's Sheds, but the vast majority operate through volunteer passion and commitment. These include Men Care Too, Man Up Tasmania, Tassie Blokes Speak, Building Pathways and Men's Resources Tasmania (MRT).

MRT, a community-based, not-for-profit organisation that actively supports and promotes the wellbeing of men and boys in Tasmania, has recently articulated some real and valid concerns to me. MRT currently convenes the Tasmanian Men's Health Network, which meets bimonthly and is well-placed to play a coordinating role in Tasmanian men's health and wellbeing issues. However, it is evident and disheartening that energy and finances to support their ongoing efforts are dwindling. MRT notes the lack of funding and paid positions mean they cannot contribute local male perspectives into consultation network meetings, forums, expos and events. 

Whilst there are indeed men in attendance at these events, they often don't have a male focus or a deeper understanding about the needs and concerns of males, and the policy experience and expertise to bring nuanced and detailed contributions.

The recently held National Men's Health Gathering 2025 in Brisbane, organised by the Australian Men's Health Forum (AMHF), is the largest and only male health-focused conference in Australia. Conference attendees heard from various academics and other experts about the need for:

state-based men's health policies that build on and fund the work of the national men's strategy;

state-based strategies to address male suicide; and

coordinated approaches to grassroots and community-based initiatives that work to reach men.

Mr President, international best practice informs us that one of the key areas to improve men's access to healthcare is by developing male-friendly services. In 2020, the AMHF published a wonderful document - Making Services Work for Men: A 10-Step Guide to Developing Male-Friendly Health Services. Indeed, I encourage members and those in the healthcare industry to consider the information in that document, and that can be applied universally to a general population of men as well as being tailored to the diverse needs and preferences of different populations. 

We know statistically that males experience poor health outcomes in many areas. The lack of male-focused service in Tasmania further stigmatises men at a time when the call for men to open up, speak up and be vulnerable is only getting louder.

As the Tasmanian government calls for budget submissions and considers its 2026-27 allocations, it is clearly time, and dare I suggest long overdue, for an investment in men's health. Any dollar spent in men's wellbeing is an investment in the community. 

One of the ways I'm personally supporting International Men's Day is by hosting a free, family-fun picnic day, 'BBQ at Bellsy', on Sunday 16 November from 12.00 to 2.30 p.m. at Bells Parade in Latrobe. This free community event will have sporting activities, live music, a barbecue lunch, coffee and ice-cream vans, community group displays, health checks, car displays, sword-fighting display, and even a Westie Rescue and Rehoming Tasmania Fun Day. 

For those who are not aware, Bells Parade is a tranquil and picturesque location situated on the Latrobe inlet of the Mersey River. Indeed, I have many fond memories of my wedding 35 years ago at Bells Parade. However, my wife Mel may wish she had chosen to walk the dog and have a barbecue instead. 

In closing, there are many ways in which to recognise International Men's Day, so why not consider how you can support the men and boys in your life? It could be something as simple as reaching out to a loved one, checking in on an acquaintance, or just being there for a young male person who needs guidance or support. 


The Valley Network

[11.38 a.m.]
Ms PALMER (Rosevears - Minister for Children and Youth) - Mr President, as the mother of three sons I thank the member for Mersey for that contribution. You've been a wonderful advocate in the men's space for some time, and my sons will be better off for it. 

It is an honour and a privilege to speak today about a wonderful organisation in my electorate of Rosevears - the Valley Network. The Valley Network is a community outreach organisation that's deeply rooted in the heart of the West Tamar region. Originally known as the Caring Network, the Valley Network is an initiative of the Valley Church in Exeter, which has just celebrated its 40th anniversary, so congratulations to them. The Valley Network has remained steadfast in its mission to serve individuals and families in need with compassion, dignity and practical support.

Over the past two decades, the Valley Network's reach has grown from Riverside to Frankford to Greens Beach and everything in between, offering emergency relief services including fuel, food vouchers and also assistance with household expenses. These services are not just lifelines in that moment, but expressions of care. It's about letting people know that they are visible and that their problems can be shared. This work is made possible through great partnerships, including with The Salvation Army, Loaves & Fishes Tasmania, and Banjo's Bakery Café, which see weekly donations of fresh produce and bread that are then used right across the community.

The Valley Network also operates op shops, powered by the goodwill of local donors and amazing volunteers. The proceeds directly fund numerous welfare programs. Beyond emergency relief, we have programs which have a real community focus, like cooking classes using the fresh ingredients from the kitchen garden, workshops on how to budget and craft activities.

In May I had a wonderful morning at The Valley Church at a fundraiser for the Cancer Council as part of the Biggest Morning Tea. It was hosted by the Valley Network. It was a most wonderful opportunity for our West Tamar community to connect. We had lots of laughs, we had lots of cups of tea and it was an incredible feast of treats. Perhaps most importantly, we had the opportunity to listen to some very special guest speakers. It's always so powerful when people are brave enough to share their personal journeys, certainly around cancer survival.

One of those speakers was a beautiful, courageous young mum. Her name is Bec Beeston [CHECKED]. Bec was in her caravan with her family when the news came in over a Zoom call from her genetic counsellor. That call confirmed that Bec had the bracket gene mutation. It's hard to imagine the decision that was put on the table for Bec, for her husband and her family. Preventative action was to have a double mastectomy. That was the decision that Bec made. She would have to say goodbye to her breasts and would count down to the day that she would lose what she affectionately called her body's natural curves. 

Bec bravely shared her story on social media, blow by blow, triumph by triumph, vulnerability and strength all mixed in together. At the Valley Network event, Bec didn't really speak about her own personal journey. She actually spoke more about the women in her life who had been impacted by cancer. Despite her incredible personal journey, she actually shared how she had been inspired by the stories of others around her. It was a wonderful morning where we were all connected by community and by stories. That is exactly what the Valley Network does: it connects us all.

I acknowledge the work of the Valley Network and the Valley Church. They are committed to our West Tamar community and we are grateful to have them.

Members - Hear, hear.


Huon Valley Police and Community Youth Club

[11.42 a.m.]
Mr HARRISS (Huon) - Mr President, I rise this morning to speak about a significant and positive community asset in the Huon Valley - the Huon Valley Police and Community Youth Club, more commonly known as the Huon Valley PCYC. I will note here that I'm patron of the Huon Valley PCYC and am certainly honoured to serve in that role.

PCYC is a nationwide movement that began in Sydney in 1937. It was first introduced to Tasmania in 1946, built on a simple but powerful idea: to support the provision of low-cost, positive sporting, recreational, social and cultural programs in a safe environment, primarily for at-risk and disadvantaged children and youth. Our Huon Valley PCYC supports that and much more, creating safe spaces where people of all ages - young and not so young - come to connect, learn and thrive.

After 10 years of tireless work by passionate, community-minded people led by Jimmy Bell, who has been the driving force from its inception, the Huon Valley PCYC opened its doors on 17 September 2009. At a cost to build of almost $4 million, this 4000-square metre facility became one of the largest projects undertaken in our community. From day one, the vision was clear: to provide a safe, supportive environment for young people, particularly those at risk or disengaged. Today, that vision is alive and well. The PCYC is not just a building - it's a lifeline. It offers sports programs, hosts social and educational programs from leadership workshops to cooking classes, and partners with local services like the Huon Valley Bike Collective, Royal Flying Doctor Service and the Men's Shed.

The impact is real and lasting. I will share a quick story of a young man, very quiet and withdrawn, who began visiting the drop-in centre at the PCYC. The drop-in centre provides a safe space for local youth to gather after school, enjoy a free feed and access to activities and games. It supports our youth by providing mentoring support, mental health referrals and food to take home. This quiet and somewhat withdrawn young man would, at first, call in for a quick bite to eat, mostly choosing to stay out of people's way. Slowly, over time, he connected with other youth and through the trust and consistency of the program, began engaging with the program coordinators. He shared he'd been struggling with thoughts of suicide. This is a young kid and that honest conversation marked a turning point. He later opened up to his family, which allowed him to access the support and care he needed to get through that difficult period. This is just one example of how the PCYC changes lives.

Beyond youth programs, Huon Valley PCYC fosters community connection. It runs initiatives like Operation Happy Birthday for vulnerable families, Parents' Club to combat isolation, and Coffee for a Cause, giving young people practical work experience. It provides inclusive spaces for LGBTIQA+ youth and cultural projects. It has basketball, badminton, pickleball and volleyball courts, indoor cricket nets and two gymnasiums, and a space for Run Move Connect, which is a local business providing exercise programs and options for all ages.

These connections are vital, especially in rural areas like the Huon Valley, where opportunities for social engagement can sometimes be limited. What is remarkable and somewhat concerning is that despite delivering these vital services for 15 years, the Huon Valley PCYC receives no regular funding from local or state government. Every program, every piece of equipment, every initiative has been funded through relentless grant applications, generous donations and volunteer effort. There is no comparable facility in the Huon Valley and yet its future relies on the goodwill of a passionate and dedicated community.

The Huon Valley PCYC is more than a club, it is a second home for hundreds of young people, a hub for families and a cornerstone of community wellbeing. When we invest in places like the PCYC, we invest in the future of our youth and the strength of our communities. The current board worked tirelessly to provide direction and assistance for all the amazing staff and we are very fortunate to have a board that consists of a banking manager, two school principals, a police inspector, senior managers at local council and dedicated community-minded people; all volunteering their time for the benefit of our Huon Valley PCYC and the broader public.


West Coast Wilderness Railway Pathway Program

[11.47 a.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, today I wish to speak about two interconnected success stories from Tasmania's remote West Coast that demonstrate what is possible when we invest in both our heritage and our young people.

Members may recall that I've spoken previously about the pathways program at the West Coast Wilderness Railway. To recap, the program offers year 10 students at Mountain Heights School hands-on exposure to track maintenance, locomotive workshops, on-train service, cafe operations, administration and reservations. This is work - real work - in a real workplace. It was devised with two clear purposes: to create a direct pathway toward local employment, and to improve year 10 attendance by making schooling tangible and immediate. The program was trialled in December 2023 with strong feedback.

Here's what makes this remarkable: five current staff members at the West Coast Wilderness Railway who came through the program are now working for the railway. Five young people who might otherwise have left the region are building careers at home. At least one student is expected to return as an apprentice after completing studies in Burnie, providing a complete pathway from year 10 placement through to skilled apprenticeship and long-term local employment.

For remote western Tasmania, where youth employment opportunities are limited, this homegrown pipeline is vital. It builds skills, gives students tangible prospects, reduces outward migration and strengthens the social fabric. The program brings together skills matching, motivation and retention, and local capacity building, reducing reliance on fly-in staff while improving operational continuity and community pride. This matters especially because the railway has previously struggled to fill technical and operational roles with trained local staff.

We should explore expanding this program to other regions with early exposure and extension beyond year 10. We should consider funding or incentives for employers to take on apprentices from this pathway. When something works this well, we should scale it up.

You cannot run successful education programs without the successful railway, in this case. The West Coast Wilderness Railway's turnaround has been remarkable. I am sure this is of enormous interest that two years ago the railway faced closure or severely interrupted operations. Today, it's experiencing record-breaking success with the highest passenger numbers ever recorded, both annually and during shoulder seasons. In September 2025, the railway achieved official acceptance into Tourism Australia's Cultural Attractions of Australia collective, a prestigious national award placing it alongside Australia's most significant heritage and cultural tourism sites.

From times when no steam engines were operating, the railway now has close to three steam engines in service. I am sure you're pleased to hear that there are currently no major non-conformances reported, no safety, heritage, or regulatory issues, reflecting strong governance, effective maintenance and growing staff capability. Success such as this does bring its challenges. Heritage rail operations are capital intensive, requiring ongoing investment in locomotives, track infrastructure and stations. Maintaining and expanding skilled staff capacity requires secure funding streams.

To fully leverage the Cultural Attractions of Australia status and attract international tourism, we need additional investment, not just in the railway itself, but in the supporting infrastructure, worker accommodation, improved traffic links from Hobart and enhanced marketing. The railway has demonstrated what's achievable - from near shutdown to record patronage, from operational struggles to national recognition, from no steam engines to three, from importing labour to training our own local youth.

To maximise economic, education, and community and tourism returns, it needs long-term, reliable, and consistent funding. One-off grants are helpful, but budgetary certainty and multi-year funding, which are not the only issues for the railway, allow for strategic investment rather than reactive patch-ups. It isn't just about keeping the trains running. It's about jobs in remote regions, youth retention through career pathways, local business benefits from tourism, educational opportunities connecting classrooms to careers, community pride and social cohesion and Tasmania's reputation as a premier heritage tourism destination.

The Pathways Program and the railway's turnaround tell the same story: when we combine heritage assets with strategic thinking, community engagement, and sustained support, remarkable things happen. Five young people are building careers at home. Record visitors are experiencing West Coast heritage. A railway that faced closure is nationally recognised. A community is building capability and confidence. This is what success looks like in regional Tasmania.

The question now is, will the government provide long-term consistent support needed to sustain and expand this success? Will the government commit to a multi-year funding arrangement that allows strategic growth, rather than year by year uncertainty? The railway and the community have shown what they can achieve. They have earned the right to plan confidently for the future. Our young people deserve these pathways. Our communities deserve this investment. Our heritage deserves this recognition and support. 

Members - Hear, hear.


INAUGURAL SPEECH

Member for Montgomery, Mr Hiscutt 

Mr PRESIDENT - Honourable members, before I call the member for Montgomery, I remind all members this is his inaugural speech and we afford him the the honour of being heard in silence, which is what we do for everyone's inaugural speech. Please, no interjections, but if you react with a laugh if there's something funny, or a tear if there's something sad, that's perfectly acceptable.

I welcome to the Chamber members of the honourable member's family, including the former member for Montgomery, Leonie Hiscutt, and other friends as well. 

I also welcome the Central Coast Mayor, Cheryl Fuller, who is here in support of the new member for Montgomery. 

Even though you've been with us for quite a while, there were a few gaps in days, so it might seem like a long time ago that you were elected, but we did have a lack of sitting for a while. We've all been waiting for a long time, and I won't delay it any longer. I call on the honourable member for Montgomery.

[11.55 a.m.]
Mr HISCUTT (Montgomery) - Mr President, honourable members, members of the gallery and family, I rise today to speak with both an immeasurable sense of pride and a great sadness. If this House and the President will allow, I plan to speak both on a condolence motion for the loss of Desmond Hiscutt or, as I called him, Uncle Desi, and to combine this with my inaugural speech. I do this because family is so important to me. I welcome the members of my family and my friends who are in the room today. 

I will speak first on Desi's life and commitment to public service, and then of my own journey to this auspicious and revered place. 

Desmond was the third son of four children and grew up in Howth with his brother, Hugh, my grandfather, Terry, and their younger sister, Mary. He was the son of James, or JT, as he was known, and Susan Hiscutt. He passed away not far from where he had lived most of his life. 

Public service has always been a hallmark of the Hiscutt family, with JT Hiscutt serving as a councillor on the Penguin Council from 1938 to 1971, including time as warden from 1954 to 1958 and 1969 to 1970. Desi's older brother, Hugh Hiscutt, also served as a Penguin councillor between 1966 and 1987 and was warden from 1973 to 1978. 

It was towards the end of his elder brother's tenure on council and movement to this House that Desi made his mark, entering council from the years 1987 to 1993 and as warden from 1990 to 1993. This was the final year of the Penguin Council prior to its amalgamation into the Central Coast Council in 1993. Desi then served for a further three years until 1996 on the Central Coast Council. 

Desi did not stop there. Once again, following in his elder brother's footsteps, he campaigned to become the Legislative Councillor. Hugh had been a member for West Devon from 1983 to 1995. 

The following election is where my story begins. One of my very first memories was climbing the hills behind South Burnie, up near the Menai, not quite old enough for school but old enough to help out. I was dragged along to assist with door-knocking. Those were some very steep hills, which I'm sure the member for Murchison can attest to, as they now fall under her division.

Desi was elected to the Legislative Council as an independent for the division of West Devon on 27 May 1995, succeeding his brother, Hugh, and sworn in on 20 June 1995. Desi gave his inaugural speech on 4 July and spoke about his strong independence, hopes and wishes for the area.

The division of West Devon was abolished in 1997 and Desi was allocated to the new division of Emu Bay. He was the only person ever to represent Emu Bay. The division of Emu Bay was later abolished in 1999. Desi was unfortunately unallocated in the reduction and redistribution of divisions at the time and received some compensation for the reduction in his term of office following his departure on 30 June 1999. Desi unsuccessfully contested the division of Murchison on 28 August 1999, marking his final electoral campaign.

Uncle Desi was so much more than just a public figure: he was a family man, a farmer, a fix-it man, but more than anything, he enjoyed making people laugh. I remember a day having dinner at the Penguin Sports and Services Club only a few years ago. I believe we were celebrating an 80th or 85th birthday with all the local Hiscutts in attendance. A member of the group briefly left to use the restroom while having only just started eating his lunch. While he was away from the table, Desi, as an 80-year-old, took his plate and hid it behind a pillow. Upon returning, the person asked where their plate had gone. Des proceeded to let them know that the waiter thought they were finished and had taken it away already. He said it with such conviction that it was believed until the rest of the group were unable to contain their laughter. This and other practical jokes amused Desmond to no end.

In March 2023, Desi's two brothers passed away within three days of each other. It was a very sad time for the whole family. I remember meeting with Desi a day or two later, and though obviously in grief, he still quipped, 'Swaddle me and cotton wool me, boy. I love me brothers dearly, but I don't want to follow them to where they've gone this time.'. As Desi aged, the farm property became too much to handle and he and his wife Margaret moved to a new unit right beside the doctors and the pharmacies at Penguin.

Unfortunately, he did not have very long to enjoy his time at the new residence. A fall occurred and his mobility deteriorated. He moved into the local aged care residence where his needs could be more easily met. On 19 June 2025, Desi passed away peacefully in his sleep at Coroneagh Park. I visited him often, and he always had a keen mind and a keen interest into my foray into politics. As his health declined, he would regularly say, 'I've just got to stay long alive to see you elected, me boy.' I'm very proud to have done so for Desi, and for all the great leaders that our family has produced. I would often say that I stand on the shoulders of giants, and he was one of them.

I ask that we pause for a minute of silence to reflect upon Desi's life and to give me a moment to compose. 

Mr President, where do I begin? My mum and dad were farmers on the north-west coast of Tassie. Most of you in this room know them well, but for the benefit of the record, they are down-to-earth people, well-known in the community; although I always reflected on how funny it was that for the first half of my life I was known as Ben's boy in the community, but for the second half I was more often thought of as Leonie's boy.

Dad took over the farm from his father and two uncles, continuing to run it to this day. I remember learning the value of hard work and teamwork on the farm. It used to be my job to pick up the chat potatoes: those not good enough for sale but good enough to eat at home or give to friends. I also learned the fundamentals of maths, science and commerce, counting the broccoli heads, watching what grows in different seasons, and once working out the value a farmer got versus the end of sale of the chips. 

Maths was a passion of mine and I would work out the value of each potato as it went in the box. In case you were wondering, in the early 2000s a large fries from Maccas was around $2, and the value of the same potato to the farmer was seven cents. Whilst writing this speech, an article came out from the ABC dated 9 September titled, 'Imported potatoes threaten Tasmanian growers as companies look for cost savings overseas'. From the article I quote:

For $5, a hungry punter can get their hands on a bucket of large fries from a fast-food outlet in the north-west Tasmania. It's a record high price for the popular multinational. Mere kilometres down the road, the farmer who grows those potatoes will get 11 cents.

It seems that not much has changed. 

We lived a simple life growing up. I never felt like we didn't have enough, but we also didn't have everything. Dad would say we were rich, we had land and Mum would say we couldn't pay for groceries with dirt. I do remember her - probably shouldn't say this - with pocketknife in hand, removing the stubs from the broccolis at the supermarket so that we could save money. Frugal might be the word.

I had two brothers growing up. We fought and played and cheered and supported each other like all siblings do. When I was 14, my brother returned from a school footy trip and fell ill and went downhill very fast. I went to school the next day and he stayed home sick. He had passed away by lunchtime from meningococcal. This hit our family very hard, as can be imagined. If there is ever one of us boys who would have taken over the family farm, it would have been him.

My eldest brother finished law and IT at UTAS and now successfully runs an IT business with offices across the globe. It has received many accolades, including multiple Microsoft Partner of the Year awards and being named in the AFR Best Places to Work awards. I say I might still be the favourite son as I stayed home and had the grandkids, though he does have his own kids now.

I finished school at Marist Regional College and went to complete a Bachelor of Environmental Design at UTAS in Launceston. I had planned to be an architect, which was a further two years master's degree to complete afterwards. My parents told me to look at how many people graduated and how many jobs there were. My advice: listen to your parents. After completing the first degree, I knew that I wanted to settle in the north-west of Tassie. There are very few jobs in the architectural field, so I cut my losses and started working in manufacturing, using the drafting skills that I had learnt. 

I spent the remainder of my working life up until this point in manufacturing; some in a construction setting, some in a factory production setting and some in a bit-of-everything-setting. Although I was never hands-on, I could manage customers, suppliers and staff and moved into project management and quotations. Whilst working, I took every opportunity that presented itself for professional development and continued learning.

The importance of family cannot be understated in my life. I met my now wife when I was 16 and she was 17. We both worked in the old Burnie Harris Scarfe building which is no longer there. I was working in the dock and she was working in the menswear. I was totally oblivious to this laughing girl who kept looking in on me while I was working. Thick-as-a-brick, mum calls me.

Together, we moved to Launceston for university, then we had a long-distance relationship for two years while she attended Charles Sturt University to finish off her medical imaging degree. Finally, we settled down on the northwest coast where she found a job and still proudly works as a radiographer at the Mersey Community Hospital.

Last year I celebrated a 'half my life' day with her where I calculated the exact day that I had spent half my life with her, and half my life without. We have been together for 18 years and married for over 11. We have three young children who make me proud every day: Marli, who is 10, Joel, who is 8, and Flynn, who is 4.[checked]

I won't say things have always been perfect and we've had our share of challenges, but there is no-one else I would rather share this crazy journey with. The love and support she has shown me for running for this position has been nothing short of extraordinary. I will forever be in her debt.

Mr President, my journey to this sacred place began many years ago. In fact, you could say it began back in 1938 when JT Hiscutt sat on the Penguin Council, or even before that when the Mckenna's did. I saw from a young age what Dessie and Hughey did and the respect they earned for them from their community. The same characteristics are present in mum and dad too.

I don't think there are many in the community that would say a bad word about the Hiscutts. I found this particularly true when doorknocking in 2008 for my first foray into local council, where a member of the public said, 'if you're half as good as your mother, you'll do OK'. In years 10, 11 and 12, I attended Youth Parliament after my eldest brother had previously been a participant.

In the first two years, I was the only member of my school to attend, so I had to make new friends. They provided a welcoming environment that encouraged this. In my third and final year, the House of Assembly - which is where Youth Parliament is normally held - was undergoing renovations, so the entire session was held in this House. I attended with the member for Murchison's son Edward, among others from my school. As this was the only Youth Parliament held in the Legislative Council, a historical picture was taken. If anyone wants to see my 17-year-old sideburns and spot of bleached hair on my head - which was the trend at the time - the picture hangs proudly just outside the President's Lounge and has been on these walls for close to 20 years. It does, at times, feel full circle to be back here again.

I was fortunate enough to be in Hobart for Youth Parliament this year, and it filled my heart to sit in front of those kids who, just like me, may one day grow up to be our future leaders.

I first ran for council in 2018 and was successful - just. It was at this election that I was able to understand the power of one vote. I was 1.84 votes away from being excluded. This meant that, with 9 councillors to be elected, if one voter had put me ninth and the other person eighth, it would have changed the trajectory of my life for years to come. I am grateful to all those people who voted for me.

I have enjoyed my time on council and have always been a very active member in the community. I would like to take a moment to thank the Mayor of Central Coast Council - Cheryl Fuller[checked], who is here with us today - for her support and assistance, and all the councillors who have who have supported me on my journey to this place.

I have always felt that you need to meet and talk with the people where they are, not expect them to come to you. What I felt most proud of was the community generation you got to see. Every event had a raffle of donated prizes. It made me realise what a lucky community we grow up in.

I was re-elected to council in 2022, this time with a much improved position. In this election I put myself forward for the role of Deputy Mayor. I was narrowly defeated by only 42 votes. The position was taken by Councillor John Beswick[checked], who had become a close friend of mine on council during the preceding term. He first learned about his victory when I called him to congratulate him. Understandably, I was upset at the time, but my dad said to me, 'Be proud of yourself. You've gone up against a quality candidate, well-known in the region, and you almost got there at 32'. I needed that.

The loss, however, gave me the drive and determination to do whatever it took at the next election, the one that got me into this House. The rest, as they say, is history.

I had various achievements on council, some big and some small. From removing the fee for traffic management, allowing shop owners to clean their awnings more easily, to providing disability parking near the dog park, to the soon-reopening of the famous rocket ship at ANZAC Park. However, my proudest achievement was a notice of motion which radically changed how the council approached town planning and development applications. The simple wording of the motion belies the change in momentum that has swung within council: from trying to find a problem, to trying to find a solution. 

This gave the impetus for the Director of Strategic Growth, Daryl Connelly, who I must thank for his support and friendship, to apply and receive a $1.6 million grant from the federal government to strategically work out where, why or how the housing of our future would look under the Our Homes Our Future initiative. This motion has also brought about a development application pre-approval mediation policy, which allows developers and representors to discuss their issues early before they become a point of contention. As I understand it, this is the first council in Tasmania to do this, and it should be a role model for other councils.

The election of 2025 was an extended affair, firstly with me announcing my intention to run almost a year early, and secondly having been extended further with the federal election. In fact, it wasn't until mid-June that I realised I had not had time to cut enough firewood for the winter. I would take a moment to congratulate all the people who ran for the election: Stephen Parry, Darren Briggs, Adrian Pickin and Gatty Burnett. It takes a lot of courage to put your hand up and, even if unsuccessful, it says a lot about people for having a go.

Outside of politics I have represented my community in various other ways: some simple, like coaching my daughter's basketball and helping at my son's Auskick, but also some much more complex roles. I'm on the board of Devonport Childcare Incorporated, a not-for-profit childcare organisation which offers two full-service daycare clinics as well as servicing six outside-school-hour services for many of the local schools. I assisted in navigating a tumultuous time when our primary centre, Malangenna, had a massive flood event and we needed to pivot to provide care to all of the displaced children at other venues. 

This was all whilst in the process of organising a new CEO, meaning heavy involvement from the board on decision-making. Through you, Mr President, I would like to take a moment to thank the honourable member for Rosevears, in her capacity as Minister for Education, for her assistance in this matter. I was also successful in approaching the Labor member, federal member for Braddon, Anne Urquhart, for a federal government grant of $4 million which will be used to address the childcare crisis in the north-west by developing a brand-new facility on the current Malangenna site. The situation in childcare is dire indeed, and although my youngest child moves to kindergarten next year, I feel for new parents trying to return to the workforce.

I am also currently the chair of the Penguin 150 Committee, a group of locals who are celebrating the sesquicentenary of the proclamation of Penguin: its 150th anniversary. We decided to hold a year-long series of events, including a Penguin Waddle, which had me dressed up as a penguin leading up to 500 kids along the Penguin foreshore, to an Easter Eggstravaganza, a Frost and Fire Gala, a cemetery walk, a celebration of the Dutch history and finally, a street party, which only happened last week.

As a committee, almost all of these events were free and family friendly. The committee raised over $100,000 to show off Penguin to the state and the country, and we had many expats living abroad that returned for the main event last week. I take a moment to thank the chairman of the Penguin History Group, Craig Dunham, for asking me to chair this committee about two years ago when we first met. 

I would also like to recognise the contributions to the committee from Gary and Penny Hall[both checked], who are here today, especially their contributions in bringing a worldwide focus to the celebration, with their efforts resulting in the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Thailand to Australia contributing and attending the Frost and Fire event alongside the Honorary Consul of Thailand, Wimalin Beattie[checked]. We also had contributions from the Honorary Consul of the Netherlands at our celebration of the Dutch event, broadly thanks to the efforts of Jeanne Koetsier[checked], who I also thank. At our street party last week, we had visits from the Consular Corps including the Honorary Consuls of Thailand, Latvia, Israel, the U.K., Switzerland, Timor Leste and the Netherlands, and the Governor presided over the event as well.

It has been a privilege to chair this committee and I hope that we have done our town proud. A special thanks must be made to Leigh Gracie, the Central Coast Council's Community Development Officer, whose tremendous efforts helped facilitate these events; they would not have been the events they were without her, and the Central Coast Council also in general for their support. As part of the celebrations, the committee gave out nearly 1000 pins to all of the school children in the area. This was paying homage to the medallions that were given out to all the school children for the 100-year celebrations. I proudly wear my uncle Hughie's 100-year celebration pin alongside my new pin on my chest today.

I look forward to representing the people of Montgomery. From the bustling townships and cities of Burnie, Ulverstone, Penguin and Sheffield, to the villages and small towns of Riana, Turners Beach and Ridgley, to the rugged heartlands like Paradise, Cradle Mountain, Loongana and Tewkesbury, all of it is beautiful, from the sea to the mountain, and its people come from all walks of life as well.

I campaigned strongly on the independence of the Upper House. We are here to review the legislation put forth by the government of the day. Our role is not necessarily to block legislation that has a mandate to proceed and is for the good of the community; our role is to ensure the legislation is accurate, and if it can be amended to be even better, to change it. That is why we go through it line by line. There are 14 other heads in this chamber, each of whom have a wealth of knowledge and thankfully the collective wisdom will, I'm sure, prevail.

One lens that I would like to particularly apply over future legislation will be the concerning movement of young people out of Tasmania, and if there is an opportunity I see to amend legislation to benefit retaining young people in Tasmania, I will pursue that lead. This does not mean that people shouldn't be allowed to go out and see the world, but they shouldn't need to leave Tasmania to get a job in their preferred positions. 

Mr President, members, guests, friends and especially family, I feel privileged to sit in these halls but also feel the weight of responsibility heavily around my shoulders. I will serve to the absolute best of my abilities the people of Montgomery and the people of Tasmania. I would like to thank a few people if the chamber will allow: I thank those that came before me, both family and others. I thank the other members of this House for making me feel most welcome. I thank Meg Windram[checked], who was mum's executive officer for 10 years, and has continued her services to me. I think she is watching. I thank my dad, not only for helping raise me but for his assistance in my campaign and always being by my side or a phone call away.

Sometimes people say that you shouldn't meet your heroes, but for me, I met my hero 35 years ago on the day that I was born. Mum, Leonie Hiscutt, or 'fearless leader', as those in the chamber may have known her; I have always looked up to her, and now following in her footsteps is the greatest honour I have achieved. I said during the campaign that she had very little shoes, but they would be big to fill; but I also intend to walk my own path. I thank her from the bottom of my heart for all the love and support she has shown me throughout my life. I couldn't have asked for a better mum.

Importantly, I want to thank my immediate family, my wife and kids. They are amazing people and the reason I am doing what I do. I couldn't be here without their understanding and support. To my kids, I know that you will grow to be future leaders in your community and I hope that I can be a role model for you. To my wife, I love you and I thank you. Just being a member of parliament was not a goal for me, but being the member for Montgomery has been, and I am so happy to have been given this opportunity. I hope to serve with conviction and be remembered alongside those who have come before me as a gentleman, a statesman and most importantly, as a good and kind person. I thank you all for listening and look forward to the following terms and all the challenges that it may face. Thank you.

I commend the condolence motion to the House.

Mr PRESIDENT - Before I put the motion, I would like to congratulate the member on his first contribution, and I know that we all look forward to future contributions in the near future, and I must also compliment you on that great tie that you have worn with the penguins.




CONDOLENCE MOTION

Mr Desmond Hiscutt - Member of the Legislative Council

[12.19 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I want to really acknowledge that contribution. I got the tissue out before you did. I certainly look forward to your contributions in the House and acknowledge that that was a fantastic inaugural speech. It's so lovely to have your family here. I can see that there is probably no dry eye in the family gallery, so thank you.

I stand here today to pay my respects and to celebrate Mr Desmond Hiscutt, and to acknowledge a former member of this Chamber, and to celebrate a farmer, and to celebrate a life well lived. It seemed very fitting that the Honourable member for Montgomery made this condolence motion his inaugural speech as well.

Des, as he was known to so many, was a man immersed in community, family, and service, and I've certainly had the pleasure of meeting 'Uncle Dessie'. His story is not only the story of one individual, but also the story of a family deeply embedded in the fabric of Tasmania's north-west coast. 

Born into the Hiscutt family at Howth, Des grew up on the family property that had been in their hands since the 1860s. Farming was not just a livelihood for him, it was an identity, a way of life. The Hiscutt property has sustained generations, and Des himself carried that stewardship with pride, but farming, for him, was never an end in itself - it was also the foundation from which he entered public life. 

When he ran for the Legislative Council, he made a commitment to retire from farming, with the clear promise of being a full-time representative of the people. This decision tells us a lot about the man, Mr President - that he believed public duty deserved his full attention, and when entrusted with the responsibility of representation, nothing less than total commitment was acceptable.

Before entering this Chamber, Des had already shown his dedication to community through local government, and we've already heard that from the honourable member for Montgomery in his contribution. He served six years on the Penguin Council, including three as warden. He was recognised as someone who listened carefully, made decisions fairly, and put his community first - admirable, Mr President. 

Following the amalgamation of councils in 1993, he was elected to a three-year term on the new Central Coast Council. It was a time of change and adjustment for local communities. Des was there to provide both community and reassurance, bringing the values of fairness, practicality, and hard work to the task of shaping a new council for a new era. I also would like to acknowledge the mayor of the Central Coast Council, Cheryl Fuller. It's lovely to have her with us today.

In 1995, Des was elected to the Legislative Council, representing the division of West Devon. Two years later, with the redistribution of boundaries, he was elected as the member for Emu Bay. He served in this Chamber from 27 May 1995 until 30 June 1999. His time here was marked by diligence and dedication. He took the responsibility of membership seriously, and he worked to bring the voice of his community into this Chamber.

Of course, his service was not without challenge. When seats were restructured and the division of Emu Bay was abolished, he lost his place in this Chamber in 1999. It was a very difficult process, that redistribution. I feel for him, Mr President. Yet, even in leaving, he left behind a record of commitment to his electors and the wider Tasmanian community. 

One cannot speak of Des without acknowledging the broader Hiscutt family, whose contribution to Tasmanian public life is both unique and significant. Des succeeded his brother Hugh as a member of the Legislative Council, followed more recently by the former member for Montgomery, Leonie Hiscutt, from 2013 to 2025, and the former Leader of this House.

Now, we have just welcomed, or more recently welcomed, the next generation of the Hiscutt family, Casey Hiscutt, to serve his community and our state as the member for Montgomery. It goes on, Mr President, and who knows where it might end.

As I said, and notably my predecessor as leader - the niece of Des Hiscutt by marriage, which is obviously the recently retired Leonie Hiscutt - is the longest-serving female leader in this Chamber: from March 2017 to May 2025. I just want to again thank Leonie for her service and dedication. 

The Hiscutt name is one that has become synonymous with the service in this Chamber and Des carried that responsibility with pride and humility, as will, I'm sure, the newly elected member for Montgomery, the honourable Casey Hiscutt. His place in that lineage reminds us that public service often runs through families, but it is only made possible through the individual's willingness to give of themselves. Des was such a man, willing to serve, willing to sacrifice, and willing to place community above self. 

In this Chamber, Des was respected for his good sense of humour and straightforwardness, and we've heard about some of the humour today. He brought the plain-spoken wisdom of a farmer and the grounded judgment of a local councillor. He listened, he considered, and he contributed in a manner that strengthened other deliberations of the time.

Mr President, in his inaugural speech on 4 July 1995 Des said, 'When the business of the table is over, win or lose, the differences are forgotten and friendships are renewed.' Wise words. Beyond the public record, Des will be remembered as a man of decency and kindness. He valued honesty. He was deeply committed to his family. He knew the worth of hard work and understood the dignity of service. Those who knew him speak of a man whose word could be trusted and whose handshake meant something.

It is also important to reflect on the sense of place that shaped Des - the north-west coast and its strong family traditions. Its resilient communities gave him his grounding. He carried those values into this Chamber - the values of hard work, self-reliance and being a good neighbour. These values are lived every day in our rural and regional communities, and Des was their voice in this Chamber during his time as a member.

Mr President, condolence motions give us pause to reflect not just on the life of one individual, but also on what their life tells us about ourselves and our community. In remembering Desmond Hiscott, we remember the value of rural communities to Tasmania's identity. We remember the dignity of service in this Chamber, and we remember that our democracy depends on people of integrity stepping forward, often at personal cost, to serve the common good. As we extend our condolences today, we also extend our gratitude for a man who gave his working life to farming, to local government, to his community, and the parliament, gratitude for the example he set and gratitude for the family who supported him in that journey.

I extend my deepest sympathies to his family, his friends and his community, and we honour his loss, but also join them in celebrating a life of service and contribution. May his memory inspire us all to serve with integrity, to work with dedication and to place our communities at the heart of our decisions. 

Mr President, I commend this condolence motion.

Motion agreed to.

That the Committee report by 2 December 2025

I will speak briefly on this motion in my name, which is to establish a select committee for the purpose of securing an appropriate mechanism by which to interact with the Tasmanian Planning Commission independent expert panel regarding its Macquarie Point Multipurpose Stadium integrated assessment and final reports.

This is a straightforward proposition, although it does require some stepping outside our usual select committee approach. The context for this motion is the proposed Macquarie Point stadium, the Project of State Significance assessment process occurring in relation to that and culminating in an upcoming vote in this place on the order, which is expected to occur in the first week of December.

The members of this place take that vote very seriously, and many of us are taking great care in seeking information, advice and evidence on the proposed project to assist in making the decision on our votes. Naturally, a key document and key information include the TPC panel's Integrated Assessment Report, published in September, as a culmination of the Project of State Significance process. In preparation for the December vote on the order, members of this place are constantly receiving solicited and unsolicited information and briefings. We are receiving numerous briefings from the government and from the project's proponents, the Macquarie Point Development Corporation. Briefings from the government and a range of stakeholders are expected to continue throughout this month.

In respect of the government briefings, we have already received on the stadium project, a common theme I have found less-than-appropriate is the regularity with which we are told what the TPC panel's Integrated Assessment Report apparently says or doesn't say and how we should interpret it. Comments and assertions are regularly made by the government, in public, in the media and now in our briefings, beginning from the day on which that integrated assessment report was released, which characterised the content and the findings of the IAR. These comments and assertions have not been able to be tested or clarified or responded to by the panel members.

It occurred to me that MLCs would likely benefit from the opportunity to engage with the panel members to put questions about the IAR and its content and findings, and to clarify some of the comments and assertions being made about the work done and the recommendations made. Personally, I certainly felt I would benefit from that opportunity, and I contacted the TPC to ask whether such an opportunity could be made available, and, if so, under what circumstances the panel members would be in a position to provide that opportunity.

I received a clear indication from the TPC panel members that they would not consider it appropriate to provide separate briefings to individual MPs or parties, but that they would be prepared to respond to any formal request from a House of parliament, which would include a committee of parliament, to answer questions in relation to its deliberations and the contents of both the Integrated Assessment Report and the report under Section 26(1) of the State Policies and Projects Act, which is the recommendation report.

I have an email I received from Mr John Ramsay, Executive Commissioner of the TPC, outlining the stipulations of panel members in relation to the possibility of responding to a request from parliament to appear and answer questions.

Mr President, I seek leave to table the email, if I may.

Leave granted; document tabled.

Ms WEBB - The email also makes clear that panel members, should they appear at the request of parliament, would not respond to questions that relate to issues concerning ongoing public or parliamentary discussion in relation to the Macquarie Point Multipurpose Stadium proposal, subsequent to the submission of their reports, unless such questions were directly relevant to the matters of the subject of the reports. I know members will understand this is entirely reasonable.

Having established the conditions under which the panel members would make themselves available to engage with MLCs and answer questions, I gave consideration to an appropriate parliamentary mechanism to facilitate that appearance. An important consideration, in my view, was that all MLCs who wish to engage in that process should have the opportunity to do so. This precluded the use of an existing committee such as one of our Government Administration Committees or the Public Accounts Committee, because the membership of those committees is is limited.

The option which presented as most appropriate for the task was to establish a select committee with a very narrow term of reference which would provide for a public hearing with the TPC panel members. The unusual element of the select committee is that it varies from our usual standing orders, which specify select committee memberships of three to five members. This select committee was able to be comprised of as many members as wished to participate. Consequently, the motion includes the names of 11 members. Such an approach is not unprecedented, and some members here will recall at least one other time such a committee has been formed in relatively recent times with nearly all members on the committee. Another variation from the usual standing orders, just for the sake of completeness here on the record, are the standing orders related to the quorum requirements, particularly in relation to taking of evidence which under our standing orders is specified as three members of a select committee, but here we have set it to be six, which will be a majority of the committee.

If the Chamber supports the establishment of this select committee today, I anticipate, but don't pre-empt, that it could then have a first meeting quite promptly and determine a time later in the month for a public hearing to which the panel members can be formally requested to appear by way of a summons, which is what has been stipulated as the approach preferred by the panel in the email correspondence from Mr John Ramsay, which I've tabled.

The motion provides that 2 December be the date for reporting of the committee to the Chamber. This is prior to the anticipated debate of the order in this Chamber and the intention would be that the report would simply be the Hansard of the public hearing with the panel members, similarly to the way, for example, GBE Estimates hearings are reported on, that members will be familiar with.

I appreciate the conversations I've had with members in progressing plans for the establishment of this committee via this motion. I note that members have largely indicated an interest to participate in the committee if it is supported by the Chamber today. With that explanation of the motion, I commend the motion to the Chamber.

Ms O'Connor - Do you close -

Mr PRESIDENT - No.

[12.37 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President,  I acknowledge the member for Nelson who has brought this motion forward for consideration. It's a motion to create a select committee with power to be informed by the members of the Tasmanian Planning Commission, the independent expert assessment panel that assessed the Macquarie Point multipurpose stadium proposal and that the committee report by 2 December 2025.

As we all know, the Tasmanian Planning Commission has released its recommendation report and integrated assessment report. Encouragingly, the commission found that transport access, safety and noise can be successfully managed, and the government supports this project and responded to the commission's recommendation report.

The final order of the Macquarie Point precinct has been made by Her Excellency in line with it being declared a Project of State Significance. The order was developed collaboratively across multiple agencies, regulators and organisations and the final order is primarily based on the draft permit conditions provided to the commission panel in July 2025 and reflects the significant contributions from all parties.

Obviously, however, it will have no effect until it's been considered and approved by both Houses of parliament. As we know, the order is expected to be debated by the Legislative Council in December. I thank the member for providing some possible time frames around the committee, noting that it's to report back on 2 December and what its intention is in relation to the committee's report. Yes, I have been part of a committee that virtually provided the Hansard from the committee as part of the report and that was the report as it states. That is what appears to be what the member's intention is and have an early meeting to establish a date that would work.

The government certainly won't be standing in the way of this committee being established. I think it's reasonable.

[12.39 p.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - Mr President, while I'm on my feet, I want to congratulate our new - who we've known for some months now - colleague, the member for Montgomery. Well done for making us all teary in here this morning during your contribution.

It sounds like the Council views the member for Nelson's motion favourably, and that is a very good thing, because it is essential that we do have the opportunity to quiz the members of the Tasmanian Planning Commission Expert Independent Panel about the findings in its final "Integrated Assessment Report", which was handed down on 15 September 2025. 

I take the opportunity to [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.6_D=7.9_C=0.81]  remind honourable members that within almost less than an hour of the Tasmanian Planning Commission's final report [Bookmark: Phr3_O=37.8_D=25.0_C=0.85]  being delivered, we had the Premier and other members of government effectively dismissing it, and saying that they were going to carry on regardless of the multitude of issues that were raised by the TPC, and its final recommendation under the State Policies and Projects Act that parliament/government not proceed with [Bookmark: Phr4_O=63.6_D=0.0_C=0.19]  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=65.2_D=11.6_C=0.81]  a multibillion-dollar stadium at Macquarie Point. 

I am not going to make a particularly long contribution today, but just in summary, should this motion pass, what the TPC [Bookmark: Phr6_O=79.0_D=15.9_C=0.82]  will be able to answer questions on is its core findings: that the stadium will have a benefit-cost ratio of less than half [Bookmark: Phr7_O=95.6_D=29.6_C=0.84] , that there will be a substantial net cost to the Tasmanian community. The reason for this is that the economic and social benefits are small compared to the massive public cost of the stadium. We know that cost rises by the day. In total, the measurable social benefits, according to the TPC, are small. When the social costs are taken into account, it's highly unlikely that any unquantifiable social and cultural impacts, both positive and negativ [Bookmark: Phr8_O=125.3_D=30.0_C=0.87] e, will significantly change the excess of costs over benefits, and therefore the justification for the project. 

The cost to construct the stadium, including associated works, a number of which remain largely uncosted, equates to almost $6000 for every Tasmanian household not dependent on Commonwealth income support as its primary source of income. To pay for the stadium through taxes over its assumed life of 30 years would require state taxes to be [Bookmark: Phr9_O=155.5_D=29.9_C=0.86]  raised by about $50 million per annum, according to the TPC, with obvious implications for the cost of living for all, not just those benefiting from the stadium. The loan required for the stadium is estimated to be approximately $1 billion. That was on a previous cost estimate of the construction of the stadium, which we now know as of a month or so ago is at $1.13 billion [Bookmark: Phr10_O=185.6_D=28.0_C=0.83]  and, of course, that will be rising as well. 

At the end of 10 years, because of the compounding interest on deficit financing, the debt attributable to the stadium would be approximately $1.8 billion; again, that was on the previous cost estimate. The stadium, including its roof, through its size, scale and form, will be dominant within the landscape, diminishing the prominence and significance of the domain headland as a frame of Sullivans Cove [Bookmark: Phr11_O=214.5_D=1.5_C=0.84] , impacts on the cenotaph [Bookmark: Phr12_O=216.4_D=29.8_C=0.84] , of course, and standing as a significant obtrusive element in the present urban form in and around beautiful Sullivans Cove.

The TPC found, in the opinion of the panel, the stadium would irrevocably change for the worse the way in which the landscape and urban pattern is appreciated and understood, not just by the people of Hobart, not just by the people of Lutruwita, Tasmania, but people who come here from all over the world to enjoy and [Bookmark: Phr13_O=246.4_D=4.5_C=0.69]  appreciate our heritage and the marvels of our little working port.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=252.2_D=14.1_C=0.85] The TPC found very significant adverse impacts on a number of places, the most significant being the sacred ground of the Cenotaph and the Royal Engineers Building. I note here that the government [Bookmark: Phr15_O=266.8_D=16.3_C=0.82]  has managed to quiet some of the concerns of the RSL about the impact of the stadium on the Cenotaph by providing the RSL with a long-term lease on the Royal Engineers building. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=283.5_D=21.5_C=0.83]  There are also going to be significant heritage impacts along Hunter Street, and the panel concluded that the adverse effects are unacceptable. 

The project will not be a fair development, according to the panel, in that it will extensively and irreparably damage the historic cultural heritage of the heritage listed buildings in Hunter Street and the Engineers building, most particularly the Cenotaph. It will also adversely affect the general character of Sullivans Cove as a whole and the experience of it. The panel does not consider that the stadium building will be iconic as claimed by the proponent. 

Let us take a moment to note that we have never seen, not yet, the final designs for the proposed Macquarie Point Stadium, but we are told that they are about 70 per cent complete. That's reassuring. 

Ms Forrest - We were told in the briefing that the roof was completely designed and they were going to provide the design but we haven't seen it yet.

Ms O'CONNOR - No, we haven't seen it yet, that's right. It's all to be taken on trust - this massive project with all the massive risks that are associated with it and identified by independent experts.

In conclusion, the panel found the fundamental problem is the size, location and geographical features of the site in its highly valued context that do not support the disproportionately large monolithic building proposed. It is a building which is incongruent with the valued characteristics of its spatial context, completely at odds with the long-established planning principles guiding and informing development in Tasmania and in Sullivans Cove, and with the land and urban fabric surrounding the site and the heritage values associated with nearby places. 

The panel found that proceeding with the project will give rise to irrevocable and unacceptable impacts on Hobart's spatial and landscape character, urban form and historic cultural heritage. The project represents a net significant cost and will diminish the economic welfare of Tasmanians as a whole and that, of course, would be over generations. Our children and our grandchildren will be paying for this stadium. It offers almost no scope for the site to become a vibrant, active place that is attractive to visit outside of major event mode. In very simple terms, the panel found the stadium is too big for the site and the benefits it will bring are significantly outweighed by the disbenefits it has created, 

In many ways the future of our budget and this island's future prosperity sits with the members of this Council, as we know, because the stadium audit tabled today, as it was in both places, is supported by government and cravenly it is supported by Labor members, and so it will get through the House of Assembly. A number of members of the crossbench and of course the Greens will be voting against it, but it will be up to this place, to cast a cold, clear eye over that order.

I note there is another motion coming forward, an excellent motion by the honourable member for Murchison that has been flagged, that would would give us a much greater opportunity to scrutinise the details of that order, which we would not otherwise have had. 

Given the consequence of the order, should it be approved and therefore the consequence of each of our votes in this place, it is essential that we hear from the members of the Tasmanian Planning Commission expert panel on the proposed Macquarie Point Stadium.

I like the proactive and creative initiative of the honourable member for Nelson and thank her very much for providing council with this rare opportunity to go into that final assessment report and ask questions of the people who wrote it, showing them more respect, I am sure, in that process then they've been shown by either the government or the Labor opposition.

The Greens strongly support this motion and the opportunity that it provides for members of this special place to get to the bottom of the final assessment report, ask some questions in the interests of our constituents and the people of Tasmania, and cast the right vote on the day when it comes.

[12.49 p.m.]
Mr EDMUNDS (Pembroke) - Mr President, to get the ball rolling, I welcome the motion. Me and my Labor colleague, Sarah Lovell, will be supporting it.

When this report dropped, which was 18 September 2025, I believe, my party contacted the AFL, the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC), Macquarie Point Development Corporation, Stadiums Tasmania and, indeed, the government, seeking a briefing.

We have had the briefing with the AFL, we have had the briefing with Macquarie Point Development Corporation, we've had the briefing with Stadiums Tasmania and, indeed, the government participated in those briefings or sat in on them.

The TPC - and I do welcome that we are doing this motion. I think it's a good outcome. I know we've had the response to the member for Nelson tabled, which I appreciate, but I am a little bit puzzled, because the reply that the Labor Party received when it asked for a briefing was a little bit more curt - and I will read that into the Hansard, just for compare-and-contrast purposes. I didn't walk in here today expecting to be giving anyone a clip, and perhaps I'm not giving anyone a clip, but I will read this into the Hansard, and perhaps others can look at what the member for Nelson has tabled.[tbc]

Thanks for your email. The Commission is of the view that the detailed assessment report of the Macquarie Point multipurpose stadium covers all the relevant issues and, in effect, speaks for itself.

It would not be consistent with the Commission's independent status to conduct individual briefings with members of parliament on the content of the report.

Similarly, it is obviously not appropriate for the Commission to be involved in political debate on the report or for there to be a perception of involvement in political debate. 

Implying no disrespect to the Leader of the Opposition, in the circumstances, the Commission must decline the invitation for a briefing.

Best regards,
John Ramsay
[TBC]

That reply was received, I believe, within two hours of the request for a briefing. Now, that's fine. I just note the lack of constructive tone in that, as opposed to the letter that was received 40 days later about the other request for a briefing. Perhaps I'm missing something, and they might have sent a follow-up email to the leader of the Labor Party again suggesting this pathway, but I am not aware of one that exists. While I appreciate the offer, I find it interesting that a different tone was struck.

I noted the clip in the previous member's address about the approach of different parties to this, and I do think they're different.

Again, I didn't plan on being very grumpy during this speech, and I will really welcome these hearings because I think it's really important to get this stuff on the record, and this is a good way to do it. It will be in Hansard, everyone can ask their questions and be informed, which is what, certainly, throughout this process benefits everybody.

While we're on the topic, I had become aware that there were briefings on this legislation that were not including myself, the member for Pembroke, and the member for Rumney. I did raise that with representatives of the government, and was told it would cease, but I understand that it's continued. I am a little bit puzzled as to why that is the case, certainly because there's never been an offer that's been refused; it's been a shut-out.

I ask myself the question, is there another piece of legislation where we've held our briefings during the week where members of the Chamber, which we are first and foremost, have been excluded from those briefings? I don't think there's one, so I'm not sure what's so special about this bill, and as a member of a party, I don't think that precludes me. I am unsure if the Greens member has been invited or she has also been excluded, as a member of a political party.

Ms O'Connor - We have had briefings on the order.

Mr EDMUNDS - Okay, so that's very interesting, Mr President. A member of a political party, the Greens, has been -

Ms O'Connor - Invited to the general briefing.

Mr EDMUNDS - A member of the Greens has been invited, but members of the Labor Party have not, to my knowledge. I might stand to be corrected, but that is not the case. Indeed, when we had the discussions, it was acknowledged that that wasn't happening and it would change. I think that's very regrettable and speaks to the consistent misunderstanding of how the Legislative Council operates by members of the other place. I know we have the other briefings coming up in the week that we're doing GBE estimates, but I think it's pretty poor form, to say the least. It's weird, and I actually think it's a tactical mistake by the government to not include members who want to be informed. Now, that being said, of course -

Ms O'Connor - You'll support the order.

Mr EDMUNDS - And you won't. I'd appreciate not being interrupted. I've had a very hard month, member for Hobart. Every other thing that comes to this House, bar a few that have been introduced by members of this Chamber, such as the member for Mersey and the member for Rosevears, in my memory, have been already voted on downstairs, and the Greens political party and the Australian Labor Party and, indeed, the Liberal Party have voted on those things, yet they're still included in the briefings. I think, to the interjection I just received, I don't understand what is different about this bill, and I would like to be included from now on.

So, yes, putting aside my own engagement, which I have outlined, and continues to occur with stakeholders whether directly or indirectly affected by this order, whether they might be other sporting organisations, the Council, people involved in planning sport and everything else under the sun in this state who I have engaged with, and indeed other members of my party have as well, I would like to be included in the government briefings. I really do welcome the opportunity to be able to sit opposite the TPC, and I will be raising with them the difference in their tone in correspondence with members of my party and a different member of the parliament who asked exactly the same question. I think it's very inconsistent and very disappointing.

[12.57 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, before I speak to this motion, I also commend the member for Montgomery on his inaugural speech. Close, very common boundary, and I did take those hilly bits off you in the last redistribution, but it was actually off your mum I took them, yes, when I picked up those really hilly bits of Burnie. I commend you on that presentation and the story you told. It was lovely.

Speaking fairly briefly, I'm not sure if I'll quite finish by 1 o'clock, but in relation to this motion, I just want to read in parts of the response that has been tabled by the member for Nelson in the context of the work that the committee is being tasked to do here. I note the comments from the member for Pembroke as well, regarding the response that the Labor Party had to a similar request.

I read this quote from their letter or email to the member for Nelson based on the fact that I thought - and I'm happy if she wants to correct me if I'm wrong in her reply, but I thought the intention was to try to further understand some of the stuff that led to it or how the decisions were made beyond what was in the report. I draw members' attention to what is the fourth paragraph here. It said this is not with regard to whether or not they'd appear, but:

The panel members wish to make it clear that they would not respond to questions that relate to issues concerning ongoing public and parliamentary discussions -

I'll just pause there, because the member for Nelson's contribution talked about the ongoing questions and criticism from the government of this report or ignoring of the report, and questions raised about it. I'm not sure we're going to have a chance to get a lot more. I didn't have a chance to see this before we started this debate. So, I'm just reflecting on it as we consider it. It goes on:

in relation to the proposal for the multipurpose stadium at Macquarie Point, subsequent to the submission of their reports, unless such questions were directly relevant to the matters the subject of the reports.

There is probably a slight typo there. So, they're saying that unless it relates to the report and what's in the report - and there's all the information on the website that feeds into that report - they won't be able to answer it or they won't answer it. That's what they've said fairly clearly in the letter. I'm wondering after reading that, whether there is some expectation that we're going to get anything more than what is already on the public record.

Sitting suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.


RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

Mr PRESIDENT - I would like to welcome to the Chamber the grade 5 and 6 students from Andrews Creek Primary School in the electorate of Mersey.

Welcome to the Legislative Council. We're about to do Question Time, which is where members of the Legislative Council can ask questions to the government through the Leader or to the ministers we have in this Chamber directly.

Mr Gaffney - Mr President, you hadn't heard about Andrews Creek before?

Mr PRESIDENT - Of course I have. I'm sure, along with the the member for Mersey, who is your local member in the Legislative Council -

Ms Rattray - They're strong advocates, Mr President.

Mr PRESIDENT - all other members will join me in making you welcome to the Legislative Council.

Members - Hear, hear.


QUESTIONS

Housing - Wait Times

Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER for HOUSING and PLANNING, Mr VINCENT

[2.32 p.m.]
The latest Homes Tasmania dashboard reports the private rental vacancy rates in Hobart, Burnie and Launceston were 0.4 per cent, 0.3 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively, as at the end of September this year.

Median statewide rent for houses was just under $500 a week in the June 2025 quarter, an increase of 4.2 per cent from the June quarter of last year. There's been a decrease in building approvals following a national trend, while the average wait time for priority applicants from the housing register is 82.6 weeks at the end of September 2025. That's almost seven years, and the housing registers soared to its highest level ever with 5336 applicants on the register, up from 4892 at the same time last year.

Clearly, whatever your government is doing to address the housing crisis is not working. You are the new minister. What are your plans for reversing this worrying trend?

ANSWER

Mr President, may I have my back to you while I address the member for Hobart, please?

Good questions. Certainly, over the last eight weeks, I have buried myself into the social and affordable housing of this portfolio especially, along with the planning complications that come with it. I would like to give you a great big answer like so many people do in the press or try to, but you will certainly get an honest one. To make it probably a little bit worse on some of those stats you just pointed out, yesterday the mainland story was that the difference between private ownership and investment ownership of homes in Australia has also increased to the investor side of things by about - I can't remember - but it's now 62 per cent, I think. The fact that to construct a house on average in Australia, also in the last 12 months, have gone up by 6 per cent.

We've got to be realistic and say, I can't see an easy way around the numbers not continuing to grow. What I can be really serious and passionate about is the fact that a lot of things that have been happening over the last couple of years with Homes Tasmania in the culmination of a lot of the housing supply orders and the accumulation of land that is going through various degrees of planning, will and should see sensible increase in the amount of homes being built next year, all things being fair and equal.

Huntingfield has been talked about an enormous amount, but when you actually dig into that - that's what my office has been doing over the last five weeks - it is not a pretty story involving everything from EPBs, environmental reports to council, Homes Tasmania. All aspects of that subdivision being so big, is complications that I never appreciated, even at my level in the building and council network, until we delved into it. 

It was also highlighted in some of my travels around the state - and I should reach out to the people that run Youth2Independence in Devonport, we spent a bit of time there last week meeting some of the kids in that transitional crisis care. How amazing it is.

However, over 50 per cent of the home market now is not the traditional three- and four-bedroom home that most of us have grown up understanding and appreciating. It is about one- and two-bedroom units, which changes our concept in planning towards a different way and size of blocks, and how you fit some of those developments in with conventional subdivision layouts.

Ms O'Connor - How about some medium density?

Mr VINCENT - Yes, and I've also been out to talk to Glenorchy Council about the corridor and that medium density. I've gathered a lot of information. There are certainly quite a few small bits of the planning scheme, or slight changes or interpretations, that we can make to help this situation. 

What I was already aware of, and which has become more apparent in looking at many of the industry issues, is that the interpretation of so many well-meaning council planners on the same sort of thing is not good, and it's not conducive to consistency with builders working in several municipalities. We have to look, and have been looking, with the state planning office, at how we can tidy up the interpretations.

There are a lot of little - I won't even say one-per-centers at the moment - they're all little half-per-centers that will add up to a different approach leading into 2026. I've found it draining but exciting, and every rock we turn over we find quite a few issues, but we also find some pretty sensible ways through some of these smaller issues. Some of the bigger ones we will work through, but I hope that gives you some idea on what we've been looking at and finding and appreciating, so that we can make a difference leading into and during 2026.


Supplementary Question

[2.37 p.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - Mr President, may I have a supplementary question?

Mr PRESIDENT - The member for Hobart.

Ms O'CONNOR - Mr President, I was disappointed to hear the minister say it, and I wonder if it was a slight slip - that on the basis of the statistics in the detail of my question that you can't see the numbers not continuing to grow. 

Related to your answer is the fate of the former K&D site in central Nipaluna/Hobart. As you would know, there is a new buyer - a new owner - for that site, and that owner is reported in the Mercury's real estate pages as saying that they want to make sure that the site realises its full potential and they're happy to work with governments on making sure that there is capacity there for social and affordable housing with mixed-use and businesses at ground level. Are you able to update the Council on any conversations about that site and also to commit, as the minister, to working with the new owner to help that site realise its full potential?

Mr PRESIDENT - That was another question, but I will allow the minister to answer that question.

ANSWER

I have not had any conversations directly over the last eight weeks regarding the K&D site because it has been in commercial transition with new owners, and I haven't been informed who those new owners are yet. What I can say is that Homes Tasmania and other people involved in looking at the K&D site have had sensible conversations about partnering. 

One of the interesting things that I didn't touch on in my other answer is the fact that the commercial viability of quite a few of these projects, especially when you're looking at commercial businesses mixing in with the density of residential places, is quite complex and expensive for quite a few reasons. That is the reason why there have to be more conversations between housing providers, whether it's commonwealth or whether it's Homes Tasmania, into working with commercial operators to get that viability of sites like K&D right. As that information comes available, I'm happy to bring it back to the House.


Teachers - Wage Negotiations

Ms LOVELL question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[2.39 p.m.]
You said this morning that during wage negotiations, the Education Union lodged its log of claims in September and began taking industrial action in October - but it's not quite as simple as that. The Public Sector Union Wages Agreement Log of Claims was actually served on 20 May this year. That claim is for teacher assistants, school administration staff and others; those workers are due a pay rise in the first pay period of December. 

The Education Union lodged a separate claim for their teachers in September, the one you referred to, but teachers aren't due to receive a pay rise until March, which means there is still plenty of time to negotiate a fair deal in good faith. Given that this is the case, minister, why were they given the same ultimatum as everyone else, before even having the chance to begin negotiations?

ANSWER

Mr President, I will seek some advice. Yes, with regards to the questions in the other place this morning, I was referring to the log of claims with the Australian Education Union that obviously sit in my space. That's what I was referring to. 

I think there are negotiations in a number of spaces with a number of different unions, across not just our teachers, but other school workers as well. I've certainly met with those unions. I've really appreciated the honest and frank conversations that I've had with the members who have shared their experiences with me, which has been great, but again: I'm not the negotiator, I'm not the lead wage negotiator. That is always done at arms-length of government. What I've tried to do is just make sure that I am listening, and that I'm able to feed back any information that comes to me so that it is part of those conversations. I do that through my secretary. 

I want to see both sides, the lead wage negotiator and our unions, come in good faith to the table and be having those discussions. For me, as Education Minister, those discussions can't be happening while I've got school closures. I again ask the unions and the lead negotiator to be at the table in good faith. Let's work through this to get a fair and reasonable outcome.

Marinus Link - North West Transmission Developments - Strategic Benefit Payments

Ms FORREST question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[2.43 p.m.]
I've been informed that the strategic benefit payment for landowners affected by the Marinus Link transmission line - North West Transmission Developments will only be paid to those who sign up for the option agreement before 1 December. My questions are: is this the case, and if so, could this be regarded as either unconscionable conduct or as an unfair contract under Australian consumer law?

ANSWER

Mr President, I will seek some advice. Let me begin by reiterating our government's commitment to the Marinus Link, Project Marinus, as a hugely important project for the state of Tasmania. It is the backbone of our energy agenda. It is the single piece that will put us on a course to the Tasmanian Renewable Energy Target (TRET), the 200 per cent renewable target that we have here legislated in Tasmania. Obviously after the 2024 election, shareholder ministers - 

Ms Forrest - The question was pretty specific. 

Mr DUIGAN - I will get to the question, thank you very much. But I will use my time as much as I like to talk about my understanding, and how we have arrived at the place that we have arrived at, thank you. Now, where was I?

In 2024, shareholder ministers issued a revised statement of expectations to TasNetworks, asking them to develop a fair and contemporary compensation framework for farmers through consultation for the North West Transmission Developments. As a result, TasNetworks has been progressing land access arrangements for the North West Transmission Development with, of course, the principal delivery of compensation. That is via the Land Acquisition Act 1993, where individual business circumstances or landholder circumstances will be examined. If there are injuries determined, that would be fed in as part of the compensation provided, and that's by way of the Valuer-General.

There are access-fee payments, participation payments, option-fee payments, there is community benefit sharing. I'm pleased to say that we have finalised the detail for our strategic benefit payment, which is a nationally consistent payment for private landholders impacted by the North West Transmission Developments, and will be over and above any other compensation payments that landowners may be eligible for. It does align with NSW and Victoria: $200,000 per kilometre over 20 years and 25 years respectively in those jurisdictions. It is seen as a way of opening the gate and facilitating those discussions to get landholders engaged in that process.

I was very pleased, I must say, to be at Gawler the other day at the farm of Adam Wardrop, and Richard Smith [names tbc] was there, to hear about how TasNetworks have been engaging with those farmers, noting that this is a transmission line which is, in very large part, an upgrade of an existing transmission line, but these farmers had seen a reduction in the number of towers that they would host for the new transmission line, because the towers, while they are larger and taller, there are fewer of them. Richard Smith currently has 10 towers; he will end up having eight because they are spaced further apart. 

There will also be a better alignment, which has been changed, for his business and his opportunity to run pivot irrigation and things of that nature. That is indeed a net benefit for his business. In terms of what the strategic benefit payment is for, it is to encourage landholders to open the gate, to be part of the process, and at some point that time will elapse. TasNetworks will continue to work with farmers and continue to work with landowners. We want them all to be on the journey with us, because we think we have developed what is a very, very fair and reasonable compensation package and incentive for them to join with us.

Supplementary Question


[2.48 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, that question was not answered at all. May I have a supplementary question?

Mr PRESIDENT - The member for Hobart.

Ms FORREST - I will be very specific. I appreciate the filibustering of understanding all the things I knew about the process. The question was and remains, with regard to the strategic benefit payment, I've been informed that farmers or landowners will need to sign up for the proposed option that the minister referred to by 1 December. Is this the case? He talked about a possible end date. Is 1 December, or the beginning of December, the date? If it is, and farmers or landowners are being pressured to sign by that date, could it be regarded as unconscionable conduct or an unfair contract under Australian consumer law?

Mr DUIGAN - Mr President, the government has set the framework for the strategic benefit payment. It is TasNetworks' responsibility to deliver on the North West Transmission Developments. The 1 December deadline for the SBP has been set to ensure the project can be delivered on time and on budget; TasNetworks communicated this to landowners in June 2025. TasNetworks is committed to collaborating with all landowners who have not signed up by 1 December and will work with them on a case-by-case basis.


Consumer Goods Bicycle Helmets Safety Standard 2024 - Adoption of Standard

Mr EDMUNDS question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

[2.50 p.m.]
My question is regarding the urgent adoption of the Consumer Goods Bicycle Helmets Safety Standard 2024. Retailers are very concerned about the delay in adopting the Consumer Goods Bicycle Helmets Safety Standard 2024 into Tasmanian legislation. Suppliers are saying they cannot ship bicycle helmets to Tasmania until the new standard has been formally adopted, as their new helmet stock is only compliant with the new unadopted standard. With Christmas fast approaching this situation has serious implications for retailers, the economy and for community safety. These standards are not new, and the government has had 18 months to implement the change. Can you assure retailers and guarantee t [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.2_D=2.8_C=0.83] hat these new safety standards will be in place this year?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=34.2_D=28.0_C=0.81] Mr President, I have signed the paperwork for that to go through the process for being approved and changed so they can be available for retailers for this Christmas. Obviously, Christmas is the largest single sales time for helmets that fit this. I was certainly amazed to find out on the regulations [Bookmark: Phr4_O=63.4_D=2.0_C=0.56] , both Australian and New Zealand regulations [Bookmark: Phr5_O=65.8_D=20.4_C=0.78]  plus there are four different international regulations that do pass the standards and there's also issues with seats that wear head dress and exceptions in amongst the regulations. All that has been signed and we are progressing that as quickly as we can to make that available for the retailers for the Christmas service.


Illawarra Road - Classification

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=87.3_D=29.5_C=0.72] Ms FORREST question to MINISTER FOR INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

[2.50 p.m.]
Landowners along Illawarra Road remain concerned about the Department of State Growth's plan to convert this agricultural corridor into a highway-standard freight route. The 2015 reclassification of Illawarra Road into a national network [? Inaudible 2.5150] to a highway network occurred without consultation or assessment of suitability. Since the Perth Bypass opened travel times savings are negligible. The road is still promoted as the preferred route [Bookmark: Phr7_O=117.0_D=26.4_C=0.62]  between the northern ports and Hobart instead of the existing Bass and Midland highways, which are designated for the purpose. Illawarra Road is a working rural corridor used starting for moving machinery and stock. Overtaking lanes beside property entrances and [P/G? 2.52.14] turns will force tractors and stock trucks to move across three lanes of 100 kilometre an hour traffic, an obvious safety hazard. Allowing a heavy freight vehicles on this road greatly increase the collision risk. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=144.2_D=5.8_C=0.42]  Safety options such as the 80 kilometre per hour limit, a centre turning lane or widening of the Bass Highway under parks have been ignored. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=150.8_D=16.2_C=0.75] 

My question to the minister is, will the minister order an immediate safety and risk assessment of the Illawarra Road upgrade, meet with landowners on site and review the project's cost benefit and viability to determine whether continuing this over budget, high risk project remains justified?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=171.0_D=9.7_C=0.66] Mr President, yes Illawarra Road has been a very large part of what I've needed to look at since taking on the ministry some 12 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=181.1_D=11.8_C=0.83]  months ago. I have also been out and visited three of the main farmers in the area and had one-on-one conversations with them. I have also [Bookmark: Phr12_O=194.6_D=15.8_C=0.73]  been in discussions with the Department of State Growth and the deputy secretary who has also been out there directly involved with talking to the people and those conversations are continuing to take place. For as long as I can remember, as originally a Devonport/Latrobe boy [Bookmark: Phr13_O=210.9_D=8.1_C=0.71] , Illawarra Road has been the shortcut, and it was worked out as part of the national [Bookmark: Phr14_O=220.0_D=23.9_C=0.77]  road structure for heavy transport that needed an upgrade. The first part of that project from the boundary of Meander Council out to the highway is under construction now and widening of that. The power poles, I understand, have been moved this week to allow for the widening to occur now.

Ms Forrest - To the Bass Highway you are talking about?

Mr VINCENT - Yes, out to the Bass Highway from the Meander [Bookmark: Phr15_O=245.3_D=4.8_C=0.77]  Municipal boundary through and there are a couple more sections done. A couple of years ag [Bookmark: Phr16_O=250.4_D=16.4_C=0.76] o the Longford roundabout was part of that process, and another section is up the top that most people know because of all Hugh McKinnon's strawberry and raspberry shells there. There are some major safety issues with that section of road. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=267.8_D=14.9_C=0.80]  I can assure you that discussions are still taking place with the owners. It is a vital part of the structure through there and the road is already being used by these heavy transport operators, therefore the safety and the upgrades of the roa [Bookmark: Phr18_O=283.8_D=2.5_C=0.88] d are required to meet a standard.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=288.5_D=13.3_C=0.79] The Commissioner for Road Safety - I think I have that term right or transport - has been out. That is why the speed limit was addressed on our request for it to have a look. She has gone out to have a look and the decision she makes is totally independent [Bookmark: Phr20_O=302.4_D=2.6_C=0.60] . We will continue our discussion for those farmers there.


TasTAFE Course Reductions

Ms WEBB question to LEADER for the GOVERNMENT in the LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Ms RATTRAY

[2.55 p.m.]

Detail whether any stakeholder consultation, including with staff and students, occurred before the subsidy redirections were finalised, and if so, which stakeholders were consulted and when;
In relation to each of the Laboratory Certificate IV and Diploma in Laboratory Technology courses, detail:

The class size capacity of the current TasTAFE laboratory facilities

The class enrolment numbers for each course for the last five calendar years

The graduation rate for each of these courses for the last five years

The gender breakdown of both enrolled students and teaching staff for each 	course over five years;

Provide any evidence-based data and analysis regarding the reported low enrolments for all identified 12 courses of the last three calendar years;

Confirm whether any gender impact assessment of the proposed subsidy redirections was undertaken to inform this decision, and if not, why not?;

Detail the estimated savings of the redirection of subsidies from these identified 12 courses, and;

Detail which courses will be the recipient of the redirected subsidies, and any evidence-based data and analysis upon which that decision was based?

ANSWER

Mr President, I want to check with the member who asked the question. There's a table that's part of the response; is the member happy for me to table the whole lot?

Ms Webb - Yes

Ms RATTRAY - Thank you. I move -

Voluntary Council Amalgamation

Ms WEBB question to MINISTER for LOCAL GOVERNMENT, Mr VINCENT

[2.57 p.m.]
For clarity, this is a follow-up from our previous sitting week in September, and a question that the Minister for Local Government endeavoured to get back to me on. I will put the questions that were the ones I put into the Chamber then relating to review of councillor numbers and allowances being undertaken, and their relationship to the Future of Local Government Review report.

The questions are:

Has the phase 1 voluntary amalgamation program as recommended by the 2023 review report been undertaken?

If so, can you detail when and how that was undertaken and the outcomes of that program?

Can you confirm that the current review into the councillor numbers and allowances is being undertaken by the Office of Local Government within DPAC and not, in fact, an independent reviewer specifically recommended by that 2023 Future of Local Government Review report, and explain why the government deviated from that part of recommendation 34?

ANSWER

Mr President, the answers to (1) and (2) are that the government is continuing to support the voluntary amalgamation program as part of its priority reform program. It is unlikely any voluntary amalgamations will be completed before the 2026.

With regards to question (3), the Local Government Act 1993 provides for changes to councillor numbers be made by the Governor on the recommendation of the minister, but only in response to the outcomes of a Local Government Board Review. This process does not involve parliamentarians.

The alternate option is for the changes to be enacted through an amendment to the act and for Parliament - not just the minister - to have its say on the amendments.

Informing recommendation 34 of the Future of Local Government Review was the review board’s view on how many elected representatives are needed to effectively serve the needs of a particular community, and the merits of having fewer councillors who are remunerated at a higher level versus a greater number of councillors on relatively lower allowances.

Considering this, as well as the ongoing advocacy from the sector for a review to occur irrespective of amalgamations, the government decided to bring forward the numbers and allowances review. The government has determined not to undertake a local government board review. This is because would incur substantial costs due to procedural elements hardwired into the act in respect to such reviews, likely taking too long for the outcomes to be implemented ahead of the 2026 elections. This would mean any change would not be in place until the 2030 elections. Instead, internal capability to undertake a technical review of councillor numbers and allowances was identified within the Office of Local Government, and proposed reforms have been developed transparently and now open with the broad community consultation. Thank you.

Ms Webb - Another question?

Mr PRESIDENT - Yes, I will just allow this one because we were slightly late starting questions.


Multi-School Organisations Trial

Ms WEBB question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[3.01 p.m.]
It's a follow-up from our last sitting week on 24 September, so I appreciate the opportunity. It is, I think, for the honourable minister for Education - the set of questions related to the Multi-School Organisations (MSO) reforms, the trials that have been proposed. The question I was seeking to get an answer to, and I hopefully will today, was in terms of consultation on the Multi-School Organisations trial. Was there a proposal developed and described in, say, an issues paper or background paper, and put out for consultation with relevant groups, many of whom were listed in answers to questions that were occurring at the time, but specifically teachers, principals, the AEU, the Tasmanian Association of State School Organisations? For example, was a Multi-School Organisations trial a definite model put to them? Were their thoughts gathered and considered before we arrived at the proposal that's now being taken forward under a trial? Did that form of consultation occur, or were there just meetings and briefings along the way?

———————————————————
Recognition of Visitors

Mr PRESIDENT - While the minister makes her way to the lectern, I'd just like to welcome the second group through from grades 5 and 6 from Andrews Creek, which we all know is in Wesley Vale, in the electorate of Mersey. Welcome to the Council. We're having Question Time at the moment, and the minister's just about to answer a question proposed by the member for Nelson.
———————————————————
ANSWER

Mr President, it's lovely to have some of our students in the Chamber with us today.

We want to support our educators to lift student outcomes. That's why we're trialling Multi-School Organisations, an education model based on international best practice that has transformed outcomes in disadvantaged schools. The Grattan Institute produced a report, 'Spreading success: Why Australia should trial multi-school organisations', which recommends MSO trials in every state and territory. Tasmania is leading the nation in this evidence-based approach, and I'm really proud of that.

The Independent Education Review involved extensive consultation with education stakeholders. It also found merit in trialling Multi-School Organisations. We've listened carefully to the experts on what works, and we are adapting the MSO model to a Tasmanian context. Between September 2024 and June 2025, there was an extensive consultation with principals and education stakeholders on grouping schools and child and family learning centres into communities. I'm advised that there were 1935 pieces of staff and stakeholder input received through 192 meetings, presentations and drop-in sessions.

A core focus of the engagement was to constantly feed back to staff and stakeholders what we heard and how the feedback was shaping our reform work. This consultation is informing how we move forward with the MSO trial, due to the similarities in approach and shared purpose to improve learner outcomes by supporting educators and ensuring access to resources and services are maximised. Specifically, feedback has helped to inform work on reducing confusion around reporting lines and introducing a single point of contact for principals. It looks at reducing the administrative load for principals with the introduction of the operations manager role for MSO and executive leads for groupings of schools, the importance of geography as a design element of collaboration. 

An MSO steering committee was also established in May to provide oversight, guidance, and support for the trial, with membership including education experts and local stakeholders such as Ms Jane Bovill, a former Tasmanian school principal, and Dr Tony Luttrell, a former Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority board member. 

In relation to consultation directly on the MSO trial, let's be clear: this is a model that will evolve over time in response to feedback from educators and education stakeholders, who I consider genuine partners in our approach, which is nation leading. There is no consultation document; however, there is an ongoing consultation process, as there needs to be. We're committed to ensuring education stakeholders and unions have an important voice in this reform.

That's why they've been invited to participate in an advisory group which will provide input on the commissioning framework and on the evaluation. This is a five-year trial. It will be gradual, and it will be considered, with an independent evaluation process which will allow us to learn, refine and scale what works best for Tasmanian learners and educators, which is our priority. Thank you for the question.


Supplementary Question

Ms WEBB (Nelson) - A supplementary question.

Mr PRESIDENT - The member for Nelson.

Ms WEBB - Just to clarify, because there was a lot of detail in that answer, not much of it toward the answer, but some of it, I just wanted to clarify there in the midst of it: did the consultation occur after the decision had been made to do the trial, largely not before the decision was made to do the trial, to shape the trial and to shape the concept?

Ms PALMER - Mr President, no, I don't agree with how you've framed that. We came back from the UK, having seen something extraordinary, which was ticking a box and answering the feedback that was coming to me constantly as Education Minister around student outcomes, first and foremost, but also around a sustainable workforce, a happy workforce, and an engaged workforce. 

We came back and we started having those conversations with stakeholders, obviously with my department. From there, the more that we talked, the more that we had those conversations, it became an absolute reality that this was a direction the state should be going in. It was then a policy decision that we would move in that direction, slowly and carefully and consulting as we go. That consultation will continue throughout the entire five-year trial to make sure that we adapt where we need to adapt, that we hold the line where we need the hold the line, and not taking our eyes off the goal, which is to see better outcomes for our students and better outcomes for our teaching workforce.


MOTION
Macquarie Point Stadium - Tasmanian Planning Commission - Committee Establishment

Resumed from above (page xx).

[3.08 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, I'm glad the Clerk had trouble remembering where we were at, I've had trouble remembering exactly where I was at when the 1 o'clock bell dinged. I will just step back, perhaps to reiterate that I was raising the question about how much more information we would actually be likely to achieve through this process. The Tasmanian Planning Commission made pretty clear in their correspondence to the member for Nelson that they would not respond to questions relating to issues concerning ongoing public and parliamentary discussions in relation to the proposal for a multi-purpose stadium at Macquarie Point, subsequent to the submission of their reports, unless such questions would be directly relevant to the matters the subject of the report.

Rightly so, they have put a really clear caveat around that because if they were questioned and expected to reveal information that perhaps wasn't in the report, or maybe wasn't something they agreed with in the information that was provided, then I think that would give the government a free kick to criticise them further. I just think we need to be a little bit cautious about that. They are an independent office, as has been mentioned by others. That response the member for Pembroke read out was pretty clear in that, that they were an independent office and they have a job to do. Maybe the member for Nelson could inform us if she knows, is it a ministerial appointment for each of the panels? I haven't had a chance to have a look at that to see [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.4_D=19.8_C=0.82] , and what implications there could be for them. I also further note that toward the end of the email that was sent to the member for Nelson, it says:

Finally, the members of the panel consider that any formal request must be made by way of summons to attend parliament.

This obviously provides a level of protection for them, because they can't say no. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=52.2_D=7.7_C=0.82]  To say no or not come would be contempt of parliament. I know that in the past, and some committees, when [Bookmark: Phr4_O=61.0_D=2.7_C=0.89]  public servants or others - and these are public servants [Bookmark: Phr5_O=65.6_D=9.1_C=0.69]  - are reluctant to appear before a committee, have said they would do so under summons, because it does mean they can't refuse so the minister can't stop them [Bookmark: Phr6_O=75.5_D=11.4_C=0.76]  attending. The minister could try to interfere with that, but we're talking about a contempt of parliament here. 

So I'm not sure it's an overly willing appearance, which takes me back to the communication the member for Pembroke [Bookmark: Phr7_O=89.0_D=6.1_C=0.64]  read out saying that they didn't think it was really appropriate. I want to make those points. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=97.0_D=7.9_C=0.69]  When I read through this when it was tabled earlier today in responding to the [Bookmark: Phr9_O=105.3_D=16.3_C=0.82]  motion before us, I thought it's not an overly willing appearance perhaps, but that's my interpretation of what's in that letter, or the email or communication that was provided to the Labor Party who made a similar request, according to the member for Pembroke.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=123.1_D=10.2_C=0.79] I'm wondering who else the member for Nelson talked to about this, or whether it was just the TPC, or were there other people that she'd consulted with to determine this is the best way forward [Bookmark: Phr11_O=135.2_D=0.7_C=0.84]  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=137.2_D=1.0_C=0.59] ?  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=140.2_D=10.0_C=0.80] I know this is a very tight terms of reference, and I appreciate the purpose of that, but there may be expectations in the community that if we're going to hear from the TPC under privilege and under oath, and thus covered by parliamentary privilege, why wouldn't we hear from several other key stakeholders who've got a very important role to play in helping us inform our decisions about the order we will deal with in December? 

Ms O'Connor - Like who?

Ms FORREST - Well, MPDC, perhaps, under oath.

Ms O'Connor - They've briefed us up the wazoo. 

Ms FORREST - They have briefed [Bookmark: Phr15_O=173.2_D=25.9_C=0.78]  us. Briefings are not under oath. They're not privileged. They are not a formal presenting of the parliament. 

Ms O'Connor - Sure. 

Ms FORREST - I'm just raising the point. You can have your opinion. I'm raising a point that you may set up a public expectation that if this is okay for them, why don't you hear from the others in a formal setting like this? I'm raising that point because there have been other committee inquiries that have been done where we've had what we've called a targeted, or [Bookmark: Phr16_O=200.4_D=0.5_C=0.24]  a SIP  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=202.5_D=24.4_C=0.78] - short inquiry process - where we haven't gone right out for a broad consultation. There has been criticism that we've only heard from certain parties that were targeted by that committee. 

I'm conscious of that with this really contentious project we're dealing with. I'm just raising it. I'm not saying it for any other reason than to raise it, but we potentially set ourselves up for some criticism and give [Bookmark: Phr18_O=227.4_D=0.6_C=0.72]  naysayers [Bookmark: Phr19_O=230.2_D=1.8_C=0.87]  the opportunity to further [Bookmark: Phr20_O=232.2_D=14.1_C=0.74]  criticise the TPC, which I think was entirely inappropriate in that, as I believe the member for Nelson herself said, within a very short period of the report hitting the deck, the government are saying, thanks very much, but no [Bookmark: Phr21_O=247.3_D=5.4_C=0.86] . They could not have had time to properly consider everything that was in that report [Bookmark: Phr22_O=254.7_D=11.4_C=0.79] , and had obviously already formed an opinion on it soon after it landed. I'm just conscious of setting up unreal expectations within the community.

 [Bookmark: Phr23_O=267.0_D=6.0_C=0.89] I'm suggesting that we need to be cautious of that; not that we shouldn't do this, but that we should be cautious of that [Bookmark: Phr24_O=276.3_D=6.2_C=0.85] , and it will be really important that the committee, should it be established, [Bookmark: Phr25_O=284.3_D=0.6_C=0.70]  heeds carefully [Bookmark: Phr26_O=285.7_D=19.3_C=0.81]  that request of the TPC not to ask questions that relate to matters of ongoing and parliamentary discussions, unless they relate specifically to what's already publicly known and in that report. I believe it's going to need to be a carefully balanced act to ensure that we don't put the TPC in a position that could see them, and their independence, compromised. 

I'm just raising those points. It doesn't appear to me to be a willing 'yes, we'll come'. There are caveats around it, which is fine. Of course they should do that. However, I am conscious that there was a previous communication that had quite a different approach. I'm not sure why it changed.

[3.15 p.m.]
Ms THOMAS (Elwick) - Mr President, I thank other honourable members for their contributions. I rise to support the motion, and I thank the member for bringing it to us. I certainly support the intent of the motion here. As I've said all along in relation to the proposed stadium at Macquarie Point, this is an important decision, a significant decision, and one that will have long-lasting impacts for future generations whichever way it goes.

Therefore, it's critical that members are provided with as much information as possible, and answers to questions we have of the government, of the people who have assessed the project, and of the government entities who are involved. Having the opportunity to ask the TPC panel members to clarify or further explain the findings that they made in the recommendation report will be helpful in informing our decision-making here. Doing so in a hearing that is open to the public, broadcast live, recorded on the parliamentary record in Hansard, and in which witnesses are sworn under oath, for transparency and for the protection of panel members is, of course, fair and reasonable. 
	
However - and I hope I don't get the same reactions, because I give members the respect of listening without interjecting, and I feel like we all should be free in this place to ask questions in our contributions and to share an opinion without fear of being criticised or belittled. I'd like to hear more from the member for Nelson about what other options were considered, if any, to achieve the aim of hearing from the TPC committee. 

I do have some concern that other parties, including the proponent in the Macquarie Point Development Corporation and other government entities tied up in this complex structure, are not afforded the opportunity to participate in a hearing and give evidence under the same conditions as we are suggesting we'll provide to the TPC through this committee structure we are considering here today.

I have some concern that members don't have the opportunity to hear from those other entities under those same conditions. Stadiums Tasmania, even TASCORP, DPAC and State Growth all have the opportunity to brief members through private briefings. Yes, I understand and accept that. However, what is proposed through this committee is an entirely different environment.

I have to ask myself in making this decision, Mr President, is this fair and equitable? Or are there other potential amendments that could be made or other options that have been considered that would perhaps be more fair and equitable, all those things considered? 

I wonder, did the member consider referring the entire order to a committee or establishing a committee with a broader remit, to hear from more than just the TPC, from some of those other entities I mentioned as well, under those same conditions? Those briefings that we have with those entities aren't open to the public. They're not broadcast, there's no record in Hansard, and they're not sworn under oath. Of course, Mr President, I've requested to be on the committee. My name's on the motion and I am supportive of the intent. I'm also, in some ways, loathe to suggest further agonising the people of Tasmania by suggesting an expanded committee and another hearing process to further scrutinise what is a seriously divisive issue when, to be frank, people out there are sick of hearing about it. They just want us to decide - but it is a tough decision, a big decision, with significant impacts whichever way it goes.

I know many members have already spoken, but I'd appreciate hearing whether other members have any similar concerns or suggestions around some of those fairness and equity issues. I'd appreciate hearing the member for Nelson's thoughts on the fairness and equity issue, not on hearing from the TPC, because of course I believe it's fair and equitable that we do. We have heard from other those other entities, I know. I'm talking about the fairness and equity in the process, and the conditions by which we hear from them compared to others who have skin in the game. 

[3.20 p.m.]
Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, I thank members who made contributions on the motion. I appreciate that, and some of the support expressed in those contributions. It is quite right we would all turn our mind to consider what's before us in this place in a motion and to be free to ask questions about it and that's not a problem.

One thing I would note before I start is that when I got up to first move this motion, I neglected to acknowledge that just before I did that, we'd had the inaugural speech from the member for Montgomery, which was just wonderful. We all found it heartfelt. I welcome him, thank him for that lovely contribution to our Chamber, and we look forward to working as colleagues in this Chamber with you. I apologise I was so focused on doing something out of the ordinary with moving a motion without notice that I neglected to do it in my opening remarks. Welcome.

I note for clarity that one of the reasons I moved this as a motion without notice in this place at this time is because in order for something like this and a hearing to occur as part of the process prior to us considering the order the government intends to bring to us in the first week of December, which is our understanding, this was the only private members' day available to establish a committee and to take it forward. In my opening contribution I didn't explain that was part of the timing issue and the need for considering a motion without notice rather than the way we'd normally do it with tabling it and then debating it at another time.

I will address a couple of the things brought up in contributions for clarity and put my position on them on the record. First and foremost, I want to make it very clear that my intention here was to find a way for members of this place to be able to engage with the TPC expert panel members on the work that they had done in a way they would find acceptable and appropriate. That's purely the function of establishing this committee because, on engaging with them about it, it was clear it would need to be a formal parliamentary process rather than an informal process of any kind.

There are a couple of things about that to elaborate on in response to matters raised. First, in relation to the member for Pembroke's concerns about a lack of consistency perhaps in the response received, I see it as entirely consistent. The panel made it clear, and it's in the email I've tabled, that requests had been made for either individual members or parties to have briefings from the panel members, and they declined that as an acceptable option. My understanding from the interactions I've had with them is that's it is very clear they regard that as a risk of being politicised. In a private briefing, and if you give numerous private briefings, you can't be assured there's consistency always in the information and the engagements that are being provided or even equity and fairness. Then there's always a risk you might be verballed afterwards. Things you may say in a private briefing to a member or a party may then be characterised incorrectly in the public domain. Without wanting to verbal the panel members myself, I'm sharing my understanding of what looks like entire consistency between the panel members declining to brief a party in private on their work and identifying and then accepting the idea that they wanted to do it in a formal mechanism to the parliament. That looks entirely consistent to me.

I would say first and foremost, because the last thing I want to do is do what the panel, I suspect, feared is to be verballed in the public domain by others. I think we've already seen some of that from the government and others. What I would suggest is any of these matters that are coming up in this debate that members may feel there's a lack of clarity around whether it's the motivation of the Tasmanian Planning Commission panel in identifying this mechanism, whether it's the scope of what's been identified that can be discussed and examined in the context of the committee, whether it's consistency or otherwise with responses they provided to others. We could explore, if and when this committee is formed from this process, potentially, as a committee, to write to the panel and ask for clarification, further information on all those matters. They then can explain [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.2_D=19.1_C=0.82]  to us what their view is on those things. That would be a safe and appropriate way for us to engage with them and have more clarity, if from the result of today's debate, members feel there's still a lack of clarity on those things. That's what I'd suggest so we ensure nobody's being mischaracterised here.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=50.9_D=1.7_C=0.83] Having said that, on the member for Murchison's matters raised, which was a question about whether somehow the way things are described in the email I received from Mr John Ramsay mean the panel will not be able to give more information or won't somehow be able to discuss their work with us because of the way it's phrased. The part quoted from the email was that  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=80.5_D=3.2_C=0.81] the panel members wish to make it clear they would not respond to questions that [Bookmark: Phr6_O=84.0_D=14.0_C=0.86]  relate to issues concerning ongoing public or parliamentary discussions in relation to the proposal for a multipurpose stadium at Macquarie Point, subsequent to the submission of their reports, unless such questions were directly relevant to the matters the subject of the reports.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=100.7_D=19.9_C=0.80] The committee - should it be formed - will be able to ask for clarification of that statement if it's required before the hearing process. My understanding of that statement is what they're saying is they can talk about things they took evidence on, that they considered that they fed into and included in their reports [Bookmark: Phr8_O=121.3_D=15.3_C=0.85] , but will not be commenting on things that may have emerged subsequent to their reports being put into the public domain. 

One example that actively came up in my interactions, and as I rang around each member here to discuss this  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=136.8_D=26.2_C=0.81] committee, I raised this example so all of you will be familiar with it if you spoke to me about this committee.

For example, we've had material emerge into the public domain subsequent to the Tasmanian Planning Commission reports being put in the public domain in September. One clear example would be the Coordinator-General's economic assessments he put into an op-ed piece in the Mercury. There's been much public discussion and interaction about that. That's work that emerged after the Tasmanian Planning Commission concluded its work. It is not reflected in its reports. It wasn't taken in evidence by the Tasmanian Planning Commission. As an example, if there were questions put about that work [Bookmark: Phr11_O=178.8_D=10.5_C=0.86]  to the panel in a hearing process by this committee, I imagine based on what they've described here in this letter, they would decline to answer questions about that work [Bookmark: Phr12_O=189.8_D=29.7_C=0.87]  because it doesn't fit into what they've specified.

They're prepared to talk about, and quite rightly, if there were questions about the economic assessments, the economic evidence and the methodologies they used in their reports and reported on. I think that is what they will engage in according to the way I read this response and email. That is one small example to try to illustrate how I understand that we can if and when a committee is formed, we can [Bookmark: Phr13_O=219.8_D=29.9_C=0.84]  certainly get greater clarification for members ahead of a hearing process if that's required so there is no clarity.

I also think it will quite likely be a dynamic matter that would be dealt with within the hearing context. As the member for Murchison also quite rightly pointed out, and I agree, we will need to be mindful of it as a hearing progresses, if that's where we get to with this. I don't believe that the panel members would be backward in coming forward to saying if a question was put to them they felt was [Bookmark: Phr14_O=249.9_D=24.9_C=0.82]  not appropriate or not within the scope of what they're able to speak about, they would quite rightly and quite likely say that's not something we can comment on. I note that the chair of that panel is a former Solicitor-General, or from the Solicitor General's office in the state previously, Mr Paul Turner. Yes, we will tread carefully with that matter. We could seek greater clarification on it.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=275.7_D=4.7_C=0.89] What I read in this email in no way precludes them talking fully about their report [Bookmark: Phr16_O=281.2_D=3.2_C=0.73] , I think questioning them about it, eliciting [Bookmark: Phr17_O=286.2_D=18.6_C=0.83]  responses from them about what our thoughts are or concerns or testing other information that's been asserted to us about their report. All of that is additional information and not available to us right now and not available through any other avenue. It is wrong to suggest that this hearing process somehow won't have the opportunity to draw out any more information than is already in the public domain. We know full well when we get submissions on things, we can always get more information out of a person when we have a talk with them through a hearing process. There is a lot of value in being able to work through, test, talk about and ask questions about material people have included in reports.

One of the things that I think is an interesting concern to raise here on this is whether there's fairness and equity here in setting this process up for the TPC panel and not others. First and foremost, in response to that, I would say as a private member in this place, I've spelled out really clearly my motivations for seeking to find a way forward with this. It's not my job to make this fair and equitable in a broader sense if people think there's a lack of fairness and equity. Any member here, if they felt somebody needed to be heard from in a way that's different to the way we're already hearing from them, could have sought to set up a process. It's really clear that what we have here is not an inquiry into the stadium.

This is not to replicate any question, a broader question, about the stadium. This is a process purely set up to be able to hear from the TPC panel members about their work, because it's the only available mechanism to do that. They've specified it would need to be a parliamentary process. Let's tease that out a tiny bit. Every other stakeholder group has had multiple opportunities to put information forward into the public domain and to discuss it further. There are all sorts of ways, parliamentary and otherwise, that they've been able to do that. They've been able to do it via a PAC process. I was on PAC when we began an inquiry into the stadium-related matters; was it 2022 or 2023? It was quite a long time ago. There's been ongoing scrutiny of this broader stadium issue through the PAC for a number of years.

Much evidence has been brought forward in a parliamentary sense in hearings and submissions through that process, including from the proponent numerous times; the government; other advocates for the stadium; people who are against the stadium; independent experts; all sorts of people have had the opportunity through that PAC process to do that and continue to. In fact, we've had hearings just as recently as last week, I believe, on this matter.

We've had the entire POSS process, which was absolutely designed to be the opportunity for all manner of evidence and submissions and materials to be put forward by anyone, really, who wanted to have a say on the POSS process. Certainly, the whole POSS process is based on the proponent's information and evidence put forward.

We've also had here in a parliamentary sense, questions available in parliament to be put to the government. The government's been able to answer questions for the parliamentary record that we've put to them for years now. That is also ongoing. We've got an estimates process coming up in two weeks' time where we will still be able to put questions directly to the government and receiving answers in a parliamentary sense on this matter.

First and foremost, it's not my job to make it fair and equitable. If that sense of fair and equitable is that somehow, we have to give everybody a go, literally everybody else in the state apart from the panel members has had a go, and continues to have a go, in terms of putting forward their arguments, material, and evidence. They've been able to do it through parliamentary mechanisms and through other mechanisms outside parliament. They've been able to do it through a very favourable media environment. They've been able to do it with the weight of the government behind them.

The only group that we have not been able to engage with about their work is the TPC panel members. It is that looming gap in what we would find valuable and important in our consideration of this matter that I sought to address here, that looming gap of this crucial piece of expert independent advice to the parliament that I thought, and continue to think, is important for us to be able to engage with further, understand better, test ideas against, and come out the other end better informed in our vote.

This select committee being established is purely a mechanism available to us to do that. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=7.6_D=15.2_C=0.84]  I don't believe there is any other mechanism that could be delivered to enable us to do it. That's what I sought advice on, obviously, and I've arrived at this point because there was literally no other. If we'd used another existing committee [Bookmark: Phr3_O=23.3_D=7.5_C=0.78] , we wouldn't have had the availability of all MLCs to engage in the process who wish to, so we couldn't use an existing committee. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=32.5_D=9.6_C=0.87]  If we needed to do somehow a big broader inquiry, we would never have got it done in the time available, plus that's beyond the purpose of this: to hear from the panel.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=44.0_D=8.0_C=0.84] The panel had made it clear, both previously in communications with members or parties, and to me when I put the question to them [Bookmark: Phr6_O=52.7_D=3.4_C=0.88] , that they would not do private briefings or piecemeal briefings. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=57.4_D=15.9_C=0.83]  When I said to them, 'Under what circumstances would you speak to us,' a parliamentary mechanism was the answer. So, when people ask me, 'What other mechanisms did you consider,' I asked them, 'You tell me which ones fit the bill other than the one I've put on the table today for us to consider.'

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=74.2_D=29.7_C=0.84] Let's be clear here: if there's a difference in response from the TPC when an initial question was put to them, 'Could you provide a briefing on your work to members of the Upper House,' and their answer was, not a private briefing in that circumstance. If one group said, 'Oh, what a shame,' and walked away and I said, 'Oh, that's interesting,' what could we do then to make it available? What circumstances could be appropriate [Bookmark: Phr9_O=104.4_D=10.1_C=0.79] ? That might look different, then, in the response, because I actually sought to find a gate in that wall rather than accept there was a wall there. So that's the whole point of this motion.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=115.5_D=20.3_C=0.84] I hope I've clarified a few of those matters for members on the record here in summing up. I certainly appreciate that there appears to be support, and I hope that that's true and we're able to form this committee in order to have a single, on-the-record hearing with the TPC panel members prior to our debate on the order [Bookmark: Phr11_O=137.5_D=2.6_C=0.75] . It's for a specific purpose. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=141.9_D=5.4_C=0.72]  I do not believe there's a need to consider broadening it, and there's certainly no practical manner under [Bookmark: Phr13_O=147.4_D=30.0_C=0.82]  which we could at this point in time. 

If members felt something broader was needed, they could have either thought of it themselves at an earlier date, they could have engaged with me when I even spoke about this with them as I was developing this throughout the last week; but 'I'm sorry, I didn't think of it earlier, could have been good if we'd had a little bit less of a time constraint over us,' I thought of it in the timeframe I thought of it in, and I brought it as promptly and as effectively as I could to this place as an opportunity for us - I think it's going to be a beneficial one [Bookmark: Phr14_O=177.6_D=6.0_C=0.88]  - so I hope members will support us in that, so that we can do our job even better.

Motion agreed to.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=219.7_D=5.5_C=0.66] 
BUDGET ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE BILL 2025 (No. 57)

Second Reading
 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=225.6_D=8.2_C=0.72] 
[3.39 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) -  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=244.5_D=1.2_C=0.86] Mr President [Bookmark: Phr20_O=247.0_D=6.6_C=0.75] . I move -

That the bill be now read the second time. 

Mr President, this bill is about one thing above all else [Bookmark: Phr21_O=254.4_D=15.3_C=0.79] : it's about restoring trust and accountability in the way Tasmania manages its public finances. This bill I introduced sits against the backdrop of a deteriorating budget position and increasing government decisions to add to the already high levels of state debt.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=270.1_D=14.0_C=0.70] Successive warnings from Treasury and independent economists, and from this very parliament's committees, have been met with delay, denial or cosmetic fixes. We are now carrying levels of debt unprecedented in the state's history [Bookmark: Phr23_O=284.4_D=20.6_C=0.83]  with no credible pathway back to surplus. Servicing that debt will increasingly crowd out our ability to invest in the things Tasmanians need, and need most: hospitals, schools, housing and infrastructure. If we do not act now, we will condemn future governments and future generations to less capacity and fewer choices. This bill is not to cut across other committees, such as the Joint Standing Committee on Public Accounts, but to complement the role of this important committee with a greater focus on the decisions leading into the development of the state budget rather than on the expenditure of public monies after approval of parliament, where the Public Accounts Committee's crucial work is done.

Members would also note the reference to the role of the Tasmanian Audit Office as a provision to enable the Auditor-General to report, or provide an opinion, on targets recommended by any relevant report to parliament made by the Auditor-General. This does not offend any provisions in the Audit Act 2008 in that there is no power to direct the Auditor-General. Rather, it would enable reporting against targets set or recommended in relation to performance indicators that would assist to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure by the general government sector or a statutory authority.

The bill seeks to fill a gap in the current assessment and reporting framework to enable the development of measures that are outcomes-focused and can promote improvement; the efficiency and the effectiveness of expenditure of public money. This would enable agencies and statutory authorities to report data to show a clear link between expenditure of money and outcomes achieved as a result of the expenditure. With the establishment of such measures, these can be reported against and subsequently audited.

Let's talk about the purpose of the bill. This bill establishes a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Budget Accountability and Oversight. The purpose is clear: to give parliament, and through parliament the people of Tasmania, a stronger, continuous mechanism to evaluate government financial management, test fiscal sustainability strategies, and make recommendation regarding measures to prepare and protect the state's finances and improve outcomes for Tasmanians. Unlike the annual cycles of budget, revised estimates reports and other financial reports, the committee will provide an ongoing standing framework for scrutiny.

The committee will have a range of functions and powers that are clearly outlined in clause 6 of the bill. In broad terms, the committee will scrutinise budget papers, forward Estimates, agency financial positions and treasurers' reports. 

The committee will also consider the recommendation of targets in respect of steps to be taken by government or a statutory authority, or promote the sustainability of public sector finances. They'll consider the management of public sector net debt, the measures to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government expenditure. 

The committee will have the power to examine, review and report on 

measures taken to achieve fiscal sustainability and other publicly stated fiscal objectives

measures taken to achieve any publicly stated measure of budget repair and fiscal sustainability

measures taken to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government expenditure,
measures taken to ensure the adequacy and stability of sources of revenue for the government,

the development of the budget and budget papers, and

the process of parliamentary scrutiny in respect of the budget.

Mr President, the committee will have the power to examine, review and report on existing legislation relating to or impacting on public sector finances. This will be important to identify legislative barriers to open and transparent reporting of matters related to the management of public sector finances. 

The committee may consider or report on other strategies to improve the ability of government or a statutory authority to achieve fiscal sustainability, and make recommendations to the government or a statutory authority in respect of any matter that is within the functions of the committee.

The committee may also require, and consider a report upon, any matter referred to the committee by either House of parliament. Following due consideration, if the committee does recommend a target, it would require the Treasurer to take into account those when developing a budget for the relevant financial year. The bill has drafted specified steps to report against, but I have proposed amendments, which I'll come to shortly, that in broad terms remove that specific reporting requirement.

Furthermore, if the committee does recommend a target, as outlined under section 6(1)(c), the Auditor-General may - may - in any report or opinion include a statement as to whether, in the opinion of the Auditor-General, the target was met in a relevant financial year. It will have the power to inform itself in any matter it sees fit. Importantly, the reports will be tabled in parliament, and the government will be required to respond within three months, closing that loop of accountability that's too often left dangling. The remit is broad enough to ensure the whole state sector can be considered, to ensure a meaningful approach is taken, and avoids consideration of important matters in isolation. It is also important to note that much of the net debt held on behalf of the state sits outside the general government sector.

This committee will not duplicate the work of the Public Accounts Committee. Instead, it will complement and strengthen it, with a sharper focus on budget repair and fiscal sustainability. Where issues overlap, or if they do overlap, consultation will ensure cooperation, not conflict. 

The bill provides for review of the act after eight years at a maximum and to be completed within 12 months. Notionally, that would be two full election cycles if we went full term. This will have an amendment to make that possible after four years. I will come to that in a moment. 

Before any review commences, the minister and committee must agree on both the person to undertake the review being a person who is appropriately qualified for the task, and the terms of reference for the review. 

The committee is to consult with the Public Accounts Committee on these matters before an agreement is reached. There are provisions for consultation should parliament be prorogued at the time that the review is scheduled.

The provisions in Schedule 1 relate to the membership and meetings of the committee and are in line with other joint standing committees, including the Joint Standing Committees on Public Accounts, Subordinate Legislation and Integrity. 

I have proposed a number of amendments to respond to matters raised with me after the bill was tabled. I believe these will strengthen its constitutional foundation, clarify the relationships between the committee and government, and address concerns raised during consultation. These amendments fundamentally shift the character of the committee from one that might be perceived as directive to one that is clearly advisory and consultative, whilst maintaining its core purpose of providing continuous fiscal oversight. 

The first amendment addresses concerns about the separation of powers by making it crystal-clear that the committee operates within the transactional Westminster model of parliamentary scrutiny through transparency and accountability, not through command.

The second amendment removes potential ambiguous language that could be interpreted as the committee directing how specific aspects of the financial challenge of the state could be managed, which is, and remains, an executive function. The amendment maintains the committee's ability to recommend targets, while making it clear it does not dictate how strategies to achieve these targets should be met. 

The third amendment addresses concerns about the committee potentially interfering in the legislative process. The committee retains power to examine existing legislation that impacts public sector finances but will not examine bills before the parliament. The committee may still identify needs for legislative reform, and recommend that government consider legislative changes, but it will not review specific bills under development. 

The fourth amendment makes a subtle but important change in tone. 'Strategies to improve' may imply an assumption that current strategies are inadequate. I'm on the record saying that strategies are generally appropriate. 'Strategies that may improve' is more neutral and consultative. The committee examines potential improvements without pre-judging current approaches. This recognises that the committee's role is to provide options and analysis, not to presume deficiency. 

The fifth amendment is the most significant, substantive amendment. It does three things. 

It changes 'must take into account' to 'have regard to'. This is critical legal language. 'Have regard to' is a standard formulation used throughout Tasmanian legislation where a parliament requires consideration without mandating compliance. It appears in the Financial Management Act 2016 itself regarding the principles of sound fiscal management.

It removes the detailed reporting requirements from subsection 6(3). The original provisions requiring the government to specify in budget papers the steps to reach targets, where the targets will be met, and reasons if not met, have all been removed. This significantly reduces the compliance burden on government while mandating the core accountability mechanism of having to consider, or take into account, the committee recommendations.

It simplifies and clarifies. The new provision is brief, clear, and consistent with the existing legislative frameworks for parliamentary executive relationships. It clearly removes any doubt as to whether the committee can direct the executive - it clearly cannot. 

The sixth amendment creates consistency with the first amendment, it ensures language throughout the clause reflects the committee's advisory rather than directive role and the amendment applies the provision enabling the Auditor-General to report on whether targets were met, again emphasising that these recommend target, not imposed requirements. The seventh amendment is a belts and braces provision that removes any possible ambiguity about the committee's powers. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=26.8_D=3.4_C=0.70]  It states explicitly, 'the committee is not required to comply [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.5_D=12.6_C=0.83]  with the committee recommendations, the government is not required to take any action to comply with recommendations' and this applies to the Treasurer, the government and statutory authorities.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=44.0_D=15.1_C=0.73] Mr President, I have included this out of an abundance of constitutional caution, with a shift from establish to recommend and the use of have regard to language should make the advisory nature clear. This provision removes any possible argument the committee has a directive power.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=60.1_D=20.8_C=0.83] The effect this amendment would have is to ensure the government retains complete discretion. It must consider recommendations to have regard to obligation and must respond to committee reports under clause 10(5), but it may lawfully choose not to adopt any recommendation and that choice would not be challenged as unlawful. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=81.7_D=8.6_C=0.76]  The provision protects both the committee from claims that exceed its powers and the government from claims its brief statutory obligations by not following recommendations.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=91.0_D=16.2_C=0.72] The eighth amendment's key purpose is to enable an earlier possible review by allowing assessment after one parliamentary term for four years rather than two terms - eight years - while still creating it outer limit. The review must commence by year 8. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=107.7_D=10.2_C=0.76]  This allows the flexibility and accountability of the committee itself. Parliament can assess effectiveness sooner if needed, but it must do by year 8 at the latest.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=118.7_D=15.8_C=0.83] Given this is a new oversight mechanism, an earlier review option allows Parliament to assess and adjust if the committee approves ineffective or if unintended consequences did emerge. However, maintaining a minimum four-year period ensures the committee has sufficient time to establish its operations [Bookmark: Phr10_O=134.7_D=2.2_C=0.78]  and demonstrate its value before being reviewed. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=138.2_D=29.5_C=0.77]  The ninth amendment clarifies that if a review commenced before the 8 years, it must be completed within 12 months, as expected when the bill was presented.

Mr President, these amendments represent careful listening to concerns raised, thoughtful refinement of the bill's language and a commitment to ensuring the committee operates with the highest constitutional standards. They transform potential weaknesses into strengths. They address legitimate concerns while preserving the bill's core purpose.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=168.3_D=29.2_C=0.79] They clarify ambiguities by maintaining robust oversight mechanisms. The bill, if it is amended and proceeds through the process, provides for the committee that can advise on fiscal strategy through evidence-based recommendations, scrutinised fiscal management and continuous oversight, inform Parliament and parliamentary and public debate through transparent reporting and respects executive discretion while demanding executive accountability. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=198.4_D=5.1_C=0.83]  This is precisely the balance of a Westminster parliamentary system, and what it should the balance it should strike.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=204.7_D=15.2_C=0.83] In summary, in conclusion, Mr President, we are long past the point where good intentions are enough. Every recent Treasury report has made it clear the scale of our challenge, expenditure growth consistently outpacing revenue, forward Estimates that are increasingly unreliable [Bookmark: Phr15_O=221.2_D=7.7_C=0.80] , health demand pressures acknowledged but underfunded, and billions in debt piling up without a credible repayment plan. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=229.5_D=29.8_C=0.82]  The truth is this. Without structural repair, without discipline and without sustained parliamentary oversight, the problem is likely to deepen. Tasmanians deserve more slogans and pathways to surplus. They deserve evidence that decisions are being tested against clear fiscal principles, whether independent scrutiny applied not just at election time, but at all times.

The bill is not about one party or one government. It is about parliament creating an enduring mechanism to [Bookmark: Phr17_O=259.4_D=29.9_C=0.79]  governments of any persuasion to account. Minority government, majority government, coalition or otherwise, the discipline of a standing committee where this mandate will endure beyond the life of a single parliament. Tasmanians know instinctively that our budget challenges are serious. What they want from us is seriousness in response. This bill offers Parliament a way to step up and strengthen oversight work toward the budget repair.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=289.5_D=15.5_C=0.69] It is not the Parliament's job to do; it's the government's job to do it. It makes accountability continuous, transparent and unavoidable. I commend the bill to the House and urge members to support the second reading of the bill into the committee stage to enable the proposed amendments to be considered.

[3.55 p.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - I thank the member for Murchison for bringing this forward for consideration by the Council, and for her ongoing work to strengthen the accountability and transparency mechanisms of this place, for which she was acknowledged by the Better Politics Foundation as the 2025 inductee to the Politicians Hall of Fame.

There can be no doubt the state's finances are in unprecedentedly dire circumstances. The often-cited 2025 post election financial outlook report revised the forward estimates of net debt for 2028 from $10 billion to $13 billion. They're just staggering, mind-numbing numbers. I feel the need to lay on the record, just for contrast, that when the former Premier Will Hodgman came to office in 2014, net debt left by the Labour-Greens government was $226 million, and now we're staring down the barrel of $13 billion in net debt by 2028.

The post-election financial outlook noted recent state budgets and forward estimates have been defined by increasing deficits and debt, and said 'this rate of growth in debt is not sustainable, and the size of the problem will only increase if not addressed. Immediate and sustained action is needed.' (tbc 3.57)

Reflecting this state of affairs, in November 2024 both Standard & Poors and Moodys revised their respective outlook on the state's rating from 'stable' to 'negative watch'. Our financial situation is parlous. I don't know if any members saw the story in The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald last week. It is an embarrassment to the state that we're being talked about in the national media as the financial basket case. I will read a couple of excerpts from this article titled 'Tasmania's Fall Would Hit All of Us'. (tbc 3.57)

Now there's chatter about which of the states and territories are in financial trouble, and there's one at the top of that list: Tasmania. The utter mess of the state's finances was laid bare by the Tasmanian Treasury just ahead of the July state election. Annual interest costs, for instance, are expected to climb by 202 per cent between the just completed financial year and 2027-28. General government net debt is on track to rise from $4.2 billion to $13 billion. Spending has been growing at close to 10 per cent a year since the turn of the decade. Revenues have not matched the spending explosion. 

Treasury officials used their pre-election outlook report, the PEFO, over which politicians have no control, to paint a picture bleaker than the Tasmanian wilderness in the depths of winter.

'The state budget has a structural problem. Expenses significantly driven by health demand and costs are growing at a faster rate than the state's current sources of revenue', it said. 'This structural imbalance has developed over a number of years. Recent state budgets and forward estimates have been defined by increasing deficits and debt. As a state, we're spending more than we earn, and the gap is growing.'

It goes on to speculate that -


If Tasmania found it was unable to pay its creditors, it's difficult to imagine a federal government allowing the state to default.

That's how serious it is. We're being talked about as a state that's gone broke that could need a massive federal bailout.

Abetz and his team should be bracing for the state's credit rating to be downgraded no matter what comes out next week, that is, the state budget. Standard & Poors Global, for instance, put Tasmania on a negative outlook when it last examined the state's finances in November. It has gone pear-shaped since then. Tasmania's credit rating is likely likely to be cut to AA or even lower, with a knock-on effect to the interest rates on its future borrowings. That should be a warning bell to every state and territory - bar Western Australia, which continues to be funnelled cash by the rest of Australia due to the increasingly disastrous GST deal - that budget management still matters.

Sitting suspended from 4.00 p.m. to 4.30 p.m.


BUDGET ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE BILL 2025 (No. 57)

Second Reading
 
Continued from above.

Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - Mr President, I will finish reading from this article in The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald, where the state of our finances has received national media attention: 

Abetz used his first speech to the Tasmanian parliament last year to argue: 

The current generation should not leave debts for future generations because we're too selfish to tighten our belts.

That rhetorical flourish is about to be utterly tested. If he fails, watch out for a state Premier wandering around with empty suitcases looking for cash. Potential changes to our credit rating tell us there's now a much higher likelihood that the credit rating will be lowered over the short-to-medium term. Both rating agencies cited the state's weakening fiscal performance and growing debt burden as key factors in assigning the negative outlook to the state. 

The budget outlook is exacerbated by the government's reckless fiscal policy, careless as it is about wasting public money on follies such as the Macquarie Point Stadium. The lower-case strategy for revenue outlined by this government has consistently been - if the Council will forgive some paraphrasing - that by investing in business and the economy, our economy will grow and our revenue base will grow. That, indeed, is a philosophy that's been echoed by the Tasmanian Labor Party in recent months. It's a failed trickle-down approach by any other name. [TBC]

What the Greens are particularly concerned about is that the state is heading for a period of deep stadium austerity, should the stadium order be approved, where political choices will be made that deprive Tasmanians of the public health, housing, education, services that they need, making it much harder for us to respond to galloping, runaway climate change. That's the risk that we face as a state, should the stadium be approved: intergenerational stadium austerity. It's notable that in the PEFO, the Treasury states:

Economic growth correlates weakly with general government sector revenue growth in Tasmania. Accordingly, this structural problem will not be resolved through future economic growth. Explicit policy choices are required. [TBC]

But there's no real evidence of any will on this government's part to make those specific and difficult policy choices. In fact, I was reminded this morning of a statement, again from the Treasurer, but this time in his inaugural speech, where he said, 'All government priorities will need to be set based on genuine necessity'. It begs the question: what does our Treasurer regard as necessary in terms of funding? Of course, we won't have long to wait to find out what the Treasurer's definition of necessity is and whether it will adequately cover the public service needs of the people of Tasmania. 

The PEFO also makes it clear that growing the revenue base will be a necessary step to get the budget under control. This government has explicitly refused new taxes, charges, levies; it is foolhardy at best to rule out sensible and equitable revenue-raising measures. 

In essence, the government has a number of overt positions on budget management that are directly inconsistent with very clear Treasury advice that leaves no wriggle room. So in this context, the case for scrutiny of the budget situation is oxygen clear. That's why [Bookmark: Phr2_O=28.7_D=0.9_C=0.92]  this bill does have merit to establish a budget oversight committee; but we are concerned that it hasn't been properly consulted or fully consulted, that it's potentially [Bookmark: Phr4_O=45.4_D=28.9_C=0.85]  duplicative with the role of the Public Accounts Committee and other scrutiny mechanisms that we have across the two Houses of parliament that we potentially could strengthen. 

When the situation is so chronic, and the strategy of the government is effectively exposed as one that will lead to further deterioration of the budget, parliament can and should look at mechanisms to scrutinise and influence [Bookmark: Phr5_O=74.5_D=24.8_C=0.85]  the government over their handling of the state's finances. The Public Accounts Committee is one such mechanism. Expanding membership of that committee is one step that would help to improve scrutiny, and I hope that members favourably consider the bill that will come before this place on expanding the PAC. 

I've watched many PAC hearings. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=100.1_D=5.0_C=0.87]  Any concern that honourable members of this place, or the other place [Bookmark: Phr7_O=105.5_D=24.9_C=0.83] , have about PAC being politicised by expanding it, I hope would be realistic given that currently the membership of PAC has two government members, two Labor members, two very capable Independents from this place, but it's not representative of the parliament. It's not representative of the people of Tasmania, and often it devolves [Bookmark: Phr8_O=131.3_D=4.1_C=0.91]  into highly-partisan political sparring between [Bookmark: Phr9_O=135.8_D=15.4_C=0.73]  the two alleged parties of government in this place: political point scoring.

Ms Forrest - Through you, Mr President, that's an unfair representation of the PAC.

Ms O'CONNOR - That's my perception.

Ms Forrest - As the Chair, I shut down party politics as quick as a flash. You can check with the members here.

Ms O'CONNOR -  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=152.7_D=5.7_C=0.72] I'm passing on to you my observations over a long period of time of watching the way the PAC works [Bookmark: Phr11_O=158.9_D=15.1_C=0.87] . You as Chair, honourable member for Murchison, do your best, but it has not infrequently devolved into highly-partisan politics between the two parties of government [Bookmark: Phr12_O=174.5_D=15.3_C=0.85] . In fact, we saw it just the other day when the Coordinator-General came before the Public Accounts Committee. To his credit, Mr Winter was pressing Mr Perry about his very bold assertions [Bookmark: Phr13_O=190.9_D=26.4_C=0.78]  and output assessment of the stadium's benefit. Then the Liberal member of PAC couldn't help himself. Mr Winter's questions were completely legitimate to drill into a state servant's bold assertions that fly in the face of the Tasmanian Planning Commission's report. The Liberal government member of the PAC got a bit prissy [Bookmark: Phr15_O=220.1_D=4.0_C=0.77] , if you like, about the fact that Mr Winter was asking difficult questions [Bookmark: Phr16_O=224.9_D=17.0_C=0.82]  and tried to make a political point out of it. 

The PAC, as it stands now, plays an incredibly important function, but it is not representative of this parliament or of the Tasmanian community.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=243.1_D=29.6_C=0.84] The bill in front of us today establishes a new legislative joint standing committee on budget accountability and oversight. It would be tasked with looking at matters relating to the budget, fiscal sustainability, public finances and fiscal strategy. This proposed committee does have significant overlap with the existing Public Accounts Committee, which the Public Accounts Committee Act 1970 gives the broad mandate of examining, 'the management, administration or use of public sector finances'.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=274.0_D=24.9_C=0.84] In contrast, the proposed budget accountability and oversight committee's purpose is to evaluate, 'the management of public sector finances'. Very similar, really, not much contrast at all. While the purpose is effectively identical to the PAC, there are some specific powers that would be provided for under this bill which are not available to the PAC. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=299.7_D=4.6_C=0.85]  The budget accountability and oversight committee would have the power to set its own budget targets and then the Treasurer is expected to take those targets into account and make a statement against each of them in the budget. The budget papers would also have to justify why targets made by the committee were not met. The Auditor-General may also, under this bill, make commentary about whether or not the government is meeting those targets in any of their reports. Whether or not it's appropriate that the Auditor-General examine the work of a government committee and explore whether or not the government has sufficiently responded to the recommendations of that committee is a relevant question, and perhaps the member for Murchison could address that in the second reading reply, but the Auditor-General already has a very significant work plan. Whether or not it's something the Auditor-General would want to undertake, I am uncertain.

Essentially, the committee would have the power to develop an alternative fiscal strategy the government is obliged to take note of and report on. The experts who presented at a briefing last week when I was on leave, but also provided papers to members expressing their concerns, have raised some issues about their concern this would be something of an overreach for a committee of parliament and Professor Richard Herr's brief paper says:[tbc 4.41]

Maintaining parliamentary supremacy is an ongoing struggle. Governments constantly seek to circumvent obligations to parliament with claims, inter alia, of executive privilege, public interest immunity, and commercial in confidence. The bill under review is clearly intended as a full-throated pushback against such efforts to pull a cloak of executive invisibility over the government's use of the public money appropriated by the parliament. However, and this is a qualification that pains me, as generally I find parliaments do not push back enough, the unamended bill seems to me to be an attempt at overreach of parliamentary authority. The constitutional position is that the crown in its executive function asks the parliament to raise supply to pay the cost of the government doing its job. Requests are also made to undertakings deemed to be in the public interest. Parliamentary supremacy does not extend to micro-managing the administration of government. A government collectively and individually is responsible for what it does not do, does not, what in doing, what Parliament tells it to do.

Professor Herr acknowledges the amendments go some way towards mitigating his concerns, but still, he is not, in broad terms, supportive of the bill. He finally offers some helpful observations to promote, in a practical way, some of the intentions of the bill:[tbc 4.43]

The resources and capacity of the parliamentary research service should be enhanced substantially. Parliamentarians and parliamentary committees need more independent in-house research assistants to better challenge the enormous resources available to the government through bureaucracy and other sources.

Restating a point I have made for more than two decades - the Legislative Council should cease cooperating unnecessarily with the government through participating in private briefings. It's important that decisions made as a consequence of such briefings be fully discussed openly on the floor of the Chamber. Courts and the public need to be aware of the rationale behind the laws and regulations made and sustained in parliament.

The Legislative Council should insist on a clearer senate-style separation of government and parliament. Private members should not act as leader for government business where a minister is available, nor should private members answer questions on behalf of the government.

Professor Gabrielle Appleby also raises concerns about this bill and her advice to Council is to have a look at the accountability and transparency mechanisms that you already have in place and strengthen them where you need to. She says:[tbc]

Consider reference to a committee of an inquiry that looks more holistically at the operation of budget and expenditure scrutiny in the state across the budget cycle, including consideration of the roles, membership functions, and effectiveness of the Public Accounts Committee, the role resourcing and effectiveness of the Auditor-General, the effectiveness of scrutiny of budget through estimates processes; the effectiveness of the multi-partisan budget consultation panel [which I'm a bit sceptical about to be honest] the proposed establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office and the proposal of the Budget Accountability and Oversight Committee as an holistic examination of the mechanisms that we have here.

It is also worth noting that having two separate strategies within the budget is potentially confusing, particularly when one of them is a strategy the government may or may not support. Indeed, the government may choose to not let the strategy form part of the lens through which they produce a budget at all.

I note a number of amendments have been proposed that would be significantly mitigating these concerns. It is always a good thing when a member, government or otherwise, takes into account feedback, and takes steps to amend their bill to reflect that feedback. This is something that the government itself seems to be learning, although quite slowly. I commend the member for Murchison for this, and acknowledge the amendment considerably addresses these concerns. 

However, it does again raise the question of how the committee is materially distinct from the Public Accounts Committee. It is fair to acknowledge the specific outlined function of producing an alternative fiscal strategy is something that PAC doesn't currently do, even if it's theoretically could. It is still a valid question, regardless of whether or not the amendments passed, why would you not just add to the existing functions of PAC, rather than establish a whole new committee with a near-identical purview in order to fulfil this function?

It is also relevant to consider that part of the context of contemporary discussions about the budget relate to specific contemporary circumstances. While long-term scrutiny is certainly important, there is a question in the Greens' view over whether we need mechanisms to deal with the current and looming crisis to persist indefinitely as it would, should this bill be passed. For example, we currently have a sessional committee on the recommendations of the final report of the commission of inquiry. The importance of this committee and its work are in no way diminished by the fact that it's a sessional committee and not a legislated standing committee.

There's also the question of efficiency, which is particularly relevant in a budget crisis. When resources are limited, it is not particularly efficient to create a new committee with ostensibly the same purpose as an existing one for the purpose of performing only one specific function that could be performed by an existing committee.

I am curious to know - and it's a question we've asked in briefings, but on the record, an answer would be good - if there's any example of another jurisdiction that has this mechanism, this legislated standing budget oversight and accountability kind of mechanism of the parliament in place. As far as we know, I don't think there is, but  happy to stand corrected.

In summary, Mr President, the Greens support the intent and some of the ideas behind this bill and would be more than happy to support the establishment of an inquiry into budget repair and related matters, as well as any form of investigation into reforms to Parliament's budget scrutiny processes. However, we remain unconvinced that the proposal in front of the Council today is precisely the right way to proceed.

On that basis, as well as the input from experts in legal and parliamentary processes and accountability and transparency mechanisms, we made the decision - with heavy hearts, to be honest, because we are big on accountability and transparency - to not support this bill.

[4.49 p.m.]
Mr HISCUTT (Montgomery) - Mr President, I will speak to one particular area which concerns me. I rise today to speak on the bill before us and begin by thanking the member for her contributions in bringing this matter to the House.

I acknowledge the efforts and intent behind the legislation. Let me be clear from the outset I have no issue with the intent of the bill, in fact, I support the principle of prudent financial responsibility. It is a value that should underpin all levels of government decision-making and believe we all share a commitment to ensuring public funds are managed wisely.

However, my concern lies not with the what, but with the who. Specifically, I take issue with whose responsibility it is to enact and enforce fiscal discipline. In our system of government, fiscal responsibility is the role of the executive. It is the executive government that is charged with making financial decisions and it is they who must be held accountable for those decisions. The bill, while well intentioned, potentially blurs the lines between the responsibilities of the executive and the legislature. 

Even though the provisions within the bill are framed as recommendations, we must be cautious. Recommendations, once released, can create expectations, and expectations that they will be followed regardless of their advisory nature. Herein lies the risk: if the recommendations are followed and the outcome is unfavourable, be it financial mismanagement or unintended consequences, the public may not have a clear avenue to hold those responsible to account. A member of our House, for example, who may have contributed to these recommendations is not subject to the same electoral scrutiny as the executive government. This undermines the principle of democratic accountability.

By contrast, when the executive government makes a decision, they do so with the knowledge that they will be judged by the public at the next election. That is the cornerstone of our democratic system. The role of this parliament is to hold the executive to account, not to assume its responsibilities. We have mechanisms at our disposal to scrutinise government decisions: committees, inquiries, estimate hearings, and on this very floor of the Chamber. These are powerful tools that we must use, and we must use them effectively, rather than encroach upon the executive's domain. That said, while I hold reservations about the bill, should it proceed, I would be willing to put myself forward to participate in its implementation. 

I believe that if we are to engage in this process, we must do so responsibly and with a clear understanding of our role. In conclusion, I urge members to not just consider the intent of the bill, but the implications it may have on the balance of power and accountability within our system. Let us tread carefully and ensure that in our pursuit of good governance, we do not inadvertently weaken the very structures that uphold it. It is not my intention to support the bill.

[4.52 p.m.]
Mr EDMUNDS (Pembroke) - Mr President, this is going to sound a bit familiar: Labor supports the intent of this bill to restore trust and accountability in the way Tasmania manages its public finances; however, as well intentioned as it is, Labor cannot support the bill. We do appreciate the work that the honourable member for Murchison has put into developing this proposal and putting it forward for consideration. We agree that the way Tasmania's finances are managed by this government is abhorrent. 

We have a rapidly deteriorating budget position and net debt is increasing to previously unimaginable levels, with the cost of servicing the debt stripping away funding from essential services that many Tasmanians rely on. The government continues to kick the can down the road and there has never been a pathway to surplus. The financial mismanagement over successive budgets by this Liberal government amounts to a breach of the fiduciary duty to Tasmanians.

There are many existing mechanisms designed to assist MPs to achieve what this committee seeks to achieve: the Public Accounts Committee could undertake this role after the state budget is handed down every year. It already has the mandate and capacity to scrutinise the government's financial decisions and performance, and strengthening its work would be a more effective and practical approach, perhaps, than creating a new committee.

While this proposal is well intentioned to assist members in their work, the establishing of such a committee risks becoming a shield for the government, rather than a tool for accountability. We've seen this pattern before, when scrutiny is shifted to a committee, allowing the government to deflect from its responsibility. The danger is that instead of strengthening accountability, you could create another layer that the government can hide behind.

The harsh reality is that this government has shown time after time that no matter the advice, no matter the scrutiny, no matter the concerns raised, it does whatever it wants with Tasmania's finances with flagrant disregard for what is in the best interests of Tasmanians. Budgets are developed based on the advice of the apolitical public service, in particular the Department of Treasury and Finance, who I am sure share our frustration with the dire state of Tasmania's finances.

The most recent 'Pre-Election Financial Outlook Report' made this clear, noting, and I will paraphrase, that the budget reflects decisions made by the government taking into account Treasury's advice. To me, that is code for you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. Let's not forget independent reviews by the likes of economist Saul Eslake, containing advice and recommendations that have been dismissed and ignored by this government. 

At the end of the day, budget decisions are made by the executive government at the Cabinet table. It is the Cabinet that decides what is funded and what is not. Ultimately, approval of the budget rests with the government of the day, and this government has shown disregard for its responsibility to manage the budget in the best interest of Tasmanians [Bookmark: Phr2_O=16.3_D=24.6_C=0.83] . That is the fundamental problem. Tasmania's budget challenges are serious, and I strongly agree that Tasmanians deserve more than meaningless and misleading statements about a non-existent pathway to surplus; but I'm not sure we need another committee. We need a government that can deliver. 

I look forward to continuing to work with and engage with the member for Murchison to hold the government to account for the way it manages the state's finances [Bookmark: Phr3_O=41.7_D=3.8_C=0.73] . I will make a brief comment about the Public Accounts Committee. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=46.0_D=24.6_C=0.78]  This House elects three members, regardless of their political stripes or persuasions, based on their relationships with the people in this House, so I don't like being chirped for my political party membership, when I've been elected by this House, not my party.

Ms O'Connor - It is not about you. It is about the committee.

Mr PRESIDENT - Order. 

Mr EDMUNDS - This House elected me to be on the PAC, and I look forward to serving on the PAC for as long as it continues selecting me to do that.

[4.57 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - [Bookmark: Phr5_O=72.5_D=2.2_C=0.44]  Mr President. The government acknowledges that corrective action is required to improve the state's financial position. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=92.6_D=28.7_C=0.80]  The government has recognised the significant financial impact the response of the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the state's finances, as well as the response to the commission of inquiry. 

The combined impact of the government's responses amounts to over $3 billion, and it's no secret that compound growth in expenditure over the past five years is 8.7 per cent, against the compound growth in revenue [Bookmark: Phr8_O=122.0_D=1.5_C=0.76]  of 6.9 per cen [Bookmark: Phr9_O=124.4_D=24.0_C=0.84] t. Not unlike the mainland states and territories, the state has been facing significant pressures meeting health demand, with expenditure on health services increasing by around 11 per cent per annum. Significant underfunding by the Australian Government has significantly short-changed Tasmania's consumers and the government is continuing to fight for its fair share.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=149.0_D=4.7_C=0.72] The Budget Accountability and Oversight Committee Bill of 2025 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=154.1_D=14.6_C=0.82]  seeks to establish a joint Parliamentary Standing Committee tasked with evaluating and overseeing the management of the public sector finances, including fiscal sustainability, efficiency and accountability. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=172.5_D=15.5_C=0.86]  At first glance, these are admirable aims. Transparency and accountability are at the heart of good government. However, while the intent of this bill is understandable, its mechanisms raise both governance and practical concerns.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=188.6_D=11.8_C=0.89] The bill introduces powers and functions that not only overlap with existing accountability institutions but also blur the separation of powers between parliament and the executive. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=201.5_D=18.9_C=0.86]  That is not how our Westminster system is designed to work. Under Tasmania's Westminster system, the executive is accountable to parliament for financial management decisions. Ministers sit in the parliament precisely so they can be questioned and held to account [Bookmark: Phr15_O=221.4_D=7.5_C=0.80] ; however, parliament's role is one of scrutiny and oversight and not one of co-decision-making in this context.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=230.5_D=24.9_C=0.89] It holds the government to account after decisions are made, not alongside the executive in the process of making them. By empowering parliament to set fiscal targets and requiring the government to adopt or report against them, this bill distorts that accountability chain. It creates a situation where parliament sets the rules and then examines the government for following them. That undermines clear lines of responsibility and is inconsistent with the doctrine of responsible government 

Even with the amendments proposed by the member for Murchison - and we thank the honourable member for those - these lines, while softened, are still blurred. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=255.9_D=17.2_C=0.84]  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=273.8_D=24.4_C=0.84]  The bill empowers the committee to establish its own fiscal targets, to review and scrutinise budget papers and to recommend measures to achieve those targets. The bill, as drafted, requires the Treasurer to take those targets into account when preparing the state budget, and the targets, as well as commentary, must be reported in the annual budget papers.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=299.8_D=4.0_C=0.71] The bill requires the Treasurer to take the targets into account [Bookmark: Phr20_O=304.1_D=0.9_C=0.90]  as part of the annual budget process and provide commentary regarding whether the targets were or were not adopted, and if targets are adopted, how the government is addressing those targets.

Even if the government does not agree to comply with the target, the Treasurer still must include the targets of the committee in the budget papers. Setting fiscal targets is the role of the executive to advise and the government to adopt. While the amendments proposed by the member for Murchison attempt to dilute this overreach of the parliament into the responsibilities of executive government, this is still overreach.

Regardless of whether the government adopts the targets of the committee, the parliament is still interposing its targets in a government document. In practice, this means parliament would either be directing or recommending fiscal policy, something reserved for the executive. This is not parliamentary scrutiny, this is parliamentary control, and it also undermines our executive.

It would mean that the executive is no longer solely responsible for its fiscal decisions, and the parliament would no longer be independent in its examination of decisions, actions or performance of the government.

The parliament exists to provide fair, objective and impartial oversight, especially where accountability, due process or public trust are at stake. The bill represents a fundamental shift in Tasmania's governance model. 

The bill would also have significant practical implications. Firstly, the bill is premised on the achievement of fiscal sustainability. However, the definition in the bill of fiscal sustainability refers to the achievement of the principles prescribed in the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007. One assumes that it is the achievement of the committee's targets that would demonstrate this, or is the achievement of the targets in the government's fiscal strategy.

It would also likely to be the Department of Treasury and Finance who would be required to provide extensive data, analysis and modelling to support the committee's inquiries. This would divert resources away from core statutory functions, including preparing the state budget and managing fiscal repair. It would also mean that the executive could be taking on two roles: one in advising the government, and the other advising the committee.

Moreover, without executive resourcing, the committee would have to fund its own experts and consultants, drawing on the public account. That means taxpayers would effectively fund a parallel fiscal authority, duplicating the work of Treasury, the Auditor-General and the Public Accounts Committee. That is neither efficient nor responsible.

The member for Murchison states that the committee will provide an ongoing standing framework for scrutiny, unlike the annual cycle of budgets, revised estimates reports and other financial reports. The reporting requirements contained in the Financial Management Act 2016 are comprehensive and regular, and when combined with the process of parliament provide an already significant framework for scrutiny of Tasmania's financial position.

The member also acknowledged that every recent Treasury report has made plain the scale of our challenge. This would suggest there is already transparency regarding the state of Tasmania's public finances. There are existing robust mechanisms for fiscal scrutiny: the Public Accounts Committee, which examines public finances and efficiency; the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007, which requires the government to publish a fiscal strategy and report on it annually; and the Auditor-General, who provides independent assurance and reports directly to this parliament. Together, these mechanisms provide transparency without blurring the line between oversight and administration. 

This bill adds complexity, not accountability. In addition, while the member for Murchison has stated that the bill will not cut across other committees, including the Public Accounts Committee, stating that the work of this committee will complement the work of other committees does not mean the work will not be duplicated. In fact, it is likely to add an additional layer of complexity when the work of various committees overlaps. 

If the intent of this bill is to strengthen accountability and transparency, then instead of creating another committee, the member for Murchison could more appropriately propose that the government amend the Public Accounts Committee Act 1970 to require the government to respond to that committee's reports. The member for Murchison also suggests that the reporting against targets set by the committee will assist to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of expenditure undertaken by government agencies. It's unclear how reporting against targets set by the committee would translate into more efficient or effective expenditure decisions of agencies.

If this is, in fact, what the member intends, this would arguably be very burdensome on agencies. In fact, if the government is required to report against a set of principles such as those in the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007, it is unclear how this would be practically achieved. Principles are not reported on, rather they inform the setting of targets. This reinforces that the committee will need to set targets and it will be executive government that will be reporting on both these targets and those in the fiscal strategy of the government of the day. The reach of the committee, insofar as what it can establish targets for, is extremely broad, and extends to setting targets for improvements in the efficiency of expenditure of government agencies or statutory authorities. It's unclear how the committee would inform itself to set a target of efficiency in expenditure decisions of accountable authorities and how this would be measured and reported.

The government is committed to improving the state's finances, with the Treasurer having recently established the Multi-partisan Budget Consultation Panel. Meetings to date have been focused on education and involvement in fiscal matters, with the intention being that the panel will be involved in working with the government as it develops a new fiscal strategy to be included in the 2026-27 Budget. As with many policies developed by government, it is intended that consultation on a new fiscal strategy would involve consultation not only with just the Multi-partisan Budget Consultation Panel but with members of this place.

The government will be working on fiscal improvement strategies in the lead-up to the 2026-27 Budget, focusing on productivity, digital transformation and examination of the provision of government services. 

The government knows that the Public Accounts Committee is currently undertaking an inquiry into the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office for the state. The terms of reference include to inquire into and report on the establishment of a Tasmanian Parliamentary Budget Office, including 

the benefits, opportunity and challenges; 
most appropriate model; 
resourcing required; 
role of the Tasmanian Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Accounts; and
key legislative provisions needed to establish a Tasmanian Parliamentary Budget Office.

The Budget Accountability and Oversight Committee Bill 2025 is well intentioned, but crosses over into the role of executive government. By empowering parliament to set fiscal targets and binding the executive to consider, adopt and report on them, this approach undermines the separation of powers through an overreach of parliamentary authority. Even requiring the government to consider or report against parliamentary fiscal targets blurs the lines of responsible governance and weakens the fundamental principles of the Westminster system. It duplicates existing accountability bodies, adds administrative burden and risks politicising fiscal management. Tasmania's parliament already has strong tools for scrutiny. What must be protected is the balance between scrutiny and governance, between holding the executive to account and respecting its constitutional role to govern.

Mr President, for these reasons, the Government cannot support the bill in its current form.

[5.09 p.m.]
Ms THOMAS (Elwick) - Mr President, I rise to speak in support of the Budget Accountability and Oversight Committee Bill 2025. I start by commending the member for Murchison for bringing this bill to us in this place and for her hard work over many years to understand and scrutinise the budget. That's certainly not an easy task. I acknowledge the member for Hobart, acknowledge the efforts of the member for Murchison as well. I rise to speak in support of the bill and, quite frankly, I don't often find myself feeling frustrated and struggling to understand other views in this place, because I do my absolute best to understand other perspectives and respect them, but I've been rather astounded at the shock and concern about this bill. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=28.2_D=2.2_C=0.74]  My initial reactions on reading it were, 'what a great idea [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.1_D=19.6_C=0.79] ' and 'thank God someone is doing something about this'. I have been quite taken aback to learn that members appear to be so concerned about a potential overreach of power that may contravene the Westminster principles when I'm really concerned about saving our bacon.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=52.0_D=10.5_C=0.82] Whilst I do my best to genuinely understand and respect others' views, I must admit I am struggling in this instance. I found that response from the government quite hard to listen to [Bookmark: Phr5_O=64.3_D=15.9_C=0.75] . I acknowledge that those who take a contrary view to mine.

Ms Rattray - Was it the way I said it or just what I said?

Ms THOMAS - It wasn't the way you said it at all, Leader. No disrespect to you at all. I appreciate and respect that that is the position of the government. They, similarly, may not like mine [Bookmark: Phr6_O=80.8_D=29.7_C=0.83] , and that's totally okay, because that's the wonderful privilege we have of living in a democracy. 

The way I see it, the problem we're trying to solve here is that our state is in a financial crisis - a budget situation worse than it's ever been, according to all reports, quickly heading into $13 billion of debt, with no meaningful reform planned to stop us falling off the cliff. The solution proposed through this bill is to establish a committee to take a good, hard look at the financial situation and make recommend [Bookmark: Phr7_O=110.6_D=30.0_C=0.77] ations to the government as to what might help fix it. I started wondering if I'd been reading a different bill to the government on hearing that reply. 

Alternatively, we can simply continue to lament how bad it is and whinge and moan about the irresponsibility of the government - and I'm sure we will all be doing some of that next week when we deliver budget replies. We can spend hours scrutinising expenditure and Estimates hearings for no real meaningful outcomes and most certainly no improvements to the financial situations of [Bookmark: Phr8_O=140.8_D=0.7_C=0.62]  Tasmanians.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=142.7_D=25.0_C=0.84] I'm not sure about my fellow honourable members, but I simply cannot sit back and watch the executive government plunge our state further into financial crisis and do nothing more than call them out on it because I'm worried that suggesting a way to fix it risks stepping on their toes. What damage could stepping on their toes possibly do anyway? I'm struggling to recognise any seriously adverse consequences here.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=168.2_D=5.4_C=0.70] In the briefings over the last week, I've heard suggestions that the parliament is here to review the actions of the executive government [Bookmark: Phr11_O=174.2_D=1.8_C=0.96] , not to tell it what to do. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=176.5_D=18.1_C=0.84]  Well, while I respect that as a different take to it from mine, it does come as surprising news to me. I hear members calling out the government, calling on the government to do things all the time, through motions and in the media. I hear members making suggestions on behalf of the people we represent all the time. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=195.0_D=8.6_C=0.86]  Committees make recommendations all the time. I cannot see how this bill is proposing something fundamentally different. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=205.4_D=13.1_C=0.79]  

Recommendations to the government are all this bill provides for - a mechanism to have a good, hard look at the state's financial position and make recommendations to the government on financial targets, monitoring budget processes and repair, and fiscal sustainability.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=219.3_D=12.6_C=0.85] Personally, I feel it is our role as a parliament to collectively, as members wanting to protect Tasmania's best interests, to be doing anything we possibly can to get the government to recognise the need for serious intervention and meaningful reform. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=233.0_D=7.7_C=0.90]  In fact, when I first read the bill I thought, 'Oh, I wonder if it could be amended to strengthen what the government has to do with the recommendations.'

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=241.3_D=19.0_C=0.80] Making recommendations binding on the government would most certainly be an overreach. Obviously now I realise that, but that's where my mind was initially going. In the briefing we had with Prof  Richard Herr last week on this bill, he shared his view that parliamentary supremacy does not extend to micromanaging the administration of the government, as the member for Hobart also touched on. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=261.4_D=11.9_C=0.84]  He said government is responsible to the people for what it does, not for what the parliament tells it to do. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and we most certainly are in desperate times.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=274.0_D=6.7_C=0.91] Let's ponder for a minute what could possibly happen if the parliament doesn't intervene here and the state goes broke. Who will be intervening then? [Bookmark: Phr20_O=281.5_D=23.5_C=0.80]  If we don't do it, we may end up needing a bailout by the feds, and then it could be the federal government that may be micromanaging the administration of the Tasmanian government, and we will have missed our chance. It will be the feds who are calling the shots, recommending targets and processes and repair measures, not the people Tasmanians democratically elected to represent them. So far as I see it, that's the risk we're accepting if we do not support this bill. This risk has been identified across the country already, with senior economist Shane Wright reporting on Tasmania's economy 'going south' in The Sydney Morning Herald last week, on 30 October. Mr Wright stated: [tbc]

If Tasmania fails to get its debt and interest levels under control, the federal government will be left carrying the can for the Apple Isle taxpayers.

Personally, I want to be able to say to the people who I represent that I, hand-on-heart, did everything I possibly could to understand and formulate ideas on how to repair our dire budget situation. I recognised it was in dire straits and supported and contributed to every opportunity I had to make it better.

As Prof Herr also said in the briefing last week:[tbc]

Historically, the representative function of the parliament set in train the evolution of parliament's duty to ensure that the people's interests are represented and protected. That has resulted today in the parliament being the supreme organ of governance in this Westminster system of democracy. 

I can't, in good conscience, face a struggling taxpayer and tell them that I didn't support the establishment of a Budget Accountability and Oversight Committee because it risked overstepping Westminster conventions in maybe being an overreach of parliament authority. They would say, 'Give me a spell.' 

I don't believe it does risk being an overreach anyway, especially not now it's been weakened through amendments to recommend targets, rather than establish targets. In fact, no-one has specifically articulated a specific Westminster principle or convention that this proposed committee overreaches. I've only heard broad generalisation that it blurs the separation of powers or the doctrine of responsible government. How do I explain to a taxpayer what that means?

The Leader for the Government's reply notes that this would represent a significant shift in Tasmania's governance model. Well, things have shifted in Tasmania, and we are in a minority government. Anyway, what are the consequences if it is an overreach? Do we have to explain ourselves and apologise to the King? The sky is not going to fall in if we pass this bill to establish a Budget Repair Committee today - and we should, for Tasmanians.

Again, touching on the government's response to the bill, I note honourable members received a letter from the Treasurer, Mr Abetz, pointing out a number of concerns that he, as Treasurer, has about the bill. What I say in response is that I see the aim being to help here, not to hinder. If the government was going to oppose the establishment of the committee and write to honourable members, perhaps it would've been helpful in that letter to outline what the executive government is actually doing to repair the budget, because I have absolutely no idea. Tasmanians have no idea, and that is simply not right. 

The only specific initiative the Treasurer referred to in that letter was that the government has established a multi-partisan budget consultation panel; a strategy that is already providing the opportunity for non-government members of the House of Assembly to engage strategically on long-term fiscal strategy, budget repair initiatives and the development of the Tasmanian Budget. This panel was not established through the parliament, it does not have representatives from both Houses of the parliament, it does not hold public hearings, it does not publish minutes or outcomes of its meetings, and it has no requirement to report to the parliament or to the people of Tasmania. I wonder what budget repair initiatives they have engaged on in the first four meetings so far.

In response to claims that the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) can fulfil the purpose of this bill, I agree - yes, it could. However, the way I see it, the PAC's role is typically reactive, scrutinising spending decisions. The proposed committee's role is proactive, and proactivity is something that we simply don't see enough of, because we simply don't make time for it. Governments certainly don't seem to have, or make, time for it. 

We operate in the urgent, immediate sphere way too much, out of necessity. Having a separate committee clearly sets the tone of proactivity, enabling members and secretariat to be in that particular headspace when the committee is convened. Establishing a specific committee under statute demonstrates to Tasmanians that we, as a parliament, are dead serious about this. It's the parliament making a statement that it is taking the financial position of our state seriously and doing everything in its power to help address it for the people that we are so privileged to represent and serve in this place. It's bringing elected members, and the people we represent, on the journey to budget repair. It's about transparency. It will improve financial literacy, both for us as members and for the public.

It's interesting to hear some members say that they would be happy for PAC to do an inquiry to look into the things being proposed as the committee's role and function in this bill. Then I asked how and why is this then not unconstitutional? I'm not sure.

As for the government's comments that the budget is already the subject of significant scrutiny through the normal legislative processes and the budget estimates hearings, well, how effective are these processes? What do you think Tasmanians think about the time and resources put into budget Estimates week? For what outcomes, other than finding out some more information about specific initiatives, opportunities for non-government members to seek some 'gotcha' moments, and ministers trying to avoid these at all costs?

I spoke about this in my budget reply speech in June. During my contribution, I noted the government has had plenty of time to stand up and listen to calls to reform the budget. The member for Murchison has been conveying significant concern for some time, as have other members of parliament. There have been solutions suggested; there have been goodwill offers of wanting to work together to find solutions, as Tasmanians rightly expect us to do. However, the government instead ploughs on, seemingly forgetting they are leading in minority, that they don't have a mandate, and that they actually do need to work together with all other members to deliver for Tasmanians.

The government is ignoring the richness and diversity of our collective intelligence in this and the other place, what the 50 of us could achieve working together. If the government isn't going to put mechanisms in place to do this, the parliament can. In my view, it should. In my budget reply speech, I spoke of my experience in budget development at Glenorchy City Council. I shared that our budget process involved a series of workshops beginning in around October and going through until June. Everyone came together to discuss priorities and ideas, informed by the advice of each department of council. We also engage with the community about its priorities to help inform our decision making. I am not saying this was perfect and I'm not saying a committee of parliament should take on the role of the executive. That is not what I'm saying. I want to be clear about that. I know councils are different and operate under a different system.

As I asked back in June, why can't we look at doing something similar that brings members on the journey to understanding here? If 50 members is too unwieldy, what about a budget committee? I asked this back in June in my budget reply, and here we are.

We know the current process is not working. It is not satisfactory to most non-government members. It doesn't effectively serve the people we represent. We are rushed in delivering a budget reply and the next week government administration committees and staff will spend hundreds of hours collectively scrutinising the budget line by line, questioning ministers for some answers to explain things that aren't clear in the numbers or the commentary presented. This budget Estimates process consumes enormous amounts of resources both during the week in our time, ministers' time, and the time of departmental staff and advisers who support ministers. It consumes significant resources of government department staff and advisers who spend thousands of hours collectively of taxpayer money in preparing huge folders full of information for budget Estimates. All for what? As I've said, certainly no material change. It's too late. Why not have these conversations before the budget is finalised?

Let's do things differently. I would have liked to see a new budget development process set out in this bill, but I can see again now that most likely this would have been definitely seen as an overreach. I'm satisfied that the bill refers to the development of the budget and scrutiny processes as being one of the matters for the committee to examine and report on.

Let's imagine what would happen if the same expectations of local government applied to state government when it comes to governance and financial management. Perhaps, that's something this proposed committee could gather evidence on, because if a council was managing its budget and major projects like the government has been, and if there was as much dysfunction around the table as there has been, it would most likely be put into administration pending a board of inquiry review. This is what happened at Glenorchy City Council back in 2016-2017 and although costly, it was necessary for a reset. As a result, there was not only an election to bring in a new council, but also a series of ministerial directions setting out over 50 actions the council was to undertake to restore good governance. This became the council's priority and it worked. Glenorchy City Council became referred to as the 'turnaround council', but it likely wouldn't have happened without the guidance and direction of that board of inquiry.

In winding up, in this new world for Tasmania, at least, of minority government, we have to get comfortable with doing things differently, challenge convention, and try new ways of working if we are to achieve the best outcomes for the people we are so privileged to represent. I predict many of us will be lamenting the state of the budget as we do budget replies next week. This is our chance, not just to complain about it and heap blame on the government, but to help do something meaningful about it. I won't miss it.

We're in survival mode in Tasmania. We need this committee. The government doesn't realise it or want to admit it, but it needs this committee and most importantly, Tasmanians need and deserve this committee. I support the bill.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=14.2_D=11.2_C=0.67] [5.25 p.m.]
Ms WEBB (Nelson) -  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=26.9_D=10.0_C=0.76] Mr President, [Bookmark: Phr5_O=43.7_D=9.8_C=0.81]  I rise to speak on the Budget Accountability and Oversight Committee Bill brought to us by the member for Murchison as a private member's bill to this place, and I'm really pleased to do so. It's been an interesting [Bookmark: Phr6_O=55.3_D=1.3_C=0.89]  debate thus far [Bookmark: Phr7_O=58.2_D=22.4_C=0.77]  and I  acknowledge the member for Murchison's long-standing interest in and passion and advocacy on fiscal policy and budgetary decision making in this state. The member for Murchison has been a leading voice calling for greater accountability in these areas and for much needed reforms in our approaches in order to address  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=82.1_D=20.6_C=0.81] what can only be an understatement, calling it a highly concerning trajectory of our state's financial situation we face at the moment. Certainly, we all recognise that, and understand and acknowledge that is the impetus behind bringing this bill to this place for our consideration.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=103.8_D=27.2_C=0.82] The member's second reading speech certainly points to that current backdrop. A backdrop of a deteriorating budget position and that unwillingness in the face of successive warnings from Treasury, from independent economic experts and existing parliamentary committees and by the current government to engage in meaningful and evidence based long term budget repair. That's a position of refusal on the part of the government essentially that we've seen [Bookmark: Phr10_O=131.6_D=1.8_C=0.69]  there for quite some time and continu [Bookmark: Phr11_O=133.7_D=3.6_C=0.75] ing and I imagine we might see it continuing yet again on Thursday.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=137.9_D=16.6_C=0.82] That is the circumstance that many of us here share an intense frustration and significant alarm over, and certainly understandable the member for Murchison and many others in the community and Parliament are turning their mind to addressing that situation [Bookmark: Phr13_O=156.0_D=12.9_C=0.85] . Given that, I understand the motivation for seeking to improve the oversight of public sector finances and to improve the transparency, the fiscal discipline and the accountability around decision making in that area.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=169.9_D=29.7_C=0.84] As my colleagues in this place will be well aware, I'm a passionate advocate too, for greater accountability and transparency in our governance broadly and for fully utilising the powers and mechanisms of Parliament to deliver on more accountability of executive government for the Tasmanian community, who've put us in this place as their representatives to do that. I will always be one of the first in this place to be keenly interested in progressing appropriate parliamentary mechanisms, focused on accountability and improving our ability a [Bookmark: Phr15_O=199.8_D=24.0_C=0.86] s a parliament to undertake our role.

In this instance I don't believe that this bill to establish a new joint standing committee is warranted, nor has it been conceived of and developed in a way that is rigorous, evidence informed and expert advised, which is what we should expect when it's a matter of such seriousness as a legislated new Joint Standing Committee.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=225.0_D=27.8_C=0.84] Overall, my take on the bill is it hasn't been comprehensively developed or considered. We can see that by the fact we've been having, in briefings, very active conversations about potential issues with the bill. We can see that the member who's bringing the bill has a range of amendments to make if the bill goes to the committee stage. We can see it in the fact we still have a lot of questions on clarity about what's in the bill and what it means [Bookmark: Phr17_O=253.2_D=4.6_C=0.89]  and what it means in relation to other parliamentary mechanisms we have in this place. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=260.1_D=10.8_C=0.87]  That bill will inevitably duplicate areas of responsibility and the work of other parliamentary mechanisms without sufficiently clearly defining the relationships and interactions therein.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=272.3_D=28.7_C=0.80] The committee activity established in this bill goes beyond the constitutional role of Parliament and moves into policy making which risks then blurring the lines of electoral responsibility and accountability. By that it may leave the government of the day less accountable to the voters of Tasmania by removing full executive government responsibility for fiscal decision making.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=303.0_D=2.0_C=0.70] The member for Murchison says there's a gap in the current assessment and reporting framework that we have in this place, and if that is the case, it certainly needs to be more clearly identified, scoped and understood what that gap or gaps may be. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=20.2_D=30.0_C=0.87]  If there is a gap or gaps, we need to start by asking ourselves what those gaps are, what is the nature of them? What is the extent of them? If they are in fact there, we need to ask ourselves are they due to structural missing pieces, or are they to do with underuse or misuse of current mechanisms that we have available to us in this place? 

For example, a structural problem may be that none of our current mechanisms have the remit to do [Bookmark: Phr4_O=50.3_D=27.1_C=0.80]  the work that's been identified as the gap; or that the remit is there, but the powers and scopes, for example, are insufficient in the current mechanisms we have, in which case we could have a conversation about updating or strengthening or improving those mechanisms. It may be that under the current structures and mechanisms we have, there is remit and powers there to do the work specified for this new committee that's been identified as a gap, but for one reason or another [Bookmark: Phr5_O=78.2_D=3.8_C=0.64] , our existing system and mechanisms are not fully undertaking that work.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=83.3_D=14.5_C=0.85] Those reasons for not doing that might be lack of time, lack of resources or capacity, or perhaps competing priorities for the members in, say, other committees or other circumstances. I have a policy development background, so my approach is we need to scope out what this is all about. We need to understand the network of mechanisms we have. We need to map those out, we need to understand [Bookmark: Phr8_O=113.8_D=13.4_C=0.86]  what specific problems we are trying to solve and where those problems lie, and then we need to look at options for addressing those identified issues within the identified and mapped-out structure that we have.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=128.3_D=15.9_C=0.85] A more methodical identification and scoping of the perceived gap in assessment and reporting would have also given us the opportunity to examine the constitutional appropriateness of any new or additional roles for parliament that might be put forward as a solution. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=145.0_D=16.9_C=0.87]  That's a question that warrants and deserves expert consideration and comprehensive examination. It's no small thing for us to be debating this here, and to have significant questions over the parliamentary appropriateness of the role described in this bill.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=162.6_D=17.8_C=0.86] While members might be feeling a sense of frustration and urgency about the fiscal situation that our state is in - and we absolutely share that frustration - it's not a reason to rush in and do something that has huge parliamentary question marks hanging over it.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=184.1_D=29.0_C=0.86] I don't believe that we should be charging ahead to put in a new joint standing committee under statute without having properly identified the problem we're trying to fix, without having sought advice and input from all relevant stakeholders and experts, and without having examined various options that might be available to us to address the issues we've identified. 

If we'd gone through a normal development and consultation process on this matter, a key question for us would have been: if there's an identified area of work [Bookmark: Phr13_O=213.2_D=18.2_C=0.86]  that's missing, that should be done by parliament, can it be done within in our existing, well-tested structures? Our answer to that may well have been yes, but those existing mechanisms may need to be strengthened or have additional resourcing allocated to it, or some other measure of improvement.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=232.3_D=14.4_C=0.87] In a briefing from Dr Richard Herr, we heard an axiom he shared with us from the criminal justice space: we may not need new laws all the time to address an issue; we might just need better enforcement of the laws we have. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=246.9_D=24.6_C=0.82]  In this case, I think that is quite pertinent. We may not need new parliamentary mechanisms, just better use of the ones we had. In fact, if we had gone through a process - and I will note right here, while I'm pointing to the fact that we haven't yet gone through such a process, of course it's available to us absolutely to go through the sort of process that I'm describing here as the right way to go about this work.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=272.3_D=2.4_C=0.69] Had we gone through that process [Bookmark: Phr17_O=276.2_D=21.7_C=0.91] , we may have been able to not just potentially identify ways to do the work of the gaps that the member for Murchison believes are there, but also we may have had the opportunity to bring further improvements to our existing structures and mechanisms. That would have been the value also, the starting point being identifying the issue,  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=298.6_D=6.4_C=0.88] looking at how it fits within the existing options and mechanisms we have, and then asking ourselves what solutions do we need to look to. The second reading speech says the purpose of this Budget Accountability and Oversight committee is clear, it says this:

… to give parliament - and through parliament. the people of Tasmania - a stronger, continuous mechanism to evaluate government financial management, test fiscal sustainability strategies, and recommend measures to repair and protect the state's finances and improve outcomes for Tasmanians.

Unlike the annual cycle of budgets, Revised Estimates Reports and other financial reports, this committee [Bookmark: Phr3_O=37.7_D=2.8_C=0.76]  will provide an ongoing, standing framework for scrutiny.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=41.3_D=29.8_C=0.85] We have an existing ongoing, standing framework for scrutiny in our parliament. That's exactly what parliament is. In the ecosystem of that framework of scrutiny, we have an Auditor-General, we have the Public Accounts Committee, we have budget Estimates, and we have GBE Estimates. We have the ability to form select or sessional committees of inquiry on specific matters; we also have questions in parliament from all members in this place and the other place. We have the power to call for documents from the parliament.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=72.1_D=4.9_C=0.72] Now, if you had asked me if all these mechanisms function perfectly [Bookmark: Phr6_O=77.5_D=1.9_C=0.91] , my answer would be a resounding no. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=80.5_D=18.0_C=0.85]  We should always be asking ourselves how they may be improved and strengthened, and in fact, going about that in a structured way via, say, a committee of inquiry into strengthening those mechanisms and and improving our scrutiny capabilities would be ideal. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=99.5_D=29.5_C=0.86]  The current context, and this debate that we're having on this bill, should absolutely prompt us to examine them formally to determine opportunities to improve and strengthen them. 

This is work that we should be doing collectively as a parliament, and it's fine for there to be members who take leadership on these issues, and we all respect and appreciate expertise brought in that space. But it is not up to a member to determine what is the right way forward on something as consequential as this. The development of it should be a task that we've entered into in a formal [Bookmark: Phr9_O=129.2_D=25.6_C=0.80] , parliamentary way. 

If you were to ask me, across all those mechanisms I mentioned, does the parliament fully and comprehensively scrutinise all government's financial policy, management and outcomes, my answer would certainly be no, we don't do that work in a fully comprehensive way. That, of course, is due to a range of things, including but not limited to: the small size of our parliament and the limitations on available members [Bookmark: Phr10_O=155.2_D=3.4_C=0.72] ; our resourcing and capacity limitations within our parliament [Bookmark: Phr11_O=159.2_D=14.0_C=0.89] ; competing priorities - we have a lot of different parliamentary work to do here, so we're always balancing priorities against each other. 

All that means that yes, if we were to think of ideally, how much scrutiny should there be of government, we will always fall short of that ideal.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=174.1_D=3.2_C=0.84] I don't know that adding another committee [Bookmark: Phr13_O=178.1_D=16.6_C=0.89]  with significant overlap with existing committees and mechanisms into that context solves any of those challenges I just mentioned. In fact, I wonder if it has the potential to add to them, because of spreading us more thinly or adding in other competing priorities.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=196.2_D=13.4_C=0.85] I'm not saying what we do now is fine and we should just sit back and keep letting this situation happen, because we know that the situation is only growing exponentially in urgency for our state. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=210.4_D=24.4_C=0.85]  What we should be doing is thinking to ourselves and acting on how can we as a parliament strengthen our parliament's power and the mechanisms that it has available to it to hold the government more effectively to account. Just adding another committee, particularly with significant overlap, does not guarantee us a better outcome than we're getting now in terms of scrutiny. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=235.4_D=17.8_C=0.84]  Unless the issues that I have about the membership of this committee that are not clear in the bill are addressed, it certainly potentially adds a problem into the mix for us by spreading people even more thinly, or inappropriately doubling up.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=254.9_D=24.7_C=0.85] The member for Murchison has spoken about the functions of the committee being enabling the development of measures that are outcomes focused, that can promote the improvement, the efficiency and effectiveness of expenditure of public money, that would enable agencies and statutory authorities to report data to show a clear link between expenditure of money and outcomes achieved as a result of that expenditure [Bookmark: Phr18_O=280.6_D=4.2_C=0.66] , with the establishment of such measures, that can be reported against and subsequently audited, potentially.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=286.2_D=5.2_C=0.93] I believe all of that is available to us right now in the mechanisms we have. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=292.9_D=2.7_C=0.90]  We do not need to form another committee to do that. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=296.4_D=8.3_C=0.81]  If it is something beyond what we already have the power to do, in terms of scrutiny, then it takes us into policy development activity. Taking away a directive imperative from this committee, which is what the member's amendments seek to soften, so that it doesn't look like this committee is directing the government, doesn't actually address the fact the activity described potentially goes into policy development activity, because it sets up competing policy against the executive government's policy. That is not the role of this parliament.

There is a very fine distinction to be made here between recommendations of other committees, where we make recommendations on policy matters to government, which government is then at liberty to consider. As this is about recommendations and targets and measures being set and recommended or proposed there is a distinction. We make a distinction on fiscal matters in other ways in this parliament. For example, any legislation coming to this place from government on a policy-related matter we are at liberty to amend in this place if the Chamber sees fit, except budget bills. We already make a distinction between what we can decide in this place in relation to government policy, on policy matters that aren't fiscal, compared to what we can do on policy matters that sit in that fiscal space.

There is a difference between the fact that other committees of inquiry or standing committees on other matters may do inquiries and may provide recommendations in their reports to government.  This proposed committee, the fact it can make recommendations on fiscal targets, is different. We make a distinction on fiscal matters when it comes to responsibility. The reason we do that is really clear. There's a very distinct constitutional separation between the role of executive government on fiscal matters and the role of parliament. I will talk about it a bit more in a minute. It is a separation we need to be more aware of. One of the things that makes this place and a Westminster parliament very different from other circumstances of governance, like local government. It is very different to that.

Mr President, I note the second reading speech about the bill states the committee is formed in order to complement the PAC, but there's no description about what that means in practise and how it's complementary. There's certainly a very strong perception of overlap. It's inescapable that it looks like overlap here. When you look at the functions of the PAC, you can see mirrored many of the things that are mentioned in this bill as functions of the proposed committee. It is simply unavoidable to see that.

Without a process by which we've arrived at this bill - a rigorous, comprehensive consideration of what was the problem we're trying to solve, what are the best options, this one is the one we'll progress with because it's the best indicated option, without that rationale sitting behind this bill, the questions we have about overlap cannot be adequately answered by the member for Murchison. She can assert they are complementary. She can assert there's not overlap and there's a distinction between the roles, but on the facts of it so far and from what's been provided to us, we can't make that assessment for ourselves with confidence. Simply, the work has not been put in behind it in an accountable, visible way for us to go by.

I acknowledge the member for Murchison's experience on the PAC and the fact that she's the current chair of the PAC, so has a deep understanding of the PAC - the other thing important to say the reality is that the PAC has a certain way that it's working here in practise, and that's fine, but it also has what it is is empowered to do under statute in the act that governs it. Just because the PAC in practise now may do certain things or not do certain things, doesn't mean that the PAC is not able to do other things it isn't currently doing, or doesn't have a history of doing.

If we want certain scrutiny activities in the fiscal area to be done, just because the PAC hasn't done it, or isn't currently doing it, doesn't mean it can't do it. If there's an imperative that work is undertaken by the PAC, then that's a conversation the PAC should be having, or that this place should be having with the PAC, because we are at liberty to make refer matters to it.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=7.3_D=7.1_C=0.90] The other thing I find problematic is the relationship with the Auditor-General and the proposed committee. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=15.5_D=17.8_C=0.82]  When we're considering mechanisms that we have available to hold the executive government to account, we have the Auditor-General, a key independent part of that picture under statute, that is literally an independent office completely separate to government, established in order largely to inform parliament [Bookmark: Phr4_O=33.9_D=1.5_C=0.84]  in our scrutiny of government [Bookmark: Phr5_O=36.5_D=4.0_C=0.83]  through an independent, expert mechanism.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=42.0_D=17.1_C=0.78] We would want to be clear on the relationship of a proposed committee like this and the Auditor-General. The PAC and the Auditor-General have a well-defined relationship and that's true in other jurisdictions too. Everybody's might look a little bit different, but they're very clear and well defined. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=60.4_D=14.7_C=0.91]  The Auditor-General is referred to in this bill only in one respect, and it certainly doesn't describe fully what may need to be described in terms of a relationship with the committee, given the overlap in areas of interest [Bookmark: Phr8_O=75.2_D=2.6_C=0.74]  and activity on paper.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=79.3_D=29.4_C=0.81] We would want to have full clarity on how the two may interact with each other on those overlapping areas of responsibility. We would want to have clarity about how the relationship with the PAC and the Auditor-General and the relationship with the Auditor-General and this committee, for example, was to play out. How would potential issues be resolved? The problem is if the answer to that is there would be consultation, that's another thing I'm going to come to in a minute that relates t [Bookmark: Phr10_O=108.8_D=1.2_C=0.69] o membership of the committees.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=111.7_D=14.1_C=0.74] I don't believe we've been given sufficient information on this. It's just simply not available in the material we have with us and because there's not a body of work behind the development of this bill, we can't look to how it's been considered and addressed on the relationship with the Auditor-General.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=132.6_D=29.4_C=0.85] I note that in a briefing, the member for Murchison did tell us the Auditor-General was consulted on the aspect of the bill that mentions the Auditor-General. Unfortunately, because of a time issue, we haven't had a chance to talk to the Auditor-General about this bill. I believe the Auditor-General was consulted on the tabled bill. But now we have significant amendments to the bill which do change some key aspects in a way that may be meaningful in terms of the Auditor-General's  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=162.1_D=18.9_C=0.76] view of its role with this committee if it were to go ahead. Again, we haven't been given the information from the Auditor-General in terms of the consultation. We haven't been able to consult ourselves with the Auditor-General on it and we certainly don't know in relation to if the bill were amended as  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=182.5_D=3.5_C=0.76] sought by the member for Murchison, what the Auditor-General would think of that.
 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=191.3_D=1.4_C=0.72]  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=196.6_D=1.2_C=0.89]  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=200.1_D=29.4_C=0.83] 
It would have been particularly interesting if we had done, or if we were now to do a piece of work, to be asking ourselves about how we might better strengthen our fiscal scrutiny mechanisms within this parliament. If we were to do that work it would be fascinating to have on the record, as part of that formal inquiry thoughts from the Auditor-General on how that could happen and to see what the Auditor-General would put forward as suggestions for that and take that into account [Bookmark: Phr18_O=229.6_D=2.1_C=0.82]  and into the mix of [Bookmark: Phr19_O=232.8_D=2.7_C=0.79]  potential opportunities.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=237.9_D=12.0_C=0.84] I have mentioned already what we have here is the potential for there to be some confusion between [Bookmark: Phr21_O=250.4_D=3.1_C=0.82]  the proper role of executive government and the proper role of parliament. [Bookmark: Phr22_O=255.9_D=10.7_C=0.79]  Executive government having that policy development role and have been held accountable for decisions made in that area and parliament having a scrutiny and accountability role. [Bookmark: Phr23_O=267.0_D=2.2_C=0.81]  Now, that doesn't mean that parliament doesn't [Bookmark: Phr24_O=271.7_D=3.7_C=0.84]  call on the government to [Bookmark: Phr25_O=276.7_D=14.6_C=0.83]  go in different directions with policy. That's a a distinction that others were contemplating. Why would this committee be different from, for example, when I stand up in this place [Bookmark: Phr26_O=291.5_D=13.5_C=0.82]  and no doubt in my budget reply speech next week, I will be calling on the government to do to make different policy decisions than it's made in the budget presented on Thursday. I think we could probably all put safe money on that. I will be up here saying they should be making different policy decisions; I call on the government to do this different thing. Me doing that in this space is very different to a committee of the parliament making a recommendation, in the way that this committee would be making them on fiscal matters, which the government may then need to take into account in its budget.

I am here in this place to represent my community. I can call on the government to do the things that I think it should be doing. I will be held to account at the ballot box for the way I do that role. The government will be the ones held to account at the ballot box for the fiscal decisions they make.

Even with the gentler amendments that are suggested for the bill, if the government has to have regard to fiscal measures, accountabilities and targets that have been set by someone other than the government, that blurs the line of who's accountable for decisions made taking those into account. In fact, it gives the government an out, in a way. The government can say, 'We were trying to follow those suggestions/recommendations made on targets and on measures by that parliamentary committee. You can't hold us fully responsible for the fiscal direction that the state's now going in.' 

That's not right. When you are the executive government, you are the ones responsible and need to be held responsible for it. That's what scrutiny is all about. That's what the supremacy of parliament is all about. It's not about being a participant in executive government decision-making; it's being a scrutiniser of executive government decision-making. We can do other things like private members' bills and we can bring forward things ourselves, and we will ultimately be held to account for that, but we don't blur the line in who's being responsible for making the budgetary and fiscal decisions for the state.

I'm just skipping through, mindful of time. One of the things I've referenced a couple of times in my contribution, and I will address in brief now, involves concerns about membership of this committee as proposed in the bill. In my view, it's very problematic and it has been raised by others more expert than me. For example, it is problematic that there's no guarantee that the membership of this committee would be distinct and separate from the membership of the PAC. 

Indeed, if a stated purpose of this committee is to complement the work of the PAC, it's absolutely imperative that membership of the two committees is distinct from one another. Again, for the purposes of this parliament working as strongly and effectively as it as it could and should, we would expect there to be a difference in the membership of those two committees if they were both to exist, because if we're to add to the power and scope of our scrutiny, we want different eyes in both of those committees, different capacities and different viewpoints, different representation in that sense. Then we get double the breadth of scrutiny via different membership. There's nothing in this that says anything about that, and I believe that's problematic. 

It's even more problematic, because there is something in the bill that says there may be times that the two committees consult with one another on matters that may be overlapping in their work, or relevant in terms of their work. That's incredibly problematic if there's a doubling up of membership in those committees, particularly in leadership of those committees, because consultation can't happen between one person, or the same basic group of people from one committee to another.

That's not consultation, that's an opportunity for groupthink in what would become the two most powerful committees in the parliament. We already know that the PAC is regarded as the most powerful committee in the parliament. If you establish this committee, it would also be seen, potentially, as an incredibly powerful committee. You cannot have the same members or leadership in those two committees, particularly if, under legislation, they may be required to consult with one another.

To that end, while I don't support this bill, if it goes to the Committee stage, I also do not want to see it go through and potentially be supported at the end of Committee stage with the arrangements for membership as they are in this bill. I've prepared amendments to address those issues I've just spoken about if we get to that stage.

There's also nothing in the membership specified in the bill there that points to a need for there to be balanced representation in that committee that may come forward. This is an issue that's problematic. In a contemporary sense, it's much more normal, if there are committees formed, whether it's under legislation or under standing orders, to seek to ensure that there's some balance in representation, particularly from the lower house, from the other place. That's a very normal thing to do. It's appropriate that you ensure that significant parties that are represented in the lower house have an opportunity to be represented on key committees that may be joint committees of this place.

We have a different arrangement in this place in terms of how we arrange membership. In the lower house, where government is formed and where parties typically sit, and here in other committees and other jurisdictions, it's very normal for there to be specified representation across parties for membership of committees. That's to ensure, firstly and hopefully, that governments of the day can't take control of key committees. It's also to ensure that if a party has sufficient membership in the lower house to warrant party status, that they are not excluded from representation on key committees through that process being politicised and power being thrown around by major parties to exclude other parties from committees. 

It's a way of depoliticising, to specify particular balanced representation from the lower house into a committee such as this. That's not there at the moment. I don't have amendments to fix it. Again, I don't think this bill should go through, but I hope that if it does, there's another way that we can fix that down the track.

If the government brought us this piece of legislation, developed without proper process and with this many concerns hanging over it, with this lack of clarity hanging over so many aspects of it, with issues raised by independent experts with us in briefings, we would absolutely reject this bill if it was coming to us from the government. That's my view anyway. I believe, based on previous behaviour, members of this place would reject it. We would tell them to go back and do the work.

We would tell them that there needs to be a process to clarify and define the problem to be solved. We would tell them there needs to be broad consultation to consider a range of options to solve the clearly-identified problems. We would tell them that we need to see how the selection of the best indicated solution for our circumstances was arrived at. This isn't a committee being formed under standing orders for a trial period, for example. This is a committee being formed under statute. It's not something we should be rushing into. 

A four-year review does not cut it in terms of softening the significance of forming a joint standing committee under statute. We should not be rushing into it. We should not be making amendments to it on the fly in the committee stage, with serious questions hanging over it, and no guarantee that the amendments proposed will solve those questions. We have other options here, and I hope that what we do is take the really valuable opportunity we've had to focus our minds in this space. We should take that opportunity to say, 'What should we be doing now?' 

Let's not let this opportunity pass, or this impetus that we have to bring a significantly better level of scrutiny and accountability of the current government, which is failing so abysmally when it comes to our state budget and when it comes to fiscal policy. What can we do to strengthen the powers, the mechanisms, and the inclination of this parliament to hold that government to account? Any response that we arrive at has to be one we have full confidence in, which we can take forward with full credibility, and doesn't risk adding questionable decision-making or muddying the lines of responsibility and accountability. 

We need to ask ourselves, 'What is our option here?' Our option is that we should do a piece of work. We should go back and do the piece of work that wasn't behind this bill, but which could be done. Yes, it will take some time to do that piece of work, but we won't be treading over parliamentary boundaries by doing that. We will be doing it appropriately. We'll be doing it in a way that a parliament does its work, which is different to the way that a local government does its work. Elected members in local government are not equal to the elected members in a parliament. Those two roles are thoroughly different. In a local government setting, every elected member is the executive making the policy decisions there for their community. Here in this place, executive government makes decisions on policy, particularly fiscal policy, and the rest of us are here on behalf of the community in a Westminster parliamentary way to hold them to account for it. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.4_D=4.5_C=0.90] 

If we think they are failing year after year after year, which I think they are [Bookmark: Phr3_O=36.4_D=2.9_C=0.87] , it is on us to do our job better [Bookmark: Phr4_O=39.9_D=13.7_C=0.87] , to make the community aware of that failure more effectively so they don't vote them back in. The fact that they continue to be voted back in does reflect on our failure to adequately do our job. This bill won't fix that [Bookmark: Phr5_O=54.4_D=15.4_C=0.88] , but we should be asking ourselves how we can strengthen our ability to do that. We should be thinking to ourselves what are our opportunities here to make our parliament better? We do have them, and we should take that forward and [Bookmark: Phr6_O=71.9_D=17.4_C=0.87]  it's something that any member has available to them in terms of acting with leadership.

I appreciate the member for Murchison is often a leading voice in these spaces and often has a very clear line of sight over things we could and should be doing to hold the government to account. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=89.9_D=25.1_C=0.84]  This bill has been a misguided effort in that space, but I also respect the member for Murchison's ability to still be a leadership voice on these matters. I would hope that because, for example, she is the chair of the Public Accounts Committee, that there will be ways we can engage in an inquiry and a formal way forward to consider how we can meet the intent of this bill [Bookmark: Phr8_O=115.7_D=2.6_C=0.86]  but not pass this bill. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=120.3_D=1.2_C=0.94]  I won't be supporting it.

[6.02 p.m.]
Ms ARMITAGE (Launceston) - [Bookmark: Phr10_O=122.8_D=3.9_C=0.83]  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=130.7_D=7.1_C=0.75]  Madam Acting President, I will make a short contribution. Much has already been said. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=139.3_D=15.4_C=0.79]  I must admit, when I first started looking at this bill, I was in two minds: do I support it, or don't I support it? Listening to the contributions today has been interesting. I have to say I appreciated your contribution [Bookmark: Phr13_O=155.3_D=1.5_C=0.67] , as the member for a week.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=159.2_D=9.3_C=0.86] I accept the members that are opposed and as I said, I wasn't sure whether I would support the bill or not support the bill [Bookmark: Phr15_O=169.9_D=3.3_C=0.77] , but when I look at the fact sheet and the purpose of the bill:

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=173.9_D=4.6_C=0.85] establishes a parliamentary standing committee on budget, accountability and oversight.

I can't dispute [Bookmark: Phr19_O=195.0_D=1.2_C=0.88]  any of those. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=198.4_D=17.8_C=0.79]  I commend the member for Murchison. I could probably say, without any criticism, that she would be one of the most hardworking members in the parliament, not just this House. No, I think it's true, and credit where it's due. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=217.6_D=29.0_C=0.76]  

When I look at at the bill before us, I understand the concerns regarding the Public Accounts Committee. I did not have the briefing yesterday as it was a public holiday in Launceston, and I did have some other commitments I had to go to. That was all right, but there were things I had to go to. From my mind, and the many briefings I did attend, I understand there's a distinction, a different focus to the Public Accounts Committee, that the PAC [Bookmark: Phr22_O=246.8_D=15.5_C=0.87]  look at the money spent, not the front end. There are certainly differences, but what would be more important than improving our state fiscal situation. I don't think there's too much that's more important than that.

 [Bookmark: Phr23_O=266.4_D=3.4_C=0.89] I understand from the member for Murchison that it doesn't [Bookmark: Phr24_O=270.6_D=1.2_C=0.63]  conflict with the PAC. [Bookmark: Phr25_O=272.9_D=2.5_C=0.77]  The Public Accounts Committee looks at matters referred from the House [Bookmark: Phr26_O=278.5_D=2.4_C=0.93]  and this would look to the future [Bookmark: Phr27_O=281.4_D=4.6_C=0.90]  from its own motion. 

I am not going to go into any great [Bookmark: Phr28_O=289.4_D=9.8_C=0.86]  area or length as I don't think that's necessary. I always think it's far better to be short and concise. Say what you have to say. I will be supporting the bill. [Bookmark: Phr29_O=301.4_D=3.4_C=0.79] 

Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Madam Acting President, first time in the Chair. It's very good to see you up there.

I am going to make a few direct responses to some of the points that some members have raised, but I'm also going to make some comments that cover more broadly a number of matters that many members have raised. I am trying to address some of those specific matters raised by some members, but rest assured I will get to the other points a little later.

Pretty much everyone has acknowledged we've a real problem on our hands. The question we have here is: do we just accept the status quo, which clearly hasn't addressed the problem or changed the direction of the government, or do we do something additional to add to this that complements the PAC? It doesn't duplicate; it complements. I will come more to that in a moment.

I do take a little bit of umbrage of the fact the PAC has been partisan because of its membership. The incident referred to - I called it an 'incident' - referred to in the Public Accounts Committee, and Madam Acting President, you are a member, as is the member for Pembroke, I don't think you were at this meeting, which is just not a criticism, I understand the reasons you weren't there, but there was a bit of that argy bargy. I shut it down within about two minutes in a one-and-a-half to two-hour hearing.

Ms O'Connor - That's not the only incident.

Ms FORREST - I know it's not. That was the one that was referenced. We've had other episodes when the ministers themselves have tried to [inaudible - 6.06.55] and I shut them down, too, because it isn't the role of the PAC to be playing partisan politics. The PAC has a very important role in scrutinising the expenditure and the effectiveness of the expenditure, of state finances. 

While I'm Chair, if people try to play that game, they will be shut down. Sometimes it takes a couple of goes to make sure we do, but in the big scheme of things, out of the amount of time we spend in public-facing scrutiny, the amount of time that partisan politics is on display - because you can't stop it until it happens - is very, very minimal. You see far more of it on other committees. The minister for Infrastructure had his first fronting to the Public Accounts Committee recently, and I think he will attest there was no politics played in that hearing at all. He's not listening to me, so maybe he's not going to confirm or deny it.

In any event, we take our role very seriously on that committee. It is really important work. We shut that down, or I shut it down with support of other committee members, if and when it occurs. I just want to put that out there because it's a misrepresentation of how the PAC operates. Even in deliberations - and I'm not going to talk about deliberations of a committee -

Ms O'Connor - You misrepresented my observation.

Ms FORREST - If those sort of games are tried, they will be shut down equally quickly. We've seen that in this and other committees I've been on too.

I am going to touch on the points that were specific that I don't cover in more detail. I do say the government's contribution, made by the Leader for the government, contained what I would call a lot of complete nonsense. It absolutely misrepresented the reality and made a number of claims that were simply inaccurate, in my view. Even referring to the Charter Budget Responsibility Act, that is honoured in the breach far more than in the observance of it. To say that those sorts of things are mechanisms that are used, the government just ignores it.

Ms Webb - We should scrutinise that.

Ms FORREST - There does need to be a mechanism that can look into these matters and provide a way forward - or not provide a way forward, because that's up to the government to actually do the work. However, every committee in this parliament makes recommendations, and many of the recommendations are ignored, as is the government's right. We can hold them to account for ignoring those recommendations if we wish, but sometimes they adopt them, and I will come to that a bit more fully in a minute.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=11.6_D=26.4_C=0.67] The member for Elwick rightly said that we do tell the government what to do, by way of motions and all sorts of things. We call on the government do a whole manner of things, and they can adopt, or refuse. Like ministerial diaries - they've refused that a number of times, even though we had a motion in this House. Still ignored. We do often tell the government to do things. If you want to talk about the [Bookmark: Phr4_O=38.8_D=3.1_C=0.56]  conflation, if you like, with who's responsible if it goes bad [Bookmark: Phr5_O=42.4_D=27.8_C=0.81] ly or whatever, every member of this place, almost without exception, has made some sort of request or expressed a view of how the government should do it. We do it in our budget reply speeches, we do it in a whole range of other speeches, and contributions in committees to what we think or what we call on the government to do. Every committee recommendation calls on the government to do something, otherwise it's not a recommendation.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=72.8_D=11.4_C=0.84] This bill does not bind the government or the executive in any way. It does not. To say it does is misleading and inaccurate. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=85.6_D=13.8_C=0.79]  

I found some of the member for Nelson's comments quite contradictory, acknowledging the need for more and proper, rigorous scrutiny, but then not taking an opportunity here that provides just that. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=100.0_D=0.5_C=0.89]  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=101.7_D=20.9_C=0.84]  Talking about needing full clarity on every matter - we just dealt with a motion previously that was identified as not having the full clarity the committee may need. The committee to be established may need to contact the Tasmanian Planning Commission to get further clarity about what they will and won't cover. We accepted that, and that's a reasonable expectation. It's a reasonable thing to do.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=123.6_D=2.1_C=0.74] This is no different [Bookmark: Phr11_O=127.2_D=20.3_C=0.84] , and if it's a different mechanism - I'm just making that point, that we don't always have full clarity on everything. It's the high-level principle. There is no overreach into the executive. There is no compulsion for the government to do anything - which is a problem in itself - but that would be overreach, if we said they 'had' to  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=148.4_D=1.6_C=0.72] take certain actions.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=152.0_D=5.0_C=0.77] The membership is proposed, and I will touch briefly on this, because I don't believe we will get into Committee stage. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=158.4_D=5.4_C=0.62]  I would hope that we would, to prosecute these amendments, but that's the will of the House [Bookmark: Phr15_O=165.5_D=5.6_C=0.70] . The committee's structure is exactly the same as every other committee in the parliament [Bookmark: Phr16_O=172.1_D=14.9_C=0.74] : Public Accounts Committee, Subordinate Legislation Committee, Public Works Committee. The Integrity Committee has some little nuances. Ultimately, and I will speak a bit more about this  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=188.4_D=5.6_C=0.84] shortly, but - I think the member for Pembroke spoke about this, about how members are appointed to the committees.

Mr Edmunds - No.

Ms FORREST -  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=194.7_D=20.4_C=0.80] Someone did.

Mr Edmunds - Sorry, yes, I did.

Ms FORREST - We have what I think is a robust process in our House where people who are interested in the committee put their hands up. Then, if there are more members who nominate than there are positions, we have a ballot. How more democratic can you get? [Bookmark: Phr19_O=216.4_D=28.0_C=0.80]  I don't think we should be jumping at shadows and trying to create a whole separate structure for a parliamentary committee that would endure beyond this particular parliament if it does a good job.

I'm just going to make some overarching comments to wrap up. I thank members for their contribution on this bill and wish to address some of the other matters that have been raised broadly [Bookmark: Phr20_O=244.8_D=2.0_C=0.48]  during the speeches, and also some raised in the briefings to this bill.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=250.5_D=10.9_C=0.73] Some have suggested this bill represents an overreach into executive function. Some have claimed it duplicates the Public Accounts Committee, and some have argued it blurs accountability and electoral responsibility. [Bookmark: Phr23_O=262.2_D=13.7_C=0.77]  I intend to demonstrate why each of these concerns, while superficially plausible, fundamentally misunderstand both the scope of this bill - particularly if it's amended as per the amendments I provided last week [Bookmark: Phr24_O=276.4_D=22.6_C=0.81]  - and the proper constitutional role of parliament in our Westminster system. 

Let me just begin with first principles, because this is where we should focus. Parliament is supreme. One of our crucial roles, perhaps the most crucial role, is to hold the government and executive to account in an open and transparent manner. This is not an optional feature of our democracy - it is its very foundation. [Bookmark: Phr25_O=299.8_D=5.2_C=0.71]  When critics claim this bill oversteps into executive territory, they fundamentally misunderstand the constitutional relationship between the parliament and executive in the Westminster system. The executive derives its authority from the parliament. The executive holds power at the parliament's pleasure. The parliament has not just the right, but the duty to scrutinise how that power is exercised.

The question before us is not whether parliament may hold government accountable for fiscal management. Of course it may. The question is whether parliament should establish better mechanisms to discharge this duty effectively in light of unprecedented fiscal challenges.

Let me address immediately the most specific concern raised, that the bill somehow binds the executive or constrains its legitimate policy direction. The bill as proposed does not bind the government, and the amendments I propose, if we move into committee stage, absolutely clarify this. Where the original bill stated the committee may establish targets, the amendments change this to 'it may recommend targets'. 'May' recommend targets. This is no different to any other committee making recommendations to government to do a certain thing. In fact, during many committee deliberations I've been involved in, the committee has recognised that it has the power to recommend to government to take certain actions, whilst being cognisant that it is an action the government is responsible for.

It is absolutely clear the government is responsible for setting fiscal strategies, strategic actions and targets to achieve their fiscal strategies. A committee recommendation related to this area would need to be taken into account, but there is no compulsion at all to adopt any recommendation of the committee.

I hope we have a chance to consider the amendments in the committee stage to clarify that clause 6(1)(c) amendment means the committee may recommend targets in respect of public sector finances. 

Clause 6(3) would state: 'If the committee recommends a target under subsection (1)(c), the Treasurer is to have regard to that target when developing a budget to which the target applies.' The new subsection 6(5) removes any doubt about this matter, and it would read:

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section requires the Treasurer or the government or a statutory authority to comply with, or take any action to comply with, a recommendation made by the committee.

This is the language of parliamentary scrutiny, not executive direction. 'Have regard to' is precisely the same language used throughout our existing legislative framework, including the Financial Management Act 2016 itself, which requires the government to have regard to the principles of sound fiscal management. The government remains entirely free to accept, reject, or modify any recommendation. The government is required to consider any recommendation, which I hope occurs with every committee recommendation.

This is accountability, not constraint. This is transparency, not prescription. This is parliamentary oversight, not executive direction. 

Some have suggested this model is unprecedented or constitutionally novel. Nothing can be further from the truth. To outline why this is the case, I will go to the member for Hobart's question about other jurisdictions and other models that are similar. I refer to the Public Works Committee's function and powers. Section 16 of the Public Works Committee Act 1914 enables that committee to refuse to recommend that a public work proceed. Here is the crucial point: the government cannot proceed with that work without enabling legislation. That committee has enormous powers - they can knock back an approved government project and send it back to the government to say, 'If you really want do this, you're going to have to take it to the parliament.' They can't say, 'No, we disagree with that committee, we're going to do it anyway.' They can't. That's enormous power. No-one says that's unconstitutional. The Public Works Committee can effectively block infrastructure projects that involve hundreds of millions of dollars of public expenditure, unless parliament specifically overrides that decision through legislation.

Has anyone suggested the Public Works Committee is unconstitutional? Has anyone claimed it improperly constrains executive discretion? Of course not, because we recognise it is the legitimate parliamentary check on executive spending decisions. Yet critics of this bill, which merely requires government to have regard to recommendations, say it somehow crosses a constitutional line. This comparison I've just given reveals the weakness of this argument.

To consider another recent example: the gender and equality committee's recent inquiry into the Expungement of Historical Offences Bill 2025, and the referral from this House to consider matters related to compensation or redress for men convicted under those historic laws, who have had their historic criminal convictions expunged. The government, by way of proposed amendments in this House, offered $5000 in compensation regardless of the circumstances of the case. 

The committee, after due consideration, doing the work that the committee was tasked to do, recommended a scale from $15,000 for men who had been charged but not convicted, or $45,000 for men who had been charged and convicted but hadn't been subject to prison or aversion therapy or some sort of other inappropriate treatment, to $75,000 for men who had been charged, convicted and subject to imprisonment and other aversion therapy. This was a 15-fold increase from the government's initial position.

Now, such a recommendation was considered by the government. I had amendments drawn up in this place to proceed with that bill. It could have refused to accept that, especially as it did vary significantly from the government's stated policy position, which was initially, when first introduced, not to provide any compensation or redress. In this case, the government adopted the committee's recommendations in full, legislating and giving complete effect to those recommendations, as passed by the House of Assembly some weeks ago, and is now sitting on the table in our House for debate, possibly this week.

Did anyone claim the gender and equality committee overstepped its bounds by recommending a significant increase in expenditure of public funds? Did anyone suggest it improperly interfere with executive budget decisions? No, because we recognise the parliamentary committee's making recommendations on matters involving public expenditure is entirely normal, appropriate and constitutional. The government has the choice to adopt it or not. In this case, I commend them for adopting it.

If members are generally concerned about separation of powers and proper scrutiny of fiscal policy, let me direct their attention to the far more troubling arrangement: the Treasurer's budget review panel. This panel currently operates entirely behind closed doors. It has no legislative basis, its deliberations are not public, its recommendations are not disclosed. Members of the parliament on this panel, all from the House of Assembly, meet with the Treasurer to discuss and allegedly influence fiscal strategy without any public scrutiny, parliamentary privilege or an accountability framework. 

Talking to some of the members on that panel, they suggest they can't even test any of the things they're being told. That's hearsay because that was from a member of the of the panel. I was informed by a ministerial adviser that the Legislative Council members were excluded from this panel because we are a House of review. Think about the absurdity of that proposition. We are too much of a House of review to participate in reviewing the budget, but, somehow, we would be overstepping by establishing a formal, public accountable committee to do exactly that work.

I'm told this panel is currently working with the Treasurer on a new fiscal strategy and the leader herself alluded to that. One would expect this would include targets and strategic actions to achieve them. If that approach does not constitute encroachment on the role of executive, happening completely behind closed doors with no public or parliamentary scrutiny, how is it possible that the work of this committee, conducted in public, with the reports to parliament in full transparency, could offend the separation of powers? How could it? The hypocrisy is staggering. Critics oppose a transparent, accountable public committee while tolerating an opaque, unaccountable, secret process that actually does shape executive fiscal policy.

Some have suggested that we simply expand the public accounts committee mandate rather than create a new committee. This argument, while superficially appealing, reflects the fundamental misunderstanding of both PAC's role and this bill's purpose. Let me be clear: this is not a criticism of the Public Accounts Committee. I would be unlikely to criticise a committee I'm on. Would I, really? But the PAC does vital, excellent work within its established mandate. The question is whether that mandate, or indeed any committee's mandate, should be stretched to cover fundamentally different oversight functions. That front-end functions, as the member for Launceston alluded to, looking at the bigger picture - the money that's been spent or appropriated to be spent - but looking at how the whole budget is being managed and trying to look at how the decline in our budget situation can be assessed and considered.

The Public Accounts Committee Act is old, yes; so is the Public Works Committee Act, that's had a few amendments here and there along the way, but the Public Accounts Committee is focused more retrospectively, taking a reactive approach. If you look at the the inquiries on foot, of which there are seven at the moment - so just a bit on for the PAC - they're looking at decisions already made and expenditure already committed. It's a different approach.

If you wanted to expand it out - that was an option I considered, but I made a policy decision, which I'm entitled to do, to make a policy choice here that rather than try and expand the work of the PAC and give the PAC even more to do, with one committee secretary trying to handle all these inquiries we've got on foot, two of them references from the lower House - so you can't say no to those, you have to say yes, which is fine, I'm not not complaining about that, it's just the reality. There's seven inquiries on foot; this is a different approach.

It would be far better to have a separate committee looking at it, so you don't get that blurring and you don't get that confusion. It is a separate function. The PAC does have broad discretionary powers to examine any matter arising in connection to the public sector finances that the committee considers appropriate, but the discretionary power must be read in the context of the Act's overall structure and purpose, which is fundamentally retrospective accountability of funds already appropriated and/or spent.

This Budget Accountability and Oversight Committee is fundamentally different: its statutory purpose is to evaluate on an ongoing basis - as opposed to the annual budget scrutiny, for example - the management of public sector finances and assess strategies implemented to ensure fiscal sustainability, and to examine the application of the principles of sound fiscal management.

It can assess forward estimates or look at forward estimates - they're on public display, they will be on Thursday in the budget - and long-term sustainability in a proactive manner. Similarly, retrospective accountability (the Public Accounts Committee) and prospective sustainability oversight (this bill) are complementary functions, not duplicative; both are necessary. Neither can effectively substitute for the other without blurring the boundaries or roles.

The Public Accounts Committee Act makes no reference whatsoever to the principles of sound fiscal management. These principles are established in the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007. The fiscal principles include: providing for the future of the next generation of Tasmanians, preparing for unexpected events by building a robust financial position, ensuring transparency in accountability and fiscal objectives. I seemed to have dropped a couple off the list. There are a couple others, I seem to have not written them all down, but they're forward-focused, looking at future generations, looking to build a robust financial position. That's the role of this committee; not looking at what has been spent, has it been spent effectively, is it the right expenditure, what's gone wrong in this project now.

The Charter of Budget Responsibility requires the government's fiscal strategy to be based on these principles. The Financial Management Act requires agencies to act consistently with them as far as practicable, and requires government to have regard to them. It's very similar language to what's in this bill. Yet there is no parliamentary committee with an explicit mandate to hold government accountable for adherence to these principles. If you don't think those principles are important, I'm not sure why we put them in the act. I was here when we did it. They are critically important and they are future-focused.

This is an accountability gap that this bill fills. Some argue that the PAC could stretch its mandate to cover this; but if we are concerned about overreach and constitutional propriety, isn't it far more appropriate to establish a clear, explicit legislative mandate rather than to rely on legislation drafted for different purposes, that being the Public Accounts Committee Act?

The claim that this bill creates duplication reveals misunderstanding of what duplication actually means. Duplication occurs when two bodies perform the same function with the same tools for the same purpose. That's not what this bill creates. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=9.9_D=20.6_C=0.68]  The Public Accounts Committee and the Budget Accounting and Oversight Committee would have different focuses. The PAC looks at the past decisions already made and Budget Oversight Committee the future. They have different subject matters. The PAC is on expenditure propriety, whereas the Budget Accounting and Oversight Committee would look at fiscal sustainability. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.9_D=5.9_C=0.89]  I could go on, but there's a number of different matters that clearly outline the differences.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=38.7_D=29.1_C=0.72] The bill explicitly recognises the potential overlap because both committees will be looking at matters related to the finances of the state and the financial management and that's addressed in clause 8, and I will just read this.

If the Committee intends to perform a function, or exercise a power, in respect of a matter that is before the Public Accounts Committee, the Committee must first consult with the Public Accounts Committee before performing the function or exercising the power. (OK)

That's not duplication, that's cooperation and coordination. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=68.1_D=15.1_C=0.76]  It ensures both committees worked effectively together without creating a conflict and regardless of whether you have different people on the committees or there were some similar members, the committees as a whole deal with correspondence to a committee. If one committee writes to another [Bookmark: Phr6_O=83.5_D=1.8_C=0.93] , the whole committee considers it. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=86.3_D=4.3_C=0.81]  I've had a situation just recently on two committees I'm on where we've had to write to each other [Bookmark: Phr8_O=94.1_D=2.1_C=0.86] . We haven't had to but we chose to write to each other. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=100.1_D=21.4_C=0.68] 

Mr Gaffney - Did you get a timely response?

Ms FORREST - Still waiting on the response.

Moreover, clause 13 requires the community to consult with the PAC before agreeing from the terms of reference for the statute of review of the Act. This demonstrates the bill's commitment to cooperation, not competition.

All of this constitutional and structural discussion must be understood in the context of Tasmania's unprecedented financial crisis. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=122.2_D=12.0_C=0.80]  We're carrying levels of debt unprecedented in our state's history. Treasury reports consistently show expenditure growth outpacing revenue, forward estimates increasingly unreliable [Bookmark: Phr11_O=134.6_D=29.4_C=0.73] , health demand pressures acknowledged but underfunded. Billions in debt accumulating without credible repayment plans and bailouts for government businesses. A significant deterioration of the government's financial position has occurred since and despite the existence of The Public Accounts Committee, and it is not a criticism of the committee. The committee's doing the best job it can, but it demonstrates retrospective scrutiny alone is insufficient when we face such systemic structural fiscal challenges.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=164.6_D=28.5_C=0.74] Every mechanism available to the department already has been deployed to deal with this challenge. It is not getting any better. Budget debates, Estimates hearings, The Public Accounts Committee investigations, parliamentary questions, Auditor-General report, all those things have not seen the trajectory change. In fact, it's only got worse. Yet the fiscal position deteriorates. Why? Because none of these mechanisms provide a continuous forward-looking strategic oversight [Bookmark: Phr13_O=193.3_D=27.0_C=0.82]  of fiscal sustainability and that's what this bill is designed to fill that gap.

Budget debates are annual and political in many respects. Estimate hearings are limited in getting to the real underlying challenges. The Public Accounts Committee investigates specific matters after the fact and parliamentary questions receive prepared answers, Auditor-General's reports - which are valuable - focus primarily on past performance and compliance.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=221.6_D=14.9_C=0.79] We lack a specific mechanism designed to examine fiscal strategy continuously, to test its assumptions rigorously, to assess the sustainability independently, and to make evidence-based recommendations for improvement. That's what this bill creates.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=238.0_D=19.3_C=0.76] The member for Hobart - and maybe the member for Nelson as well - questioned whether other jurisdictions have similar parliamentary committees, particularly those who have the capacity to consider fiscal strategy and make recommendations related to those matters. There are a number of examples I will give [Bookmark: Phr16_O=258.6_D=8.9_C=0.77]  of parliamentary committees, not fiscal council, but parliamentary committees where these powers exist. New Zealand is one [Bookmark: Phr17_O=268.1_D=8.5_C=0.74] , close neighbours. Their Finance and Expenditure Committee looks at business related to economic and fiscal policy [Bookmark: Phr18_O=277.9_D=11.8_C=0.82] , taxation, revenue, banking and finance, superannuation, insurance, government expenditure and financial performance and public audit. Clearly, it has the committee to make recommendations in any of those areas. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=291.5_D=13.2_C=0.64]  I went to their committee website to read that information.

Then we have a copy of the UK Parliament POST from the UK Parliament. I will just read a few excerpts from this. They've looked at this matter. They're talking about devolved legislatures, talking about Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland. I am quoting from the report: [tbc 6.35]

For example, in Scotland, each select committee puts together a pre-budget report which is sent to the relevant ministers at least six weeks before the budget is published. They state how they think the Scottish government should spend its money over the next year. The Scottish government then responds to its reporting informing the committee as how their reports influence expending plans.

Clearly, a finger in the pie.

Further on, we're talking about the OECD best practices of parliaments in budgeting. Under the heading of fiscal responsibility:[tbc 6.36]

The legislature should have the opportunity to review and approve the national fiscal framework or major changes to the framework, in particular the fiscal rules and the medium-term budgetary framework. The legislature should examine long-term fiscal sustainability and analysis in order to debate risks faced by society in an open and informed manner and report them to the public.

Then if we go to Canada: [tbc 6.36]

The remit of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance includes undertaking pre-budget consultations with the public regarding recommendations to be made to the Minister for Finance for the next budget.

One could argue that that is overreach if they're telling the government how to spend the money. The Republic of Ireland:[tbc 6.36]

Part of the committee's remit is to consider the framework for parliamentary engagement through the budget cycle and make recommendations to -

I'm not sure how you pronounce - Dáil Éireann, the Lower House of the - I will say the Northern Ireland parliament because I can't pronounce the name of that. I apologise to the Irish for not pronouncing the name of their parliament.

If we go to the United Kingdom: [tbc 6.37]

Among its select committees, U.K. parliament has a treasury select committee which, among other tasks, examines the expenditure, administration and policy of the Treasurer, the government's economic and finance minister. The Treasury Committee conducts an ex-anti-scrutiny as part of its work. For example, after a budget statement, the Treasury Committee usually conducts an inquiry into the government's proposals as one aspect of its work. The Treasury Committee secretary consists of a mixture of procedural, economics and finance specialists. The Public Accounts Committee focuses on ex-post-scrutiny, examining government projects, programs and service delivery to consider their value for money.

That makes the distinction there with the U.K., the PAC and the role of the Finance Committee.

Similarly, going back to the Republic of Ireland, the Public Accounts Committee there supports financial scrutiny work alongside its budgetary oversight committee. They have both. They have the public accounts committee and the budgetary oversight committee, which is exactly what this is proposing.

Ms Webb - Not exactly, Ruth. You know that we could have actually - 

Mr PRESIDENT - Order.

Ms Webb - If we'd had a process to examine these, then we could've thought about it.

Mr PRESIDENT - Order. You can't talk across the Chamber.

Ms FORREST - Mr President, to suggest there's not an [inaudible] in other jurisdictions is wrong. I am sorry to speak over you. I apologise, Mr President.

Some have raised concerns about committee experience in the briefings. This is a concern that applies equally to every parliamentary committee. Every member who comes to this place comes from their own background and brings their own experience. Everyone who comes to this place would have a set of skills, not all sets of skills. I don't have an economics or accounting background. In fact, there're some people out in the general people who just like to talk a bit about being just a qualified midwife, which is true, I absolutely am. I am not fit to sit on the PAC.

Mr Edmunds - That's all.

Ms FORREST - That's all. Yep. I find that quite demeaning. When I did take that consideration of actually being Treasurer in the Labor government should Labor form power, that was the criticism that was thrown at me most. After all, I was just a qualified midwife.

That's a challenge for any committee, regardless of the subject matter. I am not an energy expert either, but I'm sitting on the energy committee.

In terms of the solution for that challenge - and it is a challenge. I absolutely accept that. The parliament should represent and protect the people. The people have a range of skills. In terms of your evidence gathering, the committee would hear from Treasury officials, economists, industry experts and stakeholders. You seek expert advice [Bookmark: Phr2_O=8.1_D=29.0_C=0.74]  where it was needed. The committee may engage external advisers. Other committees do and have done, such as the Energy Matters Committee, which sought expert advice, the Public Accounts Committee has done it in the past, and also there was a previous committee chaired by the member for Mersey on the future gaming markets. The member for Mersey may be able to clarify, they had an expert advisor for that committee as well. That's how things work, and other parliaments do the same. We also have a very good parliamentary research service [Bookmark: Phr3_O=37.3_D=5.7_C=0.72] . A lot of our committees currently use them quite extensively, including the Public Accounts Committee.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=44.7_D=23.0_C=0.70] They could be further strengthened: that's an argument, but that again takes extra resourcing and potentially a future Parliamentary Budget Office. Hopefully that will be established. A PBO would provide technical support, but their job is different. Their job is to cost policies for non-government members during non-election periods, and to cost election policies [Bookmark: Phr5_O=68.0_D=12.7_C=0.82]  during election periods, and if the legislation is set up in such a way that they can consider committees' request for information they can do that, but they're not doing the work of the committee.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=83.8_D=14.6_C=0.78] The Public Works Committee, the Public Accounts Committee, the Joint Standing Committee on Integrity, and the Subordinate Legislation Committee all deal with complex technical matters, and we don't suggest that they lack legitimacy because members aren't engineers, economists, accountants, lawyers [Bookmark: Phr7_O=98.8_D=10.1_C=0.69]  or sociologists. We recognise that parliamentary committees gather expertise through their processes. Let me return to the fundamental questions [Bookmark: Phr8_O=109.5_D=14.9_C=0.71] : does parliament have the authority to establish this committee? The answer is unequivocally yes. The parliament has sovereign legislative authority in Tasmania. The parliament has the constitutional power to structure its own  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=124.8_D=3.0_C=0.81] committees and the parliament has the responsibility to hold the government to account.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=128.9_D=23.8_C=0.77] The precedent exists of committees like the Public Works Committee, with far stronger powers, and that's power over executive decisions. Critics have not identified a single specific constitutional provision in this bill that this bill would violate. They have not pointed to any case law prohibiting such committees. They have not demonstrated any legal impediments to the parliament creating oversight mechanisms of its own design. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=153.6_D=6.5_C=0.58]  What is being done is expressing policy concerns under the guise of constitutional parliamentary overreach.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=161.1_D=12.3_C=0.74] They may believe this committee is unnecessary or unwise or politically problematic, and that may well be the case, but from a policy [Bookmark: Phr13_O=175.0_D=3.7_C=0.76]  point of view, you decide whether you agree with the policy position or you don't.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=180.3_D=27.8_C=0.81] Let me be completely clear about what this bill, particularly as amended, would actually require. It would require the government to have regard to - in other words, consider - any committee recommendations and respond in writing to committee reports within three months. Surely this should be a requirement for all committees.

Members would be aware that this is a requirement of committee reports for GAA and GAB, but many committee secretaries have had to chase responses to these committees for months. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=209.3_D=2.3_C=0.61]  One we were chasing for two years [Bookmark: Phr16_O=212.3_D=1.8_C=0.87] , despite our standing orders. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=215.2_D=8.0_C=0.82]  It should be legislated, to avoid any doubt about the expectation of parliament that the government should provide a formal response to all committee reports.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=223.9_D=28.2_C=0.83] To be clear, the government is not required to adopt any recommendation, meet any target, follow any strategy proposed by the committee, or justify its policy choices. This is the bare-minimum transparency any functional democracy would expect. Government maintains complete discretion over fiscal policy. All this bill does is ensure that discretion is exercised transparently and that the parliament and the community have the opportunity to hold the government to account. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=252.6_D=25.9_C=0.80]  If a government cannot defend its fiscal strategy against parliamentary scrutiny, the problem is with the strategy, not the scrutiny. 

One of the most important features of this bill is it establishes an opportunity for continuous oversight, not opportunistic investigation. Currently, parliamentary scrutiny of fiscal management is primarily locked into annual budget cycles, the budget released normally in May or June [Bookmark: Phr20_O=279.4_D=18.6_C=0.74] , Estimates hearings occurring over the following weeks, and appropriations bills debated and passed. Twelve months later, the cycle repeats. 

The Public Accounts Committee can, does and may follow up with some expenditure decisions, but not regularly overseeing the government's progress on their budgetary management. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=299.4_D=5.6_C=0.80]  Fiscal challenges don't wait for budget day. Decisions affecting long-term sustainability are made constantly. There are new spending commitments, changes to revenue assumptions, revisions to the forward estimates, and responses to economic shocks. A committee that meets only in response to specific matters or only during budget sessions cannot effectively scrutinise these ongoing decisions. We need a standing committee with a continuous mandate: exactly what this bill creates.

To ensure that the committee operates as intended, there is the review clause included. I recognise the feedback from the member for Mersey. It was an error that I made, which I appreciate him picking up, that the latest the review should be done is eight years. It can be done after four. The committee needs time to do the work and then be evaluated, at least after four years, but definitely by eight years, and the review needs to be completed in 12 months. This ensures that if the committee becomes ineffective, parliament would have evidence-based findings to guide reform. Therefore, the committee itself is accountable. Its operations will be scrutinised and assessed, and if it doesn't deliver value, it can be reformed or abolished. 

At its core, this poses a simple question: do we believe Tasmanians deserve transparent, continuous, effective scrutiny of how this government manages public finances? If the answer is yes, this bill is necessary. Some governments may find this scrutiny uncomfortable. Some treasurers may prefer operating without a committee examining their fiscal strategies. Some might prefer the current system, where the Treasury budget review panel operates in secret. Annual budget scrutiny is limited and no committee has a clear mandate to assess the adherence to sound fiscal management principles. 

However, comfort for the government is not the standard; accountability to the people is the standard. To me, the choice before this parliament is clear. We can maintain the status quo. That's what I'm hearing so many members come and argue for: a system where retrospective accountability is strong, but prospective oversight is weak, where annual scrutiny is intensive, but continuous scrutiny and oversight is absent. The Public Accounts Committee does excellent work on what has been spent, but no committee examines whether what the government has planned is sustainable.

Or we can recognise that unprecedented fiscal challenges require enhanced oversight mechanisms, that transparency and accountability are strengthened, not weakened, by clear legislative mandates, and that parliament's duty to hold government accountable extends to forward-looking fiscal strategy, not just backward-looking expenditure review. This bill, particularly if it was proceeded with proposed amendments, is constitutionally sound. It respects the separation of powers by making recommendations, not binding directions. It includes explicit provisions confirming government is not required to comply with recommendations. 

This bill is necessary. The deteriorating fiscal position, despite existing mechanisms, demonstrates inadequacy of the current oversight. We need continuous forward-looking scrutiny, specifically focused on fiscal sustainability. The bill is complementary. It works with, not against, the Public Accounts Committee. It fills a gap. It doesn't create duplication. The consultation provisions ensure coordination between committees. The bill is accountable. It provides review provisions to assess the committee's effectiveness and reform it if necessary. The bill is transparent. Unlike the Treasurer's secret budget panel, this committee would operate in public, table reports in parliament and ensure government responses are on the record.

This bill is proportionate. As amended, it would require the government only to consider the recommendations and explain its decisions: the minimum transparency any democracy would expect. Critics of this bill have raised concerns about overreach, duplication, and constitutional propriety. I've addressed all of these concerns in detail and demonstrated why, upon examination, they do not withstand scrutiny. What remains is a simple proposition: that parliament should have a clear, continuous mechanism to scrutinise fiscal sustainability and hold the government accountable for adherence to the principles of sound fiscal management that the parliament itself has established. 

We create those principles. We enacted them into law. We require the government to follow them, but we created no committee with an explicit mandate to hold the government accountable for that adherence. This committee is a response to that gap. It is about vital change to make sure the parliament's fiscal accountability processes catch up and respond to, and reflect, the current fiscal and economic environment. 

It is part of the continuous process of reforming and adapting the state's fiscal management framework. I have no doubt members of this place, whatever their views on particular fiscal policy, share a commitment to transparency, accountability, and responsible fiscal management. This bill advances all three. Members have a choice. Do we support this committee and improve scrutiny and transparent oversight of the government's fiscal management of the state - a state in the worst fiscal position it's ever been? Members can choose to support a process that enables open and transparent accountable processes that will build the parliament's and members' understanding of the challenges we face, and a process that would also inform the public through public and transparent processes. 

Or members can choose to maintain the status quo and hope things improve. The people of Tasmania deserve no less than a parliament that takes seriously its responsibilities to oversee how their money is managed, not just how it was spent yesterday, and whether the plans for spending tomorrow are sustainable. 

Mr President, before my final comment, I would also like to acknowledge and thank David Bailey, a former long-serving Treasury official and former ministerial adviser who has long experience in this space, who has seen about 30 budgets delivered, who has a very deep commitment to effective fiscal management. He supported me in this process. It's not just some idea that I had. I've worked with him and I really appreciate his input, particularly from a Treasury point of view. I would like to acknowledge that. He's been extremely helpful and I thank him for his commitment for being here today and also attending briefings with me over the past week or so. 

Mr President, I commend the bill to the House and I seek member support to support it into the committee stage.

CUSTODIAL INSPECTOR AMENDMENT (PROTECTION FROM REPRISAL) BILL 2025 (No. 44) 

[8.04 p.m.] 
Ms O'CONNOR - Mr President, I move - 

That the bill be now read the second time.

All of us understand, or we should understand, the integral role that whistleblowers play in shining light into dark places. If not for the courage of whistleblowers in Tasmania, this place and the broader Tasmanian community would not have the understanding that they do of the historical, and at times contemporary, circumstances faced by young people in Ashley Youth Detention Centre. It was the courage of whistleblowers and victim-survivors whose stories led to the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry, so we do need to make sure that there are strong whistleblower protections in place.

At the outset, I will indicate that we have two amendments for this bill. During debate in the other place, the Attorney General proposed a number of amendments for us to consider before bringing on the bill in this place. I would like to acknowledge the work of my colleague, the member for Bass, spokesperson on corrections, Cecily Rosol, and our advisers in developing this bill to this point. Subsequent discussions narrowed down the proposed amendments to two, and we've prepared amendments to address these two matters in response to the government's requests. 

The Custodial Inspector Act 2016 was enacted almost a decade ago. Since the act's inception, it's only been amended twice, via the Public Sector Superannuation Reform Consequential and Transitional Provisions Act 2016 and the Dangerous Criminals and High Risk Offenders Act 2021. Both acts only made minor consequential amendments. In nine years of operation of this act, it has not had any substantive amendment. 

Section 26(2)(c) of the principal act requires that the Custodial Inspector's annual report contains 'any recommendations for changes in the laws of the state or for administrative action that the inspector considers should be made as a result of the performance of the inspector's functions'.

In their 2020-21 annual report, the inspector first published recommendations under this section of the act. In the inspector's words:[tbc]

It has become evident that the legislative provisions for inspection reports result in a cumbersome and drawn-out process which potentially risks compromising the inspector's independence. The inspector recommended that the act be amended to allow for the custodial inspector to table their reports themselves, rather than through the minister, and that the time frames involved in the tabling be reduced.

Clause 6 of our bill amends section 15 of the principal act to provide that the inspector is to table their own report, rather than the minister. It's from the inspector straight to the parliament. The clause also reduces the time frame for tabling from 'not before 30 days' after the report has been provided to the minister to 'not before seven days'.

We're embracing the new cooperative parliamentary arrangements. During debate in the House of Assembly, the Attorney-General indicated that the government believes seven days is not a reasonable time frame for the government, the minister, to consider the report before tabling. A week might be a long time in politics, but seven days is indeed a short period of time as these matters go. The custodial inspector's recommendations didn't provide for an explicit time frame, just for a time frame shorter than 30 days. On this basis, we are prepared to increase the time frame to 14 days. We understand the custodial inspector is comfortable with this amendment.

The proposed power for the custodial inspector to table their own reports is not unique. The national preventive mechanism under section 19(2) of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 has the power to table their own inspection reports. The Integrity Commission, under section 11(3) of the Integrity Commission Act 2009, can table a report on any matter arising in connection with the performance of its functions or exercise of its powers. The Ombudsman under section 28(6) of the Ombudsman's Act 1978 can table a report arising from an investigation themselves. Similarly, the Audit Office and the Commissioner for Children and Young People both have the authority to table their own reports of this nature. The only example that we can find of an independent body that cannot table their own investigation reports is the Health Complaints Commission special reports. 

The current requirement for the custodial inspector to go through the minister is very much the exception rather than the norm. This recommendation has been reiterated in the inspector's subsequent annual reports. The 2022-23 Custodial Inspector annual report made this recommendation, which was joined by a range of others. First among these was a call for protections from reprisal. In the inspector's words: [tbc]

Unfortunately, some people who've raised their concerns with my office have also reported that their actions in speaking with my office were sometimes not well received. There are no protections for people who do come forward to report issues to my office. There should be.

The custodial inspector recommended provisions similar to those in section 36 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021.

Clause 9 of our bill introduces protection from reprisal provisions consistent with this recommendation. The clause would introduce a new section 25(a) that prohibits a person from prejudicing or threatening to prejudice a person's safety or career, intimidating, harassing or threaten to intimidate or harass a person, take a detrimental action or permitting another person to do any of the above to a person in response to a person providing information to the inspector. 

The penalty for a reprisal is up to 240 penalty units, which in today's dollars is $48,480, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both. Of course, it is a very serious matter to subvert public interest disclosures of any kind, which is why this penalty, in our view, is proportionate. In addition to section 36 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021, similar provisions can be found in section 19 of the Public Interest Disclosures Act 2002, and that's another act that does need significant reform and the attention of the parliament [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.4_D=2.5_C=0.86]  and certainly something the Greens are keen to progress.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=29.0_D=0.8_C=0.84]  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=37.4_D=27.1_C=0.86] Section 54(2) of the Integrity Commission Act 2009 also provides a broad protection against violence, punishment, damage, loss, or disadvantage to another person for or on account of that person having given evidence. In addition to provisions that provide protection from reprisal, the Custodian Inspector notes that section 35 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 provides [Bookmark: Phr5_O=64.6_D=29.3_C=0.83]  considerable discretion in being able to share information that would assist in the work to improve conditions of people in places of detention.

Clause 10 of this bill amends section 34 of the principal act to extend protections for the provision of information on similar terms to section 35 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021. This clause extends the coverage to provision of information made for the purposes of the act [Bookmark: Phr6_O=94.2_D=16.8_C=0.84]  rather than just under the act and extends to civil liability as well as adding a qualifier that the protections only apply in so far as the information was made, the disclosure was made, the information provided in good faith. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=111.9_D=12.5_C=0.81]  Our second amendment relates to this clause. As currently drafted our bill does not apply solely to information provided to the custodial inspector or an office of the custodial inspector.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=125.7_D=29.4_C=0.83] In contrast, section 35 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 applies to information provided to the National Preventive Mechanism of the Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture and other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment of the Committee against Torture, established in accordance with the Optional Protocol. The current section 34 of the principal act does not apply solely to information provided [Bookmark: Phr9_O=155.3_D=12.2_C=0.78]  to the custodial inspector or an officer of the custodial inspector. On this basis, when drafting, we retain the broad application so as not to inadvertently weaken this provision.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=168.1_D=20.4_C=0.81] As we understand it, the custodial inspector is comfortable with the government's proposal to have this provision only apply to information provided to the custodial inspector or an officer of the custodial inspector. The amendment very closely resembles the provisions in section 35 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=190.3_D=8.6_C=0.67] The Custodial Inspector's 2022-23 Annual Report also noted the information sharing powers of the Custodial Inspector are quite limited. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=199.8_D=13.5_C=0.84]  Section 24(4) of the Custodial Inspector Act 2016 allows for information sharing with the Integrity Commission, Coroner or Auditor-General, and section 30 allows information to be shared with the Ombudsman. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=214.0_D=12.1_C=0.82]  The Custodial Inspector notes there are no similar provisions allowing information to be shared with the Health Complaints Commissioner, Anti-Discrimination Commissioner and Commissioner for Children and Young People, for example.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=226.6_D=11.8_C=0.83] In contrast, Section 22 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 allows information to be shared with, amongst other entities, public authorities and the responsible minister. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=239.0_D=23.6_C=0.83]  Clause 8 of this amendment bill introduces a new subsection (4A) to section 24 of the principle act to allow information to be shared with public authorities and the responsible minister. The Custodial Inspector also noted that current provisions of the act prevent the inspector from delegating powers to consultants [Bookmark: Phr16_O=263.5_D=5.4_C=0.81]  or advisers. The practical concern is that it is necessary to acquire a gate pass [Bookmark: Phr17_O=269.2_D=14.6_C=0.86]  in order for consultants or a delegate to be granted access, which means that conducting an unannounced inspection without the Tasmania Prison Service being made aware of the inspection, is not possible. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=284.7_D=5.4_C=0.84]  The inspector recommended that changes be made that allow for them to delegate [Bookmark: Phr19_O=290.8_D=10.0_C=0.86]  some of their powers to consultants. Clauses 4 and 5 amend sections 4 and 10 of the Custodial Inspectors Act respectively [Bookmark: Phr20_O=302.8_D=2.2_C=0.78]  to ensure that persons appointed for purposes of the carrying out of an inspection can have the powers delegated to them. The final recommendation of the inspector that this bill addresses is the request for an amendment to section 17, to clarify that officers of the inspector also have the power to engage confidentially with prisoners or detainees.

The recommendations of the Custodial Inspector should not be controversial. They should be supported, and I hope Council will support the recommendations that would be given effect through our amendment bill. Many of these amendments are small, practical changes that have become apparent over the nine years of the act's operation, that would enable the act and the inspector to operate as they were always intended to.

Other amendments, like protections from reprisal and the ability to directly table investigation reports, are the common standard with similar bodies and legislation. They will serve to improve the independence and effectiveness of the Custodial Inspector, as well as the safety of those who disclose information to the inspector. This year's 'Custodial Inspector Annual Report' notes this bill that we are debating today and makes no further recommendations. I do hope Council supports this bill, and supports the amendments, and I commend the bill to the House.

[8.17 p.m.]
Ms THOMAS (Elwick) - Mr President. I rise to speak in support of the Custodial Inspector Amendment (Protection from Reprisal) Bill 2025, and I acknowledge that the Custodial Inspector Act was brought in almost a decade ago, and as the member for Hobart pointed out, there have been only minor consequential amendments since, and I thank the member for Hobart for bringing this bill to us today.

The act has only had only minor consequential amendments over the past decade, despite the fact that the annual reports of the Custodial Inspector in 2020-21 and 2022-23 made recommendations for amendments to improve the capacity of the Custodial Inspector to effectively perform their role, improve the governance and timeliness of reports to the parliament and, importantly, to ensure people feel safe and protected in speaking out and reporting issues to the Custodial Inspector.

It's disappointing that the government hasn't acted on these recommendations sooner, but really, it is fortunate that we have a minority government and a parliament with non-government members who have the motivation, the passion and resources to listen to and act on recommendations by our independent authorities. Again, I thank the Greens and the member for Hobart for their work in bringing these amendments to the parliament.

I'm pleased the government saw sense, through the hiatus caused by the unnecessary recent election, and changed their mind on this and on their initial opposition to these amendments that were voiced in the other place earlier in the year when the bill was first tabled. I am supportive of all the specific amendments, but I do have a couple of questions I would like the Greens member to answer and reply if they are able to, please, and I will summarise my support for the amendments and ask the questions as I go along.

Of course, it makes sense that the Custodial Inspector tables their reports in the parliament rather than this power or responsibility resting with the minister, and I understand that this is consistent with other independent statutory authorities, including the Integrity Commission, Commissioner for Children and Young People, and the National Preventive Mechanism, or NPM under OPCAT, a role that's concurrently held by our Custodial Inspector, as is the role of Ombudsman, which can also table their own reports, as can the Auditor-General.

I support the amendments to section 15 to enable the Custodial Inspector to table their own reports in the parliament and to shorten the period within which the report is tabled, as per the proposed amendment, to be within seven days or 14 days of providing a copy to the minister, rather than within 30 days, as the current act provides.

Ultimately, I support it being sooner. I do know that the Health Complaints Commissioner, a role that is also concurrently held by the Ombudsman, together with the roles of NPM and Custodial Inspector, cannot table their own health complaint reports, which would now appear to be an anomaly that perhaps needs addressing. This is not a question for the Greens, but perhaps something the government can consider. Unless there is good reason why the health commissioner should not or cannot table their own reports in parliament. Speaking of all these statutory roles and responsibilities allocated to one independent person, what a task that is. Whilst the government has, or may, talk up the fact that theoretically we're leading the nation in that our Ombudsman has the power to visit all places of deprivation of liberty, it's no use having the power if you don't have the resources to carry out this role effectively.

In a media release of 18 October 2024, then-Custodial Inspector/NPM Richard Connock reiterated his earlier calls for more funding for the Office of the National Preventive Mechanism. In releasing the Office of the Custodial Inspector Annual Report 2023-2024, Mr Connock expressed his disappointment that the establishment of the Office of the Tasmanian National Preventive Mechanism, or NPM, had stalled due to a lack of government funding, saying: [tbc]

The NPM represents an opportunity to expand the proactive mandate of the Custodial Inspector to prevent ill treatment in police and court custody, and importantly, to non-custodial settings. This includes places such as secure mental health facilities, aged residential care, and disability support facilities. Successive Royal Commissions and Commissions of Inquiry have highlighted the need for increased monitoring in these places where people are deprived of their liberty. 

Despite significant investment from the Tasmanian Government to scope the requirements of establishing the Tasmanian NPM, the recommendations arising from this project have been met with relative silence. It is my hope that the next NPM will be able to build upon the nation-leading work done in Tasmania to date. This includes demonstrating the benefit increased monitoring will have in preventing ill treatment in Tasmania where people are deprived of their liberty, custodial or otherwise. Appropriate funding will be essential for the NPM to fulfil its mandate.

Mr Connock could not be clearer on the need for increased funding if this important role is to be carried out effectively, so I really hope this week's budget reflects that, or else the government had better stop suggesting it's leading the nation in this area because it actually isn't, in practice, and can't, unless it properly resources it. I note and apologise that I digress a little from the contents of the bill, however, part of the intent of the bill, insofar as I see it, is to ensure the custodial inspectors can effectively perform their roles. An adequate budget is critical for that.

I will take every opportunity to put on the record my support for the calls of independent oversight authorities to be properly resourced, or else there is little point having them, and there have been quite a number of them established under this government and even in my short time in this place so far. It's a shame we live in a society where we need them, but we do, and they are vital for protecting some of the most vulnerable people in our community.

Back to the amendments proposed in this bill. Of course, I support amendments to section 25 to protect people who come forward and report issues to the Office of the Custodial Inspector. People should never be held back from doing so for fear of retribution. Not staff members, nor family members, or people in custody themselves. No-one. In the media release of 18 October 2024, then-Custodial Inspector Richard Connock reiterated his call on the state government for adequate protection from reprisals for people raising concerns through his office, saying:[tbc]

If the teenager who initially reported the Hostile Management Regime hadn't done so due to fear of reprisal, then we wouldn't have been able to raise it with TPS and have it stopped. While people can contact us anonymously, and we strive to protect the identity of people who provide us with information, sometimes assumptions and conclusions can be drawn from the circumstances being reviewed and reported on. There are no protections against reprisal targeting those who have spoken with my office. There should be. 

It is important that the state government address this legislative defect in the interests of improving the welfare of people in custody and those who work with them.

There is an example of where something may not have been changed if the brave teenager who reported it had feared reprisal. Sadly, we don't know how many issues haven't been reported over the last decade because these legislative provisions have not existed. We can't change that. We can't change the past, but we can put those protections in place from now on, and we should, as Mr Connock said.

I also support the amendments to section 10 of the act in relation to delegation of the Custodial Inspector's functions and powers to include any person appointed by the inspector for the purposes of the carrying out of an inspection, and I understand the rationale outlined in the second reading speech for this. However, my question is, by what process is any person appointed, and is there a register of persons appointed that is maintained? I also wondered whether consideration was given to amending the regulations to cover this delegation under the existing provision 10(b) in the act, which provides for a person or class of persons prescribed by the regulations, rather than amending the act.

I support the amendment to section 24 to enable the custodial inspector to disclose information to a public authority or the minister, and I note 'public authority' has the same meaning as that defined in the Ombudsman Act 1978.

The changes to section 34 relating to the protection for provision of information makes sense and goes hand-in-hand with the amendments to section 25. However, I note it is a fair departure from the current wording. I wonder if the member for Hobart, in summing up, can please detail how this wording was arrived at and whether it exists in any other acts.

I also wonder if the member for Hobart can clarify how is 'in good faith' defined or tested.

Finally, does the inclusion of whether the information is true or false mean a person could make false claims about the conduct of another with no recourse for defamation?

To finish, I note the work of the Office of the Custodial Inspector and thank all of the staff for the work they undertake across the breadth of roles and responsibilities assigned to this office by statute. I thank Richard Connock for his service to Tasmania and its people in the role, and I welcome Grant Davies to the roles of Ombudsman, Custodial Inspector, Health Complaints Commissioner, National Preventative Mechanism and Coordinator of the Official Visitors Programme. I wish him all the very best in continuing on the calls of Mr Connock in convincing the government to separate and appropriately resource these roles. I support the Custodial Inspector Amendment (Protection From Reprisal) Bill.

[8.27 p.m.]
Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, I rise very briefly to speak on this bill, and I'm very happy to be doing so. Thank you to the Greens and to the member for Hobart in this place on their behalf for bringing this bill forward for us to consider and debate. It is an incredibly important piece of work and made possible in the context of a minority parliament, which the member for Elwick has also mentioned. That is worthy of mentioning.

The reason that's worthy of mentioning is we all here would acknowledge the incredible importance of the role of our independent statutory oversight entities, and we have legislated for these entities to be in place to undertake that oversight role in order to ensure Tasmanians are protected, that decision-making and government are accountable, and to make sure that our systems work as well as we want and expect them to.

The attitude of a government towards the independent statutory oversight entities is writ large in two ways in my view. It is writ large and demonstrated in the way that those entities are treated by government, primarily through both the extent to which they are funded sufficiently in government budgets, and the response that a government makes to the recommendations made by those oversight entities. On that front, it's clear what this government thinks of our independent statutory oversight entities, and they don't think much of them, when you look at the fact that they're chronically underfunded year after year. To the extent that, as the member for Elwick alluded to we have noted many times in this place, in these last couple of years, the heads of those independent oversight entities have had to come into the public domain to plead their case for the lack of funding that they received to just do the basic work that under statute they're required to do. It's shocking we see that.

I am sure the people leading these entities got to the absolute end of their tether, exhausting all private direct entreaties to government on the matters of funding, before they get to the point of coming into the public domain and stating that they need that funding to do the basic work they're required to do under the acts that establish them. That's appalling. It's a blatant statement about the value that this government places on those entities.

The other side of it is how are the recommendations made by the entities responded to? Is there a prompt, welcoming response where recommendations are actioned and put into place through policy and processes? Typically, no. That's what this bill is a result of. Year after year when these recommendations have come forward for just sensible law reform, quite frankly, to update the act that underpins the custodial inspector. Basic law reform to make sure the functions of the office can be undertaken appropriately, that people are protected appropriately when they're engaging with the custodian inspector and the like, as we've heard from the member for Hobart in relation to what's in this bill.

The lack of response to those recommendations made speaks volumes. It's a blatant and obvious indication of a government that really does not care about or for independent statutory oversight. It's shameful, quite frankly. In that context - and because we have a minority government situation in this parliament, we now have at least the opportunity and the great pleasure actually in seeing something progressed on behalf of a statutory entity to improve the way it's able to do its work, to provide better protections, to make sensible basic law reform to the act that underpins it in the face of that neglect for many years. It's great to see that.

I would really hope we would see some different indications from this government in relation to oversight entities such as the custodial inspector, but of course all the others. When it comes to the interim budget we'll be seeing later this week, I don't hold out much hope. I am not going to hold my breath, that's for sure.

We do know that, particularly - the member for Elwick mentioned this, and I'm going to reiterate it because we have discussed it already other times that we've talked about the last two budgets in this place, or the attempted budget earlier this year and the one before it last year. The Tasmanian National Preventative Mechanism established under our OPCAT act has only been around for a couple of years. We can all remember, those of us who were here, passing that act a couple of years back. It was a nation-leading thing to do at the time. We were really on the front foot. Then, after funding being provided for the development of the office and the role, what then needed to happen was for a new approach to funding that office that would actually fund it to do the role. That was last year. Guess what? Absolutely no funding to do the role. We were literally told by the NPM, which was the also the custodial inspector, also the Ombudsman, that they didn't have the funding available to go out and do the inspections that were required under the act. None. Could do none of the activity legislated. Absolutely shocking.

If that's the case on Thursday when we look at this interim budget, my goodness me. That will be every single member of this government saying that they do not care about or value the work of oversight entities. It is as simple as that.

I am not going to go into detail through each of the elements of the bill. The member for Hobart took us through them in detail, and I agree that they're sensible. I appreciate the questions the member for Elwick has put. I am really keen to hear the answers and some further explanation around some of those. I am more than happy to be supportive of this bill.

[8.34 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I rise to make this contribution on the Custodial Inspector Amendment Protection from Reprisal Bill 2025 put forward by the Greens.

The Tasmanian government is a strong supporter of the custodial inspector, establishing the position in 2016 to provide independent and proactive oversight of custodial facilities. Over the past decade the government has invested heavily in a stronger, safer and better equipped correction system. However, it is acknowledged there is more to be done and more improvements that can be made.

It is clear that there will always be many challenges within the corrections system in any jurisdiction. Sadly, that's the nature of any prison and correction system that deals with people that are held in custody for the safety of the community and the interests of justice as determined by the courts. 

I'd like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the exceptionally hard work of our corrections and community corrections officers. They do a very important job and without them, our justice and corrections system [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.3_D=1.2_C=0.92]  could not function.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.2_D=28.7_C=0.86] The custodial inspector provides an important oversight of the corrective services system in this state. The role was created to ensure that the Tasmanian Prison Service (TPS) is working to continuously improve the prison service and delivering an effective, accountable and humane custodial service. The custodial inspector conducts regular inspections of prisons, assessing various themes [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.1_D=24.9_C=0.84]  against their expectations, and provides comprehensive reports and recommendations based on those inspections. These reports are provided to the minister for Justice and tabled in the parliament. The government is committed to addressing any issues raised by the custodial inspector in his reports, and work is constantly occurring to address the issues that have been raised.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=84.7_D=5.0_C=0.80] The inspector's work ensures that Tasmania provides a safe and constructive environment [Bookmark: Phr6_O=90.4_D=29.1_C=0.85]  in which offenders can address their offending behaviour and prepare to return into the community safely. The TPS senior managers meet specifically to review recommendations from the Custodial Inspector and to progress actions on a monthly basis. I note the minister for Corrections and Rehabilitation meets with the custodial inspector regularly to discuss the progress of reports and any pressing issues [Bookmark: Phr7_O=119.7_D=11.4_C=0.86]  that may arise. I am advised that the Director of Prisons also meets with the custodial inspector on a quarterly basis to discuss issues that may have risen.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=131.8_D=21.7_C=0.85] Since the establishment of the custodial inspector position, the government and TPS have committed to actioning 493 recommendations, and 374 of those recommendations have been completed.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=154.9_D=26.8_C=0.83] I acknowledge the outgoing inaugural Custodial Inspector, who has also been acknowledged here today for his work, Mr Richard Connick, who retired on 11 July this year. 

The Custodial Inspector Act 2016 was created by the Tasmanian Liberal Government to establish an independent custodial inspector to provide oversight of custodial [Bookmark: Phr10_O=182.6_D=2.7_C=0.81]  centres in Tasmania, such as prisons and [Bookmark: Phr11_O=185.7_D=18.8_C=0.77]  youth detention centres. Mr Connick established the Office of the Custodial Inspector in 2017. His tenure leaves a legacy of systemic improvements in Tasmanian custodial sentences, and it's important that we acknowledge his work.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=205.7_D=13.9_C=0.85] The intent of this bill is recognised and acknowledged. It's noted that a number of issues raised in this bill are already dealt with sufficiently in the act, however, the government does not oppose clarification. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=220.5_D=15.9_C=0.88]  Following advice from the Department of Justice, the government supports the intentions of the bill with no objections. 

The government supports the protection for the provision of information and notes that there are already protections in place [Bookmark: Phr14_O=236.6_D=8.5_C=0.85]  where staff make disclosures under the Public Interest Disclosure scheme to the Secretary, Ombudsman or Integrity Commission.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=245.8_D=24.9_C=0.84] In relation to the provisions around delegation and access, the government considers that the powers and delegations referred to are, in practice, already available under section 10 of the Custodial Inspector Act 2016, where: 

The Inspector may delegate any of his or her functions or powers under this Act, other than this power of delegation [Bookmark: Phr16_O=271.6_D=2.8_C=0.75] , to -

(a)	any officer or employee made available to enable the Inspector to perform and exercise his or her functions and powers; and

 [Bookmark: GS10@Hpb@EN] (b)	a person, or class of persons, prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=301.3_D=3.7_C=0.83] Therefore, as per the current act, the custodial inspector can already delegate their functions or powers to any officer or employee made available to enable the inspector to perform and exercise their functions and powers. The government is therefore not opposed to the Greens further amending section 10 to provide more certainty in this legislation.

Consultation leading to the amendments: in bringing this bill to the Legislative Council, the government would like to thank the Greens for responding to points made by the minister during the debate in the other place. Just as a note, the amendments had not been provided to the Clerks prior to this debate, and we have Standing Orders that facilitate that and require that and obviously - 

Ms O'Connor - I circulated to all the members, but hadn't circulated to the Clerks.

Ms RATTRAY - Yes, and they are the ones who have the expertise as well, but obviously -

Ms O'Connor - No one raised that with me earlier, so I will address that.

Ms RATTRAY - Just for future reference, as we may well see a number of these bills come before the parliament in this new arrangement. 

Clause 6, with the version of the bill which passed through the House of Assembly, under clause 6, section 15 of the principal act is amended to, among other things, shorten the timeframe for the government to table custodial inspector reports from 30 days to seven.

Most states have a two-step process for reports: a time period to comment on the draft report, then a further period between receipt of the final report and tabling. In Tasmania, the act explicitly provides that a further response can be provided to the report in that second time period. In consultation with the Greens, it was decided that 14 days was a more appropriate timeframe for the government to table a report, giving the government and the Tasmania Prison Service enough time to consider and respond to the report.

In relation to clause 10, the new section 34 is modelled on a similar provision in section 35 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021, which relates to provision of information to a Tasmanian national preventative mechanism or the subcommittee. The government supports the amendments to the bill by the Greens, which brings the clause in line with section 35 of the OPCAT act. I am advised that Dr Davies is very supportive of this amendment to the bill and, in conclusion, looks forward to continuing to work with the custodial inspector to achieving ongoing improvements in our custodial facilities. 

Before I take my seat, in response to the member for Elwick's call, the government commits to reviewing section 13(2) of the Health Complaints Act 1995 to bring it in line.

Ms Thomas - Excellent. Thank you.

Ms RATTRAY - You just have to ask.

[8.43 p.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - Mr President, I thank the member for Elwick and member for Nelson for their contributions and support for our amendment bill. I also acknowledge the presence in the Council Chamber today of my friend and colleague, the member for Bass, Cecily Rosol, who was leading the work on this bill that is before us today. 

A number of questions were asked by the member for Elwick, and I want to note at this point how hard the member for Elwick works. I had questions from the member for Elwick - I think it was on Thursday or Friday last week - detailed questions where, obviously, a lot of work had already gone into examining this bill that's before us today. The questions might have arrived on Saturday. I don't mean to - the days are all blurring at the moment, but I note that a lot of work had already gone into understanding this amendment bill and seeking some clarity on significant questions. I will just go through some of those questions now and place our responses on the record. 

The member for Elwick asks: by what process is any person appointed under the section 10 amendments, and is there a register of persons appointed maintained?

The response is: the amendments to section 10 are intended to allow the inspector to provide delegations to contractor appointments, in particular to provide for powers of entry where necessary, and not to provide powers for contractor appointment. Any such appointments would therefore occur using existing powers. We're unaware of the specific, if any, provisions governing contractor appointments by independent statutory authorities. To our knowledge, there isn't a register of appointments or a public register of delegation instruments. 

The member for Elwick also asked whether consideration was given to amending the regulations to cover this delegation under the existing provision of 10(b) of the principal act, which provides for a person, or class of persons prescribed by the regulations, rather than amending the act. Yes, the Custodial Inspector has recommended that these provisions be introduced as regulations, which, as the member has noted, is allowed for under the current section. The problem is that regulations can only be produced by the government, and there wasn't much action happening there even though the first request for amendments had come through in the 2020-21 Custodial Inspector Annual Report, some four or five years ago. There was no action on regulations on the part of government, which is why we took the approach of a legislative amendment.

While regulations can be amended via legislation, it's a bit more complicated and would have made for a more cumbersome bill. Ultimately, we do not have a preference regarding whether the provisions be included in the act or regulations, and have opted for a drafting choice which is more straightforward and before us today. 

The member for Elwick notes the changes to section 34 relating to the protection for provision of information make sense, and go hand-in-hand with the amendments to section 25, but also that it's a fair departure from the current wording:

I wonder if the member for Hobart can please detail how this wording was arrived at, and whether it exists in any other acts.

These provisions, as drafted, were adapted from section 35 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021. This was recommended as the model to follow. When preparing the bill, we noted that a full adoption of section 35 would have had the effect of narrowing some elements of the existing section 34 of the Custodial Inspectors Act 2016. Section 34 of the principal act currently doesn't apply specifically to information provided to the Custodial Inspector, or an officer of the Custodial Inspector, whereas section 35 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 applies only to information provided to a Tasmanian national preventative mechanism, or the subcommittee under OPCAT. 

When drafting this bill, we adapted section 35 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 to reflect the non-specificity of who the information is provided to, as is present in the current section 34, as we didn't want to inadvertently narrow the existing protections. We have, however, prepared an amendment that would reverse this drafting decision and provide that it only applies to information provided to the Custodial Inspector or an officer of the Custodial Inspector. This was a suggestion made by government. As we understand it, the Custodial Inspector is comfortable with this suggestion. It's on this basis that we're comfortable adopting this recommended amendment. Should Council vote through this bill on the second reading, we can deal with that in the Committee stage. The amendment as drafted closely resembles sections 35(1) and (2) of of the OPCAT Implementation Act. 

There was another very good question from the member for Elwick about how good faith is defined or tested. Of course, there would be a commonsense interpretation of a disclosure or information provided in good faith, but the law isn't always sensible. Good faith relates to the intention behind the disclosure. It would require that the person making the disclosure believed the information to be accurate and that the information was not provided with malicious intent. I believe that would deal with some of the concerns that were raised by the member for Elwick in terms of how you mitigate false claims, malicious claims being made. Well, it's the good faith test that will do that. We don't have the expertise to outline exactly how a court would test this. It is present in section 35 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021, on which this provision is based, and it's present in section 3(33), protection from liability in the principal act.

The final question from the member for Elwick, does the inclusion of whether the information is true or false mean a person could make false claims about the conduct of another with no recourse for defamation? This provision safeguards against defamation in a few ways. First, this matter relates to the in good faith provision. They're connected. This means that if a person provides information that they believe to be accurate without ulterior motive, they're protected, even if the information turns out not to be true or accurate. If a person makes a disclosure for malicious purposes, then the protections don't apply. 

Furthermore, particularly if our amendment is passed, the information is not a public disclosure and therefore doesn't risk defamation in the public domain. The disclosure of information, if pursued, would allow for the custodial inspector to investigate the veracity of a claim. This protection ensures that a person can come forward to the inspector to allow for an investigation without having to gather evidence or worry about personal legal matters. The protections, again, in particular after our amendments, would not provide protection for any further disclosures of the information from the initial discloser or from a third party.

I concur completely with the member for Nelson's observations about the government's attitudes towards statutory independent oversight entities. It is one of those situations where the proof kind of is in the pudding. We have had chronically underfunded Integrity Commission, National Preventative Mechanism, Ombudsman, statutory entities that are existing on the smell of an oily rag. In some cases, like the National Preventative Mechanism, as we've heard before committees are so starved of funds that they're unable to perform their statutory function.

The same with the Integrity Commission, year after year. It is not that they can't perform their statutory function. They've been asking for top-up funding so they can do their work, but they've also been asking for a series of fixes or amendments to be made to the Integrity Commission Act 2009 and their powers in line with the Cox review recommendations and the Weiss review recommendations.

There's also an extra workload that will be put on the Integrity Commission as a result of the implementation of the commission of inquiry recommendations. Still, nine years after former Justice Cox hands down his report, there is still heel dragging on reforms to enable the Integrity Commission to be able to potentially bare its teeth a little bit more. As we know through no fault of the Integrity Commission itself, there's been an erosion of public faith in the Integrity Commission. In significant part, that will go to funding issues and the fact that they're hobbled by an act which needs an overhaul and the recipe for the overhaul is largely in the Cox review recommendations.

We will take the government on a cautious trust in their assurances to us and other members of the crossbench that they're serious about up bringing forward amendments to give effect to the Cox and Weiss review recommendations. But they can't keep dragging this out. We will certainly be looking very closely at Thursday's interim budget because the government cannot pretend that they haven't been told over and over again in public hearings, in the media from time to time when the desperation is such, and in private briefings that their funding is insufficient for them to undertake the statutory responsibilities that this parliament has entrusted to them. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=16.5_D=11.8_C=0.85]  Meanwhile, you have a government that's barrelling on with wanting to spend $2 billion or so of public funds on a stadium, which another independent statutory body has recommended against.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.8_D=24.3_C=0.88] I note the Leader for the Government's contribution in winding up. It is good to hear the words that the government is a strong supporter of our oversight bodies. What we need to see is action and some funding. We have jails that are overcrowded. We have ministers of the Crown who talk tough on crime [Bookmark: Phr4_O=55.8_D=2.5_C=0.91]  at the same time as [Bookmark: Phr5_O=59.0_D=6.0_C=0.80]  the government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the commission of inquiry which require [Bookmark: Phr6_O=67.0_D=22.6_C=0.81]  a more therapeutic response to youth justice issues.

The Leader for the Government says the government is committed to addressing the issues raised by the Custodial Inspector in his reports. I noted a very high number of recommendations the Custodial Inspector has made through investigations that the government [Bookmark: Phr7_O=89.9_D=24.8_C=0.84]  has taken seriously, as I understand it, and responded to. That is encouraging. It is a shame we are here at this point because the government didn't respond to repeated requests in the Custodial Inspector's annual reports going back some five years.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=115.5_D=3.6_C=0.85] I hope members will [Bookmark: Phr9_O=119.5_D=7.9_C=0.90]  support our amendment bill, undertaken as it is on behalf of the Custodial Inspector and his office and the people [Bookmark: Phr10_O=129.3_D=20.6_C=0.83]  whose lives, in many ways, if they are incarcerated in places of detention, are reliant on the Custodial Inspector being able to effectively perform their roles. To undertake their functions in a way that's supported by adequate funding [Bookmark: Phr11_O=150.9_D=2.9_C=0.82]  and legislation that empowers them [Bookmark: Phr12_O=155.5_D=19.6_C=0.81]  to do the necessary protective work, casting their eyes into places of detention, Risdon Prison and Ashley Youth Detention Centre. 

Again, I commend the bill to the House and hope that it will have Council support.

Bill read the second time.

MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY

Leave for Ministers to Appear Before Government Business Scrutiny Committees

[9.05 p.m.]
Mr PRESIDENT - Honourable Members, I have messages from the House of Assembly.

STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT

Member for Murchison - Democratic Innovator of the 21st Century Award

[9.16 p.m.]
Mr PRESIDENT - Before I open the question that we adjourn, I'd just like to acknowledge the honourable member for Murchison, Ruth Forrest, who has been a recipient of a recent award, Democratic Innovators of the 21st Century, in the Politicians Hall of Fame. The honourable member travelled to Athens, the birth place of democracy, to receive this award. It certainly put our Tasmanian parliament on the map, and I'd just like to say congratulations to you for receiving such a high honour.


Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Honourable Mr President, I move - 

That the Council do now adjourn.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Conscience Vote

[9.17 p.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - Mr President, I rise to speak on Adjournment with a request that the leaders of the Liberal, Labor and the Greens parties allow their members to vote with their conscience with a free vote on the matter of the Macquarie Point Stadium. Few would disagree that the final vote on the stadium will be a watershed moment for the people of the state. Undoubtedly, it is one of the most consequential economic and political projects to come before parliament in recent history. It is also one of the most divisive issues facing our Tasmanian communities.

A conscience vote on the stadium will help to address notable causes of community division and distrust, reinforced by a deeply polarising process. The findings of all the independent expert inquiry reports and reviews contradict the diametrically-opposed assertions of government and enthusiastic supporters of the stadium project. For many Tasmanians, the government handling of the project simply does not pass the pub test, which began with the Premier's private dealings with the AFL; the Premier's absolute insistence on Macquarie Point as the only feasible location; the repeated changing of planning processes whenever the scheme faced a challenge; and the disparagement of critical experts instead of addressing the substance of their reports. 

Despite the Premier's repeated assertions, the government's obvious lack of a mandate for the stadium is another obvious failing. Impartial and independent opinion polls have found that a significant majority in the north-west, the north and southern Tasmania oppose the current stadium concept. Moreover, learned planning bodies, well-regarded economists, Hobart City Council and even organisations such as Federal Group, which stand to gain from the benefits of the stadium, oppose it. 

Finally, the government has had to rely on the myopic support of Labor to deliver its numbers on the floor: an opposition in name only. At no time has Labor offered the public a considered response to the specific findings of the Tasmanian Planning Commission (the TPC), or earlier independent reviews. Taken together, the failings of governance and the journey thus far could not have been better designed to invoke cynicism and division within our Tasmanian community. 

In calling for a conscience vote, I note that all members in both houses have a direct responsibility to their respective electorates. I firmly believe the saying 'people before the party.' Politicians' votes should not solely reflect the business stakeholders and industry entities that will directly benefit from a building of a new stadium. I shall address these arguments in more detail, particularly why the three main parties should allow their individual members a free vote on the stadium.

Of the 50 members of parliament, 37 are aligned with one of three parties. We have one independent member who, as Leader for the Government, is also aligned to a party. It can be argued that 38 members in this place, or 76 per cent of our parliamentarians, will be forced to vote with the will of their party. While the Premier has brokered the stadium deal with the AFL, it doesn't mean that all members of the Liberal Party believe it will bring a net benefit to their electorates. Likewise, even though the Labor Party has dropped the ball as providing a functional opposition to the Liberal minority government, it doesn't mean all its members support the stadium. There may be members of the Greens who might vote in favour of the Mac Point Stadium, however, it is my understanding the Greens allow free votes for all of its members on all legislation.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=17.1_D=29.5_C=0.70] The '$375 million, not a red cent more' was just a furphy [?] now a limitless 'build it at any cost' option. How can Labor remonstrate the current dire Tasmanian fiscal circumstances and at the same time support a 'she'll be right' project to the Macquarie Point with arguably no financial constraints? The stadium will only add to Tasmania's erupting volcano of debt. If the stadium build starts, there's no stopping the inevitable financial burden that will affect every Tasmanian.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=47.0_D=28.7_C=0.76] Everything about the stadium screams fiscal irresponsibility. A recent article in The Age echoed the desperate risk of a financially unviable Tasmanian government and the dire impact it will have on our already crumbling credit rating and the nation as our guarantor. Mr President, a conscience vote is where elected members reflect their constituents' interests. Think of moral and ethical examples, such as the same-sex marriage or voluntary assisted dying, and both agreed as conscience votes by a Liberal government.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=76.2_D=18.0_C=0.75] I note that South Australia allows conscious voting on issues relating to gaming and there have been calls for this in other jurisdictions. Such issues parallel the stadium project, given their moral and social significance, direct negative impact on certain groups of constituents, and significant fiscal implications for the entire state.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=94.7_D=28.6_C=0.73] Conscience votes are also used for issues with strong community sensitivities, for instance, a highly controversial debate around daylight savings. In 1959, Mr Steer, a Liberal member, with the support of Michael Hodgman, brought the daylight savings issue to parliament and was allowed a free or conscience vote, again in 1965, and finally succeeded in 1967. Daylight savings was extended in 1981 as a Liberal Party-endorsed free vote. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=124.0_D=7.3_C=0.74]  These moves were all backed with extensive community and stakeholder input, so it can be done, and it can be supported by Liberal governments.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=132.2_D=29.1_C=0.83] For the stadium, the strength of opposing community sentiment provides a clear ethical mandate for it to be treated as a free vote. The last time I spoke about the stadium in this place, I referred to the lack of a popular mandate for the stadium. The premature election in May has made no difference. Its vainglorious for the Premier to claim a stadium mandate on the back of the election, one that's produced another fragile minority government. It's a matter of particular significance to the electors I represent [Bookmark: Phr9_O=161.4_D=15.3_C=0.72] , is at best misguided and at worst, political hubris. 

In my electorate of Mersey and in rural Tasmania more generally, the lack of a clear and established mandate has dire implications. There is a clear and equitable division in the claim, benefits and costs of this venture. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=177.0_D=17.0_C=0.78]  Northern, north-west and west coast Tasmania will see significantly less benefit from the stadium than the Hobart CBD and southern Tasmania. The Tasmanian Planning Commission found that some of the claim benefits would come from redistributing current activities within Tasmania to the detriment of existing venues.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=194.4_D=25.0_C=0.80] However, the government's need to service the debt will impose a massive financial burden that will affect every Tasmanian in every part of the state. The extra costs will have to come from somewhere, and that more than likely means higher taxes, service cuts and job losses in the smorgasbord of financial attrition. Politicians must be directly and personally accountable to those who elect them, and they must not be seen to be hiding behind a directive from their party machine. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=220.0_D=3.8_C=0.71]  Dr Richard Herr just recently, in speaking to the members of this place, stated that [Bookmark: Phr13_O=224.5_D=25.4_C=0.76] , 'The most important role of an elected member is to represent the people of Tasmania.' Dr Herr is experienced in these matters and was quoted in the contentious 2007 Gunns Pulp Mill debate as saying: 

It has to be a conscience vote. It ought to be a conscience vote because it is a planning authority. It's not acting as a legislative body. Therefore no one member of parliament should be directed in any way or by anyone on that decision.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=250.3_D=29.0_C=0.84] It is possible that all 38 party-aligned members are fully supportive of their party's stance. I have no issue with that. The Premier stated on several occasions in the media that all members of parliament will get a chance to vote on Macquarie Point. If that is the case, it should be indeed imperative that the party leaders demonstrate confidence in our parliamentary process, one where each member of parliament must be allowed and strongly encouraged to vote with their conscience.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=280.1_D=17.2_C=0.76] We're at the point in the stadium project where only conscientious political leadership and proper parliamentary representation can offer any hope to redeem public confidence in the process. To be answerable to our electorate addresses genuine community concerns, advance the best interests of Tasmania. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=298.0_D=7.0_C=0.60]  I repeat, conscientious representation, unhindered by party politics and machinations, where parliamentarians reinforce the accepted standards of open and accountable government. Members can then vote with direct reference to the best interests of their constituents. Belated though it might seem, a free vote would allow proper process and be reflective of Tasmania at its best, which is an authentic and truly representative democracy.

In closing, Mr President, I am not asking for members of parliament in this place to change their position on the Macquarie Point Stadium. I am simply requesting that all members have the right to declare their personal opinion. 

I thank honourable members for their consideration of this request and keenly await response from all three party leaders.

The Council adjourned at 9.26 p.m.
