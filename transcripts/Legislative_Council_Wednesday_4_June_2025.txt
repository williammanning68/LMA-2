Budget Papers 2025-26 and Appropriation Bills (No. 1 and No. 2) - Noting

Continued from 3 June 2025 (page 75).

[11.19 a.m.]
Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, I say a heartfelt thankyou to all the members who, when they rose yesterday to make their contributions, offered their congratulations and good wishes on my re-election to this place as the independent member for Nelson. I very much appreciate those sentiments.

I would also like to add my congratulations to the returning member for Pembroke and congratulate and welcome the newly elected member for Montgomery. Elections are a huge effort, not just for the candidates, but especially for family and friends surrounding them, and also the supporters and volunteers who participate in our campaigns. I deeply appreciated the support I received in my re-election campaign. I thank each of the people who contributed in ways large and small to that effort. I especially want to thank my family, on the record here, for their love and support. I could not have done it without them. We all know the toll that it can take.

As I rise to provide my formal response to the 2025-26 state Budget, my recent campaign is very much in my thoughts. During any campaign, we have the opportunity, particularly through door-knocking, to connect and talk with a wide range of constituents more intensively than we might do in the usual course of things. The thousands of conversations that I have had on the doors of Nelson this year are very much the context in which I am looking at this Budget.

A consistent, overwhelming message that was raised unprompted by the people of Nelson on the doors was a loss of trust in this government to make good decisions and deliver good outcomes for the Tasmanian people. These sentiments were almost always expressed in conjunction with one particular illustrative issue, which I will talk about later in my contribution.

These views and concerns about a lack of government capacity and leadership were being raised time and again in many areas that would usually be considered heartland places for the Liberal Party. In fact, it was common for the comments that I heard to be prefaced by the statement: 'I have been a lifelong Liberal voter, but...' This Liberal government's lack of leadership, poor financial management, inability to deliver outcomes, bullying approaches and refusal to listen to the community were among the litany of concerns raised repeatedly across all suburbs of Nelson.

When the budget papers assert this is the fiscal framework by which we are, and I quote, 'building a better Tasmania now and for the future', and further, when we are told, 'This Budget delivers a sensible pathway to surplus', our sceptical response has to be: 'Really?' I believe that the people of Nelson cannot but question the premise of both those assertions. While it would be heartening to take both those statements at face value, particularly during such uncertain times, it would in fact be irresponsible to do so. Instead, on behalf of my community of Nelson, I must query: does this Budget really build a better Tasmania and, if so, for whom? Which Tasmanians will see and feel the benefits of this Budget?

Is it really a sensible pathway or is it in fact a bypass hurtling us off a cliff of no return, a detour perhaps, to avoid hard conversations that require long-term thinking, a detour past genuine collaboration and instead directing us into the cul-de-sac of short-term fixes? These are not mere rhetorical questions; instead, I believe they go to the heart of what a state budget should seek to address. These same questions also go to the heart of the strange and concerning situation of good public policy inertia and malaise that appears to be shrouding the senior leadership levels of this government. Some may ask, what does a public policy malaise have to do with balancing the budget books? It has everything to do with that challenge, as does the crushing crisis in political leadership, laid bare by these budget papers. It is, in fact, playing out in our state this very day.

When examining these 2025-26 budget papers, I went looking for any sign of the much-needed and long-overdue structural reform of our fiscal and financial framework in this state. Where are we building that fundamental foundation? Are we investing in that long-term modernising and intergenerational fiscal infrastructure? The short answer is a resounding no. This government is not building such a necessary component of a better Tasmania. It is not investing in a more robust, fair and sustainable fiscal foundation. It is worthwhile considering the fact that the independent review of state finances undertaken by Mr Saul Eslake was released last August just prior to the delivery of the 2024-25 state Budget. The then-treasurer, Michael Ferguson, stated at the time the independent review provided 'a thought-provoking commentary' and that the government will 'carefully consider and respond to Mr Eslake's findings and recommendations'. Yet, a second state budget later and we have yet to see any confirmation of that promised careful consideration.

Considered structural reform of our financial base is long overdue. As the estimated figures of the $10.7 billion in net debt and projected borrowings in the multi-millions in this Budget confirm, it is urgently needed. In his post-budget analysis released just last week, Mr Eslake made clear that the financial position of Tasmania's public sector continues to deteriorate. Projections are now worse than previously presented, even those presented as recently as February. The outlook for all the key budget aggregates continues to get worse, while the projected slowdown in the rate of growth of operating expenses and decline in capital spending are overly optimistic and unrealistic based on recent decades. This sort of smoke and mirrors, this sort of obfuscation, begins to look like cooking the books. At best, perhaps we could say it is delusional. At worst, it looks misleading.

Mr Eslake also calls out the obfuscation attempts by the government to favourably compare Tasmania to other states and territories as misleading, highlighting that by some metrics Tasmania's finances are the worst of any state or territory, and favourable comparisons rely on ignoring key facts. When it comes to the overarching narrative about Tasmania's financial position presented by the government in these budget papers, at best, as I said, it looks delusional. At worst, to be frank, it looks dishonest.

The state's financial position is even worse when you include Tasmania's non-financial corporation sector. The net debt of Tasmania's non-financial public sector is now forecast to reach $17.6 billion in three years, by 30 June 2028, and $19.9 billion in four years, by 30 June 2029. This means that the non-financial public sector's net interest payments will increase to $854 million in 2028-29. That is close to four times more than the interest payments were in 2023-24. It is an astonishingly steep rise in what we are having to pay in interest payments.

Based on previous experience, we can also perhaps assume that these projections will only get worse over time. Mr Eslake warns that:
Based on these sorts of numbers, there must be a significant risk that Tasmania's credit rating, currently AA+ from S&P and Aa2 from Moody's, but on negative watch from both agencies, could be downgraded which would likely result in Tasmania having to pay higher interest rates on new debt and when rolling over maturing debt.

This so-called sensible pathway appears to have entrenched a compounding trajectory where not only are we taking on more and more unstrategic debt, we are eroding our capacity to manage competitive interest rates. We are going to have to pay more for less with less. This may indeed be a sensible pathway for our creditors, but it is a downward spiral for Tasmanians, who will be at risk of shouldering this debt in real terms.

Mr Eslake reiterates the observation from his independent review of state finances of last August that 'the Government is in the financial pickle it is now in because it kept increasing spending without giving any thought as to how that spending (however justified) should be paid for'. The facts have not changed. Increasing spending from the government has to be paid for either by cutting spending in other places or by raising additional revenue, but, to quote Mr Eslake, the government 'is simply unwilling to do that'.

To be fair, I get that. Nobody is asserting the answer is to indiscriminately raise taxes or impose new ones, but I do repeat my call, as I have made in this place on numerous occasions, as have others, for an independent, expert, comprehensive review of Tasmania's financial framework, including our revenue and taxation mix. This is something we have to address.

For those who see concerning holes and looming social inequity chasms reflected in the current budgetary analysis, a comprehensive, integrated structural financial reform is not optional; it is imperative. We urgently need an independent expert evaluation of our current revenue and taxation measures, our policy settings and available levers for change. Potential and progressive new revenue sources may be identified by such a review, while regressive and harmful practices could also be identified to be brought to a close. Such a comprehensive and independent review would undertake an immediate and long-term health check of our financial framework. Its assessment would cast beyond the short-term view of an annual budget cycle or even further beyond the horizon of election cycles to analyse and test the following things:

First, what are the best progressive levers available to drive innovation in securing positive outcomes such as clean air and water, resilient and equitably supported communities, strong employment and affordable housing, for example? Second, what are the best progressive levers available to identify and reduce activities which harm us, such as land, water and air pollution, for example? Third, what are the regressive levers holding us back? And fourth, how well are we positioned to absorb and counter potential future financial shocks, whether cascading from a global meltdown, another pandemic, or natural causes closer to home?

To reiterate: careful, considered, structural financial reform is not about raising taxes in isolation. It is about developing a modern, fair and future-looking plan to manage our expenditure and revenue sources in a way that meets both the needs of the community, responsibility and care and the fiscal responsibility and diligence; a plan that gets us a more sustainable future, rather than the ever-expanding black hole and chasm of social disadvantage, which is the inevitable trajectory of this government's approach, as exemplified in this state Budget.

A structural review of our financial foundations requires political fortitude, imagination and purpose. It requires the hard and inclusive conversations to be held across our community. Even those who want to accept at face value the rosy descriptions provided in the Treasurer's Budget Speech of a strong and growing Tasmanian economy, then responsible and visionary leadership would seize this moment to capitalise on and invest in that apparent current strong economic position, to undertake a forward-looking financial structural reform assessment process.

Without some form of meaningful structural reform of the financial framework and foundations, I fear the inevitable trajectory of the narrow thinking that underpins these budget papers will lead to future financial chaos and a more inequitable, divided, transient and insecure community here in Tasmania.

Additional to the narrow thinking evident from this government is a crisis in political leadership, noted so prominently on the doors of Nelson and which I am watching with increasing alarm. This is a government in denial, determined to spin and spin and spin as it chases self-serving political expediency rather than being honest and accountable to the Tasmanian people. We see a reliance upon window dressing, rather than genuine problem solving.

We see a government yet again kicking the can down the road, rather than facing up to its responsibility to set our state on a dramatically improved trajectory. Instead of structural reform, we see promises of deck-chair-moving tweaks and short-sighted edges towards the sale of public assets and privatisation. One of the things that concerns me most is this government's ideological inclination in its short-term, electorally focused measures, and its refusal to contemplate genuine longer-term solutions; to be regressive every time instead of actively shepherding our state towards greater equity, which we know is the essential foundation for us all to thrive.

A simple example is the recent $60 energy rebate for every Tasmanian household. This could have made a meaningful difference to those Tasmanians doing it most tough, who are desperately struggling with energy costs as we go into winter. Instead, it is a non-targeted cash splash that will disappear without any significant impact. For people like us in this place, it is not needed and will be barely noticed; while for some Tasmanians who are urgently struggling with energy debt or the risk of disconnection, or who are missing meals to keep the heaters on today, it will be nowhere near enough to change their circumstances.

This rebate, targeted in a progressive scale to deliver the most support to the most disadvantaged Tasmanians, would have been something to celebrate. Instead, as it is, what we have is a great social media post designed to boost the electoral stocks of a flailing government. It is offensive, outright offensive. Quite frankly, this government's ideological refusal to take a progressive approach to government assistance, to have it targeted to deliver a more equitable outcome and make a tangible difference to the disadvantage experienced by our fellow Tasmanians, is verging on criminal.

A similar inclination is the cronyism we see, given expression through corporate welfare from this government: largesse doled out to mates, generally with no strings attached, no accountability to deliver public good outcomes, no metrics on the returned benefit to Tasmanians overall. Instead of the urgently required political leadership, offering a clear and fair vision moving forward, it is apparent this government has a myopic fixation with its ideological skeletons of the past. By that I mean privatisation or public sector cuts, which we are seeing play out here. I am not going to spend too long discussing the privatisation process, identifying potential GBEs and state-owned companies for partial or whole divestment. Both the proposed sale of public assets and specific and targeted cost-saving measures remain in the planning and assessment stage in this Budget. Despite both measures being apparent pivotal planks, the government is relying upon the duck board of their fiscal quagmire. They are both opaque at this point.

However, both raise serious concerns. To begin, I have the following questions on the privatisation agenda: First, how will accessibility and effectiveness of service delivery to Tasmanians in key government services be assessed? Second, how will consideration of equity be incorporated into any proposed changes to key government services? Will the government guarantee that no changes resulting from cost-saving measures will be regressive in their impact on Tasmanians? And third, how will the most disadvantaged Tasmanians be protected from loss of accessibility or affordability in key government services?

Mr Eslake's first report of his two reports commissioned by the government, which was released in April this year, is the initial assessment of potential government business divestment. It provides interesting food for thought. While now is not the time to go into that report in too much detail, it is worthwhile considering the following statement from this initial assessment report of potential GBE sales:

… Debt repayment as a primary motivation for privatisation is likely to be met with heightened public scepticism…

That underscores the importance of putting stronger 'guardrails' around the formulation of budgets and the management of public finances … in order to provide the public with greater assurance that the 'family silver' isn't being sold off, only for the same imprudent financial management which led to the debt problems (which privatisation is intended to solve) subsequently to emerge again.

Again, this state highlights the myriad of implications of this proposed budgetary corrective measure. It casts in sharp relief the need for strong fiscal guardrails for our community and that we consciously avoid financial decisions which erode our fiscal robustness and potential capacity to absorb future economic shocks.

We already know the state is constrained when it comes to creating new diverse revenue streams. Hence, we need to act with clear foresight and a plan should we start to go down a privatisation road that further limits and restricts potential revenue streams. Of equal importance is the need to recognise and own that there are state-owned companies which will not make a profit, but which provide critical services to our community.

An example of this would be Metro Tasmania. I would like to see greater recognition to the fact that reliable, affordable, effective and safe public transport is an essential service for Tasmanians. We saw the Premier proudly declare that Hydro Tasmania was excluded from divestment consideration as it is a sacred cow. All well and good, and while I am sure there are many other significant service providers we could add to a veritable herd of sacred cows, there are some, such as Metro, where the national evidence tells us the only way private providers earn a profit is by cutting services or pricing them out of the reach of those who need and rely upon those services.

Further, the lack of reliable and fair access to such services has very real social, health and environmental costs. Lack of reliable and fair public transport has been shown nationally and globally to entrench disparities in social inclusion and mobility and health equity. Public transportation barriers have serious implications for engagement in education, training, employment and other cultural and economic activities. And further, a modern and zero-carbon public transportation system should be actively contributing to our climate resilience and our climate justice goals.

Time constraints prevent me from going on in too much detail here, but to put it very simply, a strategic approach would regard such a zero-carbon public transport system as a state asset actively working to lower individual transportation costs while contributing to the state's social inclusion, health and climate ledger. That would require the government to climb out of the ideological comfort zone to view these assets not just as short-term profit or loss in the pecuniary sense, but to also apply a robust social, climate and environmental intergenerational lens across them to have some vision to offer both hope and leadership, something we are seeing sadly lacking.

Just as privatisation of assets can risk eroding and making more brittle our financial framework, so too does the spectre of further public sector cuts.

The second predictable ideological comfort zone is this: of the non-imaginative further public sector cuts. The concerning lack of imagination is not just about the lack of effort to identify and explore alternative fiscal corrective mechanisms, but the lack of imagination, curiosity or empathy for how these proposed cuts of an estimated 2500 state employees will affect our fellow Tasmanians.

We have the Treasurer announcing an efficiency and productivity unit, to help assess whether we have, and I quote, 'a public service that is the right size, the right shape, in the right place and equipped with the right tools and resources'. Quite frankly, that is utter trite and insulting nonsense. How do we know that our current public sector is not the right size? What if, in fact, it is currently too small to meet its statutory obligations and the service needs of our fellow Tasmanians?

Where is the analysis, the consultation and the substance behind that ham-fisted rhetoric? It is not there. Why would this government want to risk being able to trot out a favourite scapegoat, which the public sector is invariably regarded as by this government, to carry the can for the fiscal mismanagement of the government's own making?

I can tell you what else is not there: any reference to the independent review of the Tasmanian State Service commissioned by this Liberal government in 2019 and undertaken by Dr Ian Watt AC, who provided the final report in 2021. The purpose of the Watt Independent Review was:

…to consider whether the governing framework of the State Service is fit for purpose for Tasmania today and into the future. The Review set out to identify structural, legislative and administrative improvements that will transform current structures, services and practices to deliver a more efficient and effective public service.

Less jingoistic than the current government's chant, but pretty much stating a similar intent. For members who may not be aware, the government supports, apparently, or at least in principle, all 77 recommendations of the Watt Review. The most recently available update of October last year indicates that 15 recommendations were completed, with another 20 underway, leaving another 42 yet to be brought into effect.

The indicated stage 3 for delivery of all recommendations is the period of June 2025 to June 2026, coinciding with these state budget papers. The budget papers are silent on the Watt Review. Instead, as detailed in budget paper 1, we have a so-called, and Orwellian-sounding, Efficiency and Productivity Unit.

This appears as a bit of a rinse and repeat, as we already saw with the efficiency units and the red tape audit re-announcements made during the Premier's March State of the State speech this year. I am sure not everyone agreed with the recommendations of the Watt Review, but at least that was a transparent process into which input could be made and established criteria used to assess its findings. We are not provided thus far with such criteria, input or transparency for the public sector Efficiency and Productivity Unit. While there are always options for periodic renewal and new ways of delivering services more effectively and efficiently, this is not what these budget papers are about.

It is critical to acknowledge that Tasmanian State Service capacity and resourcing has been weakened and eroded consistently over the years. As we have heard many workers and union representatives state, 'There is no fat left.' We are now at risk of cutting into muscle and into bone. Supposedly, that was one of the remedial tasks of the Watt Review, to address those capacity and delivery deficits.

When considering this latest attack on our public sector system, many serious implications and questions are raised, including the following: first, with the budget papers indicating that the number of general government FTEs will be reduced by 7.2 per cent by 2032-33, how will positions to go be identified?

Second, what assessment is being undertaken of the potential impact of fewer people doing more upon statutory obligations that certain areas of the state sector are legally bound to meet? For example: RTI officers are required to meet legislated time frames when considering assessed disclosure applications and internal reviews. We know there are more stringent child safety mandatory reporting requirements by law coming in. That is not just about a one-way reporting street. Those reports then require assessing and potentially further action. These are only a couple of examples. Suffice to say, it would be a highly irresponsible and reckless government that knowingly places state servants in a position where they are unable to comply with their legislative requirements. Any accidental slippage of compliance is concerning, but when the government deprives workers of the means by which to comply in a consistent and rigorous manner, it is in fact a dereliction of duty.

Then of course, the other area of enormous concern is the impact of reduced services upon Tasmanians across many walks of life. I have touched on the importance of reliable and affordable public transport services already, in the context of the flagged privatisation agenda. However, other critical and essential services such as affordable and secure housing, health, education and a range of necessary support services for vulnerable Tasmanians, whether to address cost of living or other pressures, are also feeling on shaky ground in light of these budget papers and the forward estimates forecast.

We know, courtesy of decades of research, comparative analysis and longitudinal data, that short-term fiscal corrective measures such as budget cuts to services result in long-term socio-economic costs, real human costs in fact, including reduced human and social capital, growing inequality and decreasing civil engagement, a more divided community with those experiencing disadvantage doing so at a disproportionately high degree.

It is high time for the government to recognise that state sector services provide the backbone of any community's social infrastructure while also promoting social equity and inclusion, economic stability, a healthy environment and overall wellbeing. While it is heartening to hear public statements by both the Treasurer and the Premier along the lines that this government is not slashing and burning the public sector as they want to ensure services continue to be provided, the serious problem is they have failed to provide a coherent and trustworthy plan to avoid future budgets resorting to slash and burn in light of the escalating debt. By failing to provide such a coherent and considered plan, Tasmanians are deeply concerned that the axe may fall even more savagely across more critical services, if not this financial year, then possibly the next or the one after that.

Another critical area lacking the desperately needed government leadership is reconciliation with our Tasmanian Aboriginal community. I have said numerous times previously in this place and I will continue to repeat that the portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs should be held by the premier of the day. That is where the whole-of-government and integrated approach stems, fundamentally crucial for meaningful and effective reconciliation efforts. Yet again, we see a lack of vision, a lack of determination and a lack of a plan. In fact, the plan is going backwards, as we heard last week when the Warner and McCormack-recommended pathway to treaty is now inexplicably put on hold. While I recognise the significant truth-telling component is set to continue, which is welcome, it is disappointing that the government has not reiterated its intention to still pursue a treaty, maybe following that truth-telling process.

I do wish to acknowledge the emphasis placed on Tasmania needing to do more to 'close the gap' in these budget papers; that is welcome, but also it is long overdue, and it comes off a base in which we are failing miserably to close those gaps. I also think it is a constructive step forward to see the Aboriginal Land Council allocated $200,000 for the 2025-26 financial year and annually across the forward Estimates. Many of us here are aware how lack of adequate resourcing of the Land Council meant that it was struggling to comply with administrative and other management requirements, and hopefully being able to plan around this additional funding will provide much-needed breathing space and room for capacity-building.

Unfortunately, however, the same cannot be said about the government's support for another vital organisation, Reconciliation Tasmania. While there is a small bump in funding for Reconciliation Tasmania presented in this Budget, it falls far short of the peak body funding that was requested to ensure RecTas can do its important work, and which is provided by all other state governments in their jurisdictions. It leaves Reconciliation Tasmania with future uncertainty which may well hamstring its ability to play a meaningful role in supporting our state to meet Closing the Gap targets. 

I recognise, Mr President, as did you, the Premier attended the wonderful Reconciliation Week breakfast function that was hosted by Reconciliation Tasmania just yesterday. However, there is ongoing lack of secure, meaningful and practical support over the forward Estimates by the government to be investing in the capacity of organisations such as Reconciliation Tasmania, which are working to deliver tangibles on the ground.

Given our current poor progress on the Closing the Gap targets, where we are behind on 17 of the 19 targets according to the last report provided, we can do with all the help we can get on this front.

One last point I wish to make on this topic is to again highlight the disappointing, deafening silence on the provision of future land handbacks to the Tasmanian Aboriginal community. We have not seen this paramount and significant mode of recognition of the oldest living culture on this planet, the returning of non-ceded lands, since 2005 with the return of Cape Barren and Clarke islands. Inaction of 20 years, though I do recognise there were more recent attempts made during the Labor-Greens government, just over a decade ago. More clear planning and effort is thoroughly lacking and is failing to occur under this government that has been in power these past 11 years.

I have spoken on a range of matters relating to the crisis of leadership from this government and cannot move on from that topic without mentioning the looming spectre over this Budget, of the AFL-demanded stadium at Mac Point. Fundamentally, the debacle surrounding the Mac Point stadium is catastrophic failure of leadership. It is a failure that has cruelly cleaved our Tasmanian community, causing a level of distress and division I have not seen on any other issue. Today, I will not be veering into discussion of the merits or otherwise of the AFL-demanded stadium at that site. That is a debate for another day. What this issue illustrates in sharp relief cannot go without being remarked upon.

My campaign team knocked on around 12,000 doors in Nelson this year. I can say categorically the issue raised unprompted at the doors most frequently was the AFL-demanded stadium at Mac Point. Let me say clearly, by a massive order of magnitude, the views expressed at the doors of Nelson were against the proposed Mac Point stadium.

However, the views expressed were not simplistic nor jingoistic and were certainly not uncomplicated. By and large, they were thoughtful, and they were pained. Virtually in every instance, they saw the government's mismanagement of the AFL team and the AFL-demanded stadium issue as emblematic of a government that has lost its way, that lacks leadership to make good decisions and, most sadly, a government that is bullheadedly refusing to listen to the Tasmanian community.

They commented with dismay on the apparent determination of the Premier and his government to drive division in the Tasmanian people, with aggressive language and false equivalencies. The people of Nelson were astounded to observe such irresponsible and damaging behaviour and rhetoric from a premier who, on this topic of a Tasmanian AFL team, had the opportunity to provide our state with the most unifying and positive realisation of a shared dream. Instead, the Premier has turned that dream into a destructive nightmare and, in doing so, has sole responsibility for putting our longed-for Tasmanian team at risk.

No doubt much more will be said on this topic in later debate, for now to other topics relating to the Budget.
My passion for a strong, accountable democracy in this state is well known. Naturally, something I was keen to scrutinise in these budget papers was the funding provided to our important statutory oversight bodies and whether it may finally be provided at levels that even come close to sufficient for them to do their statutory roles. Tasmanians would be excused for thinking that starving our independent statutory oversight bodies of resources is an actual government savings program in these budget papers.

Let us start by having a look at the Integrity Commission. Despite the then-chief commissioner, Mr Greg Melick, stating in response to last year's Budget, in only September last year, and I quote:

The marginal increase to our funds in the 2024-25 Budget does not meet our needs. If we are to fulfil our statutory obligations and meet community expectations, our resourcing needs cannot be neglected. We call on the parliament to properly resource and empower us to be the Integrity Commission Tasmanians deserve.

Well, didn't that fall on deaf ears from this government? Even that marginal increase provided in last year's budget is eroded in the papers before us. We see our Integrity Commission in this state doomed to remain the nation's lowest-funded independent integrity entity. That is despite the fact that on 1 July, the new lobbyist oversight regime is scheduled to commence: another task that will need to be undertaken by the Integrity Commission. It will require further of the Integrity Commission's resources and staff to administer it, to provide education and training and so on. That is on top of the considerable load they are already carrying in terms of their statutory responsibilities.

This deliberate and continual starvation of an independent statutory oversight and integrity entity by this government is appalling. It is unconscionable and members of this government should hang their heads in shame over it. It is telling, when a government persistently and deliberately underfunds the integrity entity that is supposed to deliver oversight in this state and yet, when questioned about it, we hear this government try to put up the paltry defence that since more than a decade ago there has been some increase in funding to that entity. What a crock. Quite frankly, what a crock.

We have known for years that our Integrity Commission does not have the funds it needs to do its statutory job under law. We also know that this Integrity Commission is hampered in doing its job because of the absolute delay and dereliction of this government in delivering the reforms identified under the Cox Review from 2016. Nine years ago, the Cox Review was, and yet we have the Premier in the other place saying just the other day that they will be delighted to give us an update in September on delivering the remaining recommendations from that Cox Review. Well, quite frankly, that is nine-and-a-half years too late.

There were 55 recommendations from the Cox Review: about six of them are implemented. The Integrity Commission has said time and again it is hampered in doing its role. It is literally being held up in current investigations because of the matters that should be dealt with by those recommended reforms, and yet the government has persistently delayed in doing them. That is a deliberate decision, and to point ahead still yet six months further down the track from now to an update on delivering those recommended reforms is offensive.

This is a government that does not want to be held to account on integrity. There is no other way we can interpret this behaviour from the government and the absolute offensive level of funding provided in this Budget to the Integrity Commission of Tasmania, no other way.

Moving on to the Ombudsman and its associated hats of the Custodial Inspector and the Tasmanian National Preventive Mechanism, the TNPM, Chapter 21 of budget paper 2 and volume 2 rolls all three together. To save time I will also refer to all three now. Again, these papers reveal a woeful, shabby story. The minor budgetary bump provided to the Office of the Ombudsman for the 2025-26 financial year then dissipates over the forward estimates, and despite the ongoing recognition that the office has been under-resourced for years, we see this continuing trend.

The TNPM received a measly additional $250,000 in the 2025-26 and 2026-27 years, and then nothing for the remaining forward estimates, where presumably it will be reduced to last year's budget allocation of $300,000. You will recall, that when it was given $300,000 in last year's Budget, it was identified that that was sufficient to put a position in place of the Tasmanian NPM, which would then not be able to undertake any of its statutory roles, which are the visits to places of detention, or places where people have had their liberty taken. To fund an entity, to have on paper someone in a role, sitting at a desk, but actually not funded to do the oversight job it statutorily is required to do is an absolute joke; but it is not at all funny. It is disgraceful.

Wearing his TNPM hat, Mr Richard Connock released a media statement dated 25 November last year calling on the state government to do this:

…commit to effective independent monitoring and oversight to protect hundreds of vulnerable people around the state that are being denied their rights under Tasmanian law, and who are at risk of poor-quality treatment.

Mr Connock then provided a detailed budget breakdown of what was required for the TNPM to fully comply with its legislated responsibilities under the Tasmanian OPCAT Implementation Act 2021, as well as its accepted commission of inquiry and Disability Royal Commission recommendations, and he stated that $4.2 million was necessary for the TNPM to fully perform its functions.

The $500,000 for two years is a long way short of the identified $4 million considered necessary to comply with state legislation and deliver the commission of inquiry sets of recommendations. Tasmanians have a right to expect these independent statutory offices to be able to fulfil all their functions all of the time, yet the government is deliberately hamstringing their capacity via resource starvation. Again, this is a deliberate choice. This is a government which is happy to crow about being the laudable first movers in our nation to put our OPCAT act into effect. That was a celebrated day, when we took the lead on doing that, and yet now, ever since, they have done nothing but undercut the actual implementation, actual activity that role is meant to undertake under the act.

On a slightly positive note, I do want to acknowledge that it is heartening to see the proposed parliamentary budget office received the recognition it merits. Presuming it comes to fruition, this initiative should add to the robust policy debate occurring in this parliament. However, yet again, it is actually just another process that has been announced here. We have yet to see the rubber hit the road and if we can pessimistically go on past practice, it will be a tragedy if we see a parliamentary budget office established, only to be so significantly underfunded that it cannot deliver on the functions it is designed to provide.

It would seem an odd omission if I failed to mention here the minimal increase provided for all upper House members detailed in budget paper 2, volume 2. This is a formalisation of the process - for want of a better word - instigated by the Premier just prior to last year's budget Estimates scrutiny hearings, when he wrote to all upper House members offering additional 0.5 of an FTE staffer, bringing individual total staffing resources to 1.5 FTEs. I asked at the time why MLCs, particularly independent MLCs, were not resourced in a manner equitable to the independent crossbench members of the other place who receive 2.5 FTEs. Why are we not resourced equitably in this place?

Why should our staff not receive the same workplace safety considerations offered by colleagues on site, particularly in regional electorate offices, or professional development opportunities facilitated in a team environment, as apparently exist in other MPs' offices? Why should elected representatives of single-member electorates, such that we are, not receive the same degree of resourcing by which to serve our electorate, as MPs who share their electorates with six other MPs? I have yet to receive satisfactory answers to these questions. While I welcome the acknowledgement made by these budget papers that resourcing of legislative councillors is inequitable to the resourcing of the Assembly MPs, I reiterate on the public record this token provision does little to address that inexplicable inequity.

A key issue I look for in budget papers, because of my background before coming to this place, is the degree to which we are investing in a resilient community via supporting our community services sector. If I just mention briefly here, unfortunately I was not able to go to the TasCOSS budget briefing last Friday morning because it happened to coincide with the declaration of the polls for Nelson. I did receive the material provided by TasCOSS at that briefing and it is incredibly concerning to note at a time that we see many metrics of community wellbeing and social cohesion going southward, when we are talking about cuts to public services, fundamental supports to the Tasmanian community, we are also seeing a community services sector that is being insufficiently supported and funded, and continuing to be subject to the insecurity and the uncertainty of their funding environment.

We know that the community services sector in Tasmania presents budget submissions every year. There are very fundamental, straightforward things that they request in those budget submissions. Quite frankly, typically the amounts being requested through the Budget are very modest when we look at them in the big scheme of things. Some of the things that the industry had identified as being absolutely important to be delivered in this Budget included funding certainty and five-year contracts with appropriate indexation and outcomes-based frameworks applied to them. They identified that a sustainability program was needed, with standard contracts, reduced reporting, streamlined processes and shared services. They looked to a 10-year update for the state of Tasmania's community services sector report, and hope to see a mid-term review funded of the Community Services Industry Plan 2021-2031.

Unfortunately, the community services sector has been let down once again. The fact that occurs virtually every year in this state should never inure us to the real-life impact that it has out there in the community, because this is a sector that we look to, to support our most vulnerable and to tenaciously and committedly keep showing up when people need them most. Yet, every year, we undersell, we under-support this sector, and this year we have seen the same.
What we have seen, which is a positive piece of progress, is that we are commencing stage one of the transition to longer-term five-year funding arrangements. That is welcome, but we have not had confirmed that appropriate indexation is going to be applied in those circumstances. So, we do not have the full package of that yet, and we do not know exactly how that is going to be delivered. We have seen a commitment to $150,000, I believe, for a community services sustainability initiative. That is a pittance and will deliver a very limited outcome. It certainly does not come anywhere close to delivering on those asks that I just ran through previously, that were made by the sector in their budget submission through TasCOSS. It is a shocking lack of support.

There is some window dressing. We know that all governments of any stripe love to support Neighbourhood Houses and will typically make some nice, appealing-looking announcements about funding in that space - which is always welcome, which will always go some way to providing something through those excellent institutions in our neighbourhoods, which are typically our most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. It is not that we are going to turn up our nose and say no to that funding, but that is window-dressing funding. We still have far too many community sector organisations - many of which I have been in contact with in the most recent months - which are facing a completely uncertain funding future past 30 June this year. At that time, of course what that meant was they were losing staff because when you cannot tell staff at the beginning of May whether they are going to have a job at the end of June, they have to start looking for other opportunities, and organisations have to start winding up programs if they do not know whether they can continue past 30 June.

This is a government that is leaving these organisations in these positions far too often. It is disgraceful. It trades on the dedication and the goodwill and the good faith of the people who work in this sector and the people who lead this sector. That is quite disgraceful.

A key component of the annual state budget papers, which I look forward to considering, is the Gender Budget Statement. The 2025-26 Gender Budget Statement is the fourth such document and it has come a long way since the inaugural statement produced by the Liberal government in 2022, following this place voting in support of my two motions calling for this initiative, which went through this place in early 2020 and [Bookmark: Phr3_O=33.4_D=1.0_C=0.31]  2021.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=35.2_D=26.5_C=0.88] In contrast to that initial 2022 gender budget statement, which was basically just a shopping list of female-oriented funding line-items, successive statements since then have slowly developed a series of indicators and made attempts to provide data collation and analysis of policies which may impact upon women and girls, as well as provide comparative statistics across genders. This has been a welcome progress over time.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=62.5_D=2.8_C=0.86] The current 2025-26 Gender Budget Statement [Bookmark: Phr6_O=65.6_D=28.4_C=0.87]  does continue this trajectory from its basic beginning to now providing a broader range of policy targets and analysis. However, further work is still required for this to become as useful a policy analysis tool as it could and should be, particularly in the area of developing more meaningful indicators. For example, a gender budget assessment statement should continue to provide informative and current data that helps us monitor indicators which are intended to assess gender-based statistics [Bookmark: Phr7_O=94.3_D=13.7_C=0.76]  such as women on boards and addressing the gender pay gap. Additionally, it should also be presenting a developed and nuanced lens by which apparent non-gendered policies are in fact impacting and behaving in a gendered or intersectional manner. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=108.7_D=12.3_C=0.83]  For example, the current Gender Budget Statement provides an analysis of the 2025-26 Budget initiatives, including half-price fares. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=121.8_D=16.4_C=0.79]  It states:

Census data indicate that a greater proportion of Tasmanian women use public transport compared with men.

If this is still the case, it would suggest that half-price fares may disproportionately benefit women as the greater users of public transport. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=138.5_D=29.9_C=0.83]  However, given the limited data, this cannot be conclusively stated. It is a shame that there is limited data on the gender of Tasmanian public transport users, as this could be an example of how an effectively designed and produced gender budget assessment becomes a crucial component of a good public policy toolkit, not just how well it tracks delivery of specific gendered policy and resourcing, such as breast diagnostic facilities, for example, but also to test for a gendered landing of [Bookmark: Phr11_O=168.9_D=25.5_C=0.74]  apparent gender-neutral policies such as providing the half-price fares on public transport. In light of my earlier discussion of Metro Tasmania as one of the state-owned companies under consideration for potential divestment, I would argue that a strong gender lens must be cast across any assets proposed for privatisation as well as any public sector jobs or service cuts.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=196.1_D=4.6_C=0.75] In conclusion on the Gender Budget Statement,  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=201.6_D=20.5_C=0.88] I would congratulate the government for the continuing progress being made on that as a tool and I look forward to that continuing in future budget years and it becoming even more valuable to us. I am really happy to see this has come to fruition from the advocacy that I brought to this place early on in my first term.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=223.4_D=10.9_C=0.88] Before I conclude, I want to touch on climate change and climate justice as absolutely crucial matters that should be discussed in relation to any budget. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=235.9_D=24.9_C=0.86]  We know the current climate change action plan spans 2023 to 2025, but clearly we cannot be reducing our focus or our efforts. This is so fundamental to building a resilient community, to addressing the cost of living, food insecurity, affordable heating and cooling of homes, hospitals, businesses, et cetera. It goes to the heart of our transport planning, or at least should [Bookmark: Phr16_O=261.8_D=30.0_C=0.85] , let alone protecting our unique biodiversity, our freshwater sources and our marine waterways. Yet the climate change output in Volume 1 No. 2 appears to receive a small increase for the 2025-26 financial year, up to $9.5 million, but then it plunges back down to around $2.7 million across the forward estimates. I doubt we will have solved the climate challenge by July 2026, so this does appear somewhat shortsighted. 

The OECD has called [Bookmark: Phr17_O=291.8_D=13.2_C=0.71]  governments to develop instruments for integrating the impact of climate change and green objectives into budgetary discussions and decisions. The OECD described these instruments as:

Green budgeting uses budget policymaking tools to integrate climate and environmental perspectives into budget frameworks and practices, to better inform budget decisions. Green budgeting is relevant to all stages in the budget cycle, specifically budget planning, formulation, approval, implementation and oversight.

There are clearly some similarities in how gender and climate change should be incorporated into our public policy assessment toolkit. The Tasmanian government should begin to swiftly develop a climate budget lens and framework, as urged by the OECD, to begin to drive an integrated and coherent climate budgetary process. That is one for continued advocacy in this place I hope to contribute to.

There are many aspects of this state budget I am not going to analyse in detail today. I have kept it high level on some key areas I feel are crucial. As this is such a woefully bad budget for our state, with such a dismal outlook we cannot but focus on the issues of leadership and those overarching principles this government is failing to apply.

In conclusion, given the dereliction of our state's financial circumstances and the daunting magnitude of the challenges our Tasmanian community faces, we need here a state government that is better than average, that is exemplary.

Unfortunately, what we have is a state government that, in this Budget, has confirmed yet again that it falls far, far short of even basic competence, capacity and leadership. This Budget does not and cannot build a better Tasmania, certainly not for Tasmanians who are struggling the most. This B budget is not a sensible pathway to anything, let alone a surplus.

This government has put us in a deep hole, and they are still digging with this Budget. This government, in this Budget, has done nothing to remedy our increasingly dire financial situation. That situation is entirely due to policy decisions across the 11 long years this government has been in power in this state.

This is a compounding trajectory and one which risks eroding the capacity for both the state and Tasmanians to absorb future shocks. Yet it would seem this government hopes to distract Tasmanians from the looming black hole of the ever-increasing debt burden across the future budgets that are ahead of us, with misleading spin and the dopamine decoy of short-term sugar hits.

Of equal concern is the lack of a plan to address the growing debt reflected in this 2025-26 Budget and across the forward estimates. This inevitably foreshadows a more deeply divided and less equitable Tasmania in the future.

I reiterate my call for the government to genuinely tackle the structural reform of Tasmania's financial framework that is desperately needed and a decade overdue. By doing so, I put this government on notice. It will be unacceptable for this government to saddle Tasmanians with significant non-strategic debt, in the main, without a substantial plan to get back into the black, and then to turn around and say, 'Oh, given the concerns over debt, we have no choice but to cut services even further, to cut even more public sector jobs and to sell off at a bargain basement rate even more of our state-owned assets.' This government has been warned, that will not be acceptable in this place or to the Tasmanian people. There are alternative and responsible approaches to the trajectory we are seeing at risk of compounding from this state budget, across the forward estimates.

There is an opportunity now to drive business, public sector and community momentum in a constructive manner towards real, equitable, fair and sustainable reform. The people of Nelson and all Tasmanians deserve a sound, fair and robust fiscal framework which invests in an inclusive Tasmania, now and for the future.

Sadly, this 2025-26 state Budget does not and cannot deliver that.

I sadly note this Budget.

[12.20 p.m.]
Ms THOMAS (Elwick) - Madam Deputy President, I rise to note the 2025-26 Budget. Following on from the member for Nelson's very thorough contribution, I note a few things I also was planning on speaking about that the member for Nelson has covered quite adequately. One is the issue with funding to the community sector: I entirely agree with your comments and have received feedback from organisations in the community sector who are feeling left behind by this government, as I quite clearly articulated last week in my response to the state of the state address.

The member for Nelson also mentioned the issue of parity and resourcing and, certainly, I am feeling that more than ever over the last few weeks, with the pressure being placed by this government on members in relation to scrutinising the budget, the stadium and all the consultation documents put out in relation to the stadium. We have a youth justice bill they are trying to rush through this week. All these significant pieces of legislation have significant impact for Tasmania that we, particularly as independents in this place, have very little resources to be able to scrutinise and analyse and do our jobs properly.

So, whilst yes, it is a positive there is some additional funding in the Budget to assist with that, it does not go anywhere near providing parity with members in the House of Assembly and we do exactly the same job. I note the comments from the member for Nelson in relation to the parliamentary budget office. I, too, was going to touch on this, that yes, fantastic, there is $100,000 in the Budget, signalling the government is interested in the establishment of a parliamentary budget office and receptive to that idea.

This is not a new idea. This is something the Public Accounts Committee has recently been investigating and done a lot of work on already. I am interested to see what that $100,000 is proposed to be used on. Hopefully, not a consultancy, with the Public Accounts Committee already well underway with the work to investigate what the options are and what the best practice model might be.

I also note the member for Nelson's comments in relation to the National Preventive Mechanism and there being not sufficient funding to enable us as a state to properly comply with our obligations under OPCAT and for all of these oversight bodies. We have spent a lot of time over the last 12 months introducing new oversight bodies and legislation for oversight bodies to ensure vulnerable people in our community are safe and supported. It is so important those resources are provided so legislation we have passed can be properly implemented.

I will move on. I do thank the member for Nelson for her thorough contribution, and other members. I have really enjoyed listening to other members' contributions and I learn a lot from listening to other members and enjoy hearing different perspectives. Being just my second budget reply, I went to the Standing Orders to remind myself of the rules and procedure relating to the budget. I thought I would make note of this in my contribution for all of those people watching along on the livestream or reading the Hansard who may not know why this is done a bit differently to any other bill. I reminded myself that it is under part 28, our special provisions relating to bills that the Council may not amend; 307 budget debate, 307(1) says:

After the tabling of budget papers and prior to receipt of the appropriation Bill from the Assembly, the principle of such Bill shall be debated by means of a 'take note' motion.

And 307(2) says:

Following the first reading of the appropriation Bill and provided the 'take note' motion has been agreed to, the President shall put the question without amendment and without debate, 'That the Bill be now read the second time'.

So, here we are under 307, debating the 'take note' motion. I recall last year, in my budget reply, I presented my thoughts as a compliment sandwich trying to insert some positivity and optimism, understanding it is not easy to balance the books and deliver for everyone.

I really would have liked to do the same this year; however, sadly I could not find much good to put in the middle of that sandwich. Other members, particularly the member for Murchison, also the member for Huon, have clearly articulated the dire situation the numbers present and the government's blatant disregard for the advice and possible solutions presented by respected economists and others. I will not speak in detail on those points, but what I will put on the record is that I am extremely disappointed in this Budget.

I am despairing at the dire financial position this state is in. I am extremely disappointed in this government's apparent lack of willingness to take advice and work together with experts and other members of parliament on solutions to this financial crisis we are in. I am extremely disappointed in the prioritisation of the top end of town in this Budget, and prioritisation of big 
business and elite and commercialised sport over our community sector, grassroots clubs and everyday battlers. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=13.9_D=18.8_C=0.80]  This Budget simply does not reflect the priorities of Tasmanians. The member for Huon nailed it when he said:

We are going backwards into more debt and deficit. All that will do is load our children and grandchildren with an unfair start to their working life because we as a state could not manage money. This is not a responsible proposition.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=34.6_D=10.2_C=0.74] I wholeheartedly agree. This is not what Tasmanians want for future generations. To a large extent, Tasmanians do not care too much about the colour of the government. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=45.6_D=3.6_C=0.86]  The results of the 2024 state election demonstrate this. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=49.4_D=25.8_C=0.81]  What Tasmanians care about is having elected members who will listen, elected members who will act and make decisions with the interests of everyday people and the state more broadly at heart. Regardless of political party affiliation, Tasmanians rightly expect their members of parliament to work together to serve their best interests. Nothing angers people more than decisions made to serve political interest. The member for Rumney said of [Bookmark: Phr6_O=75.4_D=3.7_C=0.81]  the process by which we scrutinise the Budget:

… the process is a little backward. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=79.5_D=13.4_C=0.83]  We do this now, but without really having had the opportunity to properly scrutinise the Budget through our Estimates process.

… There is no doubt many of us would have a lot more to say if we were to do that first and maybe that is why we do it this way. 

Ms Rattray - Through you Madam Deputy President, it has been suggested that might be the reason why. We would have too much to say.

Ms THOMAS -  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=100.0_D=9.2_C=0.72] We probably would. I agree, having had just four to five days to trawl through hundreds of pages of budget papers, it is difficult to deliver a reply. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=109.8_D=26.2_C=0.79]  I am not complaining, just saying how it is. I do like to be solution-focused and I was interested to hear the member for Huon's remarks when he noted that the Constitution Act 1934 provides that the Legislative Council may return a money bill to the House of Assembly requesting amendment of the bill. The member for Huon suggested it may be a bit too sudden to take advantage of that provision and send the Budget back this year, but if the provision exists, perhaps it is something we ought to explore further.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=137.0_D=4.8_C=0.70] I was also interested to hear your comments, Madam Deputy President [Bookmark: Phr12_O=142.7_D=7.9_C=0.80] , that for the first time in 20 years, you are asking yourself whether you could, in all good conscience, actually support this Budget as the member for Murchison.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=151.8_D=14.5_C=0.82] I note your comments and I know that you have worked very hard to understand the budget over your 20 years in this place, and when the member for Murchison is so alarmed that she is not sure whether she can support the Budget that is presented, I suggest the government ought to stand up and listen. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=167.2_D=29.9_C=0.80]  In fact, they should have stood up and listened before now. The member for Murchison has been conveying significant concern about the budget and the financial situation of Tasmania for some time, as have other members of parliament. There have been solutions suggested. There have been goodwill offers of wanting to work together to find solutions, as Tasmanians rightly expect us to do. Instead, the government ploughs on, seemingly forgetting they are leading in minority, that they do not have a mandate, that they do need to work together with all other members of parliament to deliver for Tasmanians. 

The government is ignoring the richness and diversity of our collective intelligence in this and the other place, what the 50 of us could achieve working together. As mayor of Glenorchy City Council, my number one priority was bringing elected members together on the journey informing our budget and in any decision-making for that matter, because cohesion and collaboration is critical if you are to govern effectively and serve the best interests of the people who elect you.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=227.2_D=29.0_C=0.84] Our budget process at council involved a series of workshops beginning in around October and going through until June. Everyone came together to discuss priorities and ideas, informed by the advice of departments of council. We also engaged with the community asking about its priorities to help inform our decision-making. Now, I am not saying this process was perfect, or that people were always happy with the outcomes, but they had the opportunity to engage and have input - elected members and the community - well before the budget landed.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=256.9_D=2.1_C=0.94] Why can we not do something similar in here [Bookmark: Phr18_O=259.7_D=7.4_C=0.73] , even if with 50 members it is too unwieldy to put through a process like this, what about a budget committee? [Bookmark: Phr19_O=268.8_D=6.7_C=0.83]  We know the current process is not working. It is not satisfactory to most non-government members. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=276.7_D=28.3_C=0.79]  We are rushed in delivering a budget reply and then next week government administration committees will spend hundreds of hours collectively scrutinising the Budget, line by line, questioning ministers for some answers to explain things that are not clear in the numbers or commentary that is presented. This process is also provided for in our Standing Orders under Part 21 - Estimates Committees, 220. Budget papers referred, which says:

When debate has concluded on the Question 'That the budget papers be noted' the budget papers are to be referred to Estimates Committees A and B of the Council. Such Committees may not vote on, but may examine and report upon the proposed expenditures contained in the appropriation bill. Such expenditures shall be considered on an output by output basis, including grants, subsidies and loans and the Capital Investment Program.
This budget estimates process consumes enormous amounts of resources, both during the week next week, in our time, ministers' time, and the time of departmental staff and advisers who support this process. It consumes significant resources of government department staff and advisers, who spend thousands of hours collectively on taxpayer money in preparing huge folders full of information for budget Estimates - putting together information about so many things, answers to questions that will not even be asked.

I have participated in this process as a public servant, putting together question time, Estimates briefs. It is a lot of work taken away that could be actually used for doing other things perhaps better serving Tasmanians - because all for what, this Estimates process? Reports provided that perhaps no-one reads. For better understanding of the budget, perhaps, but certainly no material change to it. It is too late. Why are we not having these conversations before the budget is finalised? Budget workshops, a budget committee? Let's do things differently, get better outcomes for Tasmanians.

However, it is what it is this year. Next week in Estimates, I hope the government will be able to explain how it justifies this exorbitant proposed expenditure on high-performance sporting infrastructure to serve an elite few, while thousands of kids miss out or play in substandard facilities with equipment from the 1960s to 1980s. I have repeatedly said, even before I was elected to this place, my support for government investment in high-performance sporting facilities is contingent on the government also equally prioritising investment in grassroots sporting infrastructure. Right now, the numbers show this is not occurring.

This Budget includes $11.5 million for sponsorship deals with Hawthorn, the JackJumpers and Cricket Tasmania, whilst the amount provided to state sporting organisations for community programs has not increased for decades. This Budget includes $105 million for the Devils' high-performance training centre, whilst at the same time, the Tasmania Active Infrastructure Program, which provides funding to grassroots sporting facilities, has been cut from $5 million per year to $2.5 million per year.

There are millions of dollars for elite facilities to be owned or leased for a small buck by commercial sporting entities, whilst at the same time, our Tasmanian Institute of Sport athletes train in makeshift gym facilities located in office administration buildings at Technopark. Our athletes, who are aspiring to represent our state and our country on the international stage at the Olympics, are left behind by this government whilst it dishes out millions to the AFL and NBL. It is simply not right, and it is not fair.

There is no funding in this Budget for much-needed community basketball courts in Hobart, where there is not one community court, and kids will be on the street when Swisherr closes in 12 months' time. It is not even the $5 million the government committed for this purpose leading into the federal election, off the back of the motion supported by this House calling on the government to contribute a share for the Home for Hobart facility in New Town.

Of the 10 community or semi-elite sporting facilities promoted as receiving funding in the government's glossy budget brochure, there is just one in the south - and guess where it is? In Taroona, funnily enough - where this government recently tried very unsuccessfully to buy a Legislative Council seat.

It is time investment decisions were made on evidence-based need, rather than winning votes. It is time our community sporting organisations were prioritised over and above - or at the very least, equally - to elite sport that is run as a business. The fact we know that some kids are missing out on the opportunity to play sport shows the government's priorities are unbalanced, skewed heavily towards investment in elite sport. This is not a budget for Tasmania's children, and they deserve better. I note the Budget.

[12.35 p.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - Mr President, I rise to give my thoughts on the budget papers and Appropriation Bills 1 and 2 of 2025. I would first like to thank all members for their efforts and congratulate the member for Montgomery for his election and the members for Nelson and Pembroke for their re-election. I also greatly appreciate the budget speech contributions from all members, and it is interesting to hear the views of others.

As always, the Budget provides an important opportunity to both understand the priorities of the current government and evaluate the adequacy of its responses to the issues facing Tasmania. Responsible budgetary practices are fundamental to good governance and as the house of review, the Legislative Council has a duty to promote responsible practices, examine government budgetary proposals and voice the concerns of our constituents.

In the past years, the government has painted an optimistic picture of their vision for Tasmania. They have proposed radical change, the role of government enterprise in Tasmania centred on deficit reduction and suggested various proposals which have the possibility to alter the state of Tasmania's finances for years to come.

This Budget is a combination of some of these ideas. For better or worse, the government has fleshed out its ideas on cutting red tape, reducing deficit spending and altering the financial position of Tasmania. I would be remiss not to note though, the Liberal government has scaled back many of its plans and watered down proposals. At times this is not unwelcome, as less radical change often means less risk for Tasmanians. However, it also does not instil confidence in its planning and commitment to paths that will by any means have great impact on Tasmania. Moreover, the ongoing structural reform to government spending that is so necessary is missing from this Budget. The government has continued to spend and failed to implement as much deficit reduction as one would have expected if it were acting responsibly.

I will begin by looking at the positive aspects of the Budget before expressing my concerns. I would like to start by looking at the major commitments by the government to fitness facilities across the state. Credit where credit is due. The commitment of $200 million across the state, including for my electorate and for rural Tasmania, is very welcome. I especially would like to recognise the funding allocated to the north-west, for example, in the electorate of Mersey.

The Tasmanian 2025-26 overview mentions the investment into the multipurpose sports centre at the Devonport Oval, which is an exciting venture for the community and the Devonport City Council. The Port Sorell Bowls and Community Club also receives funding. I know they applied for funding for synthetic bowls green, and external toilets accessible for one and all.

Recently the Premier opened the $220,000 worth of greens at the Latrobe Bowls and Community Club. I can assure you, it is being used constantly by club members, visitors and Latrobe High School students. This will allow the club to thrive over the winter period for social activity, so I am exceptionally excited for the Port Sorell Bowls Club.
Tasmania has a thriving sport culture and fitness is crucial to positive health outcomes and preventive health care. The Valley Road Regional Football Club is the home of the Devonport Strikers, and I must declare an interest here, as I am a patron of the Devonport Strikers and the patron of the Devonport Junior Soccer Association.

It opens this weekend, which is great. Not only are there 141 statewide junior soccer teams competing in Devonport for the Devonport Cup, but the finals of the Lako Cup are being played on Monday. Whilst the men's strikers did not make the final, the women's and men's under-21s have made it to their grand finals in their respective competitions. This is another important outcome of budget spending which prioritises communities as well as preventive health care in the form of fitness.

Additionally, the funding for mental health precincts and continued support of healthcare improvements across the state, including the new Devonport Mental Health Hub, is very welcome. As our population ages and demographics change it is important for Tasmania to have an effective healthcare service and I hope for future investment, support and continued innovation within our healthcare sector.

I made note the last time I spoke on a budget I commented it was gratifying to see additional resources going into the building work, refurbishment and modernisation of the Mersey Community Hospital and its services. I am satisfied and pleased to recognise this work is coming to its completion and to recognise the substantial investment that has been provided in the budget for the health sector.

Ms Forrest - They just have to find the money to pay for the operations of it.

Mr GAFFNEY - Yes. Guy Barnett MP stated in his budget speech the Budget will provide an extra $942 million to meet increased demand for health and mental health services. I hope that this investment will work to address some of the strain on our hospital services.

It is obvious the health sector is one which will put to good use every dollar which goes its way. I am certain that funding towards elective surgeries and maintained funding for mental health care is very welcome. Additionally, access to health care from pharmacists is important and reduces the barrier for Tasmanians accessing health care. Various other positive initiatives have also received funding: nearly $10 billion invested into education, children and young people over four years is admirable and a future-facing investment; funding for items such as healthy lunch programs; money to progress Closing the Gap; funding for new schools and school improvements; free working with vulnerable people cards; a volunteering strategy; and other such programs.

I note at this point: three of the five priorities listed by Volunteering Tasmania have not been funded, despite a more difficult situation for volunteers and volunteering organisations than ever before. Many of the smaller social initiatives, some of which have received funding, do not eat unduly into the Budget, yet provide benefit to those Tasmanians who need support the most. Are you all right, Mr President?

Mr PRESIDENT – Yes. I just sneezed.

Mr GAFFNEY - Okay. I just want that recorded on Hansard. Some more expensive initiatives are equally important, such as promoting housing for young people and record investment in education. Indeed, the ongoing school building blitz will provide upgrades to education across Tasmania, including the North West Support School, Devonport campus, of course. Various other investments across the division of Braddon are very welcome.

However, I also have some key concerns regarding the proposed spending in the Budget. When I last spoke to the previous budget, I raised my concerns regarding health care, lack of investment into promoting a positive gender role for both men and women, and the needs of improving educational outcomes. I also mentioned the real threat which increasing the cost of borrowing provides. In this address, I must recognise a more fundamental critique of the Budget. Frankly, the government is not doing enough to address the unfortunate habit of governmental overspending and is continuing our legacy of deficit spending, which it is not elected to do so.

This is not responsible spending and at this rate, as we have heard and has been suggested, we are on track to be spending $650 million annually just to service our state's debt. Turning to the budget Estimates themselves, I have serious concerns. Frankly, it seems we continue to spend a lot of money for not much benefit; moreover, the numbers are somewhat misleading. For instance, the Budget itself notes an estimate of over $10 billion by the 2028-29 financial year, which does not include the net debt of government business enterprises or GBEs, though I must note, as I will elaborate on later, I do not believe the solution is the sale of these GBEs.

While unemployment is low and the operating deficit is estimated to reduce in the coming years, I have concerns, as do many others who have financial and economic expertise, about the likelihood of the level of debt reduction estimated by the government. Additionally, cuts to government services, privatisation and austerity spending comes with your own cost, both financially and the quality of services which are relied on by many Tasmanians, and it is important to get this right.

I question the decision-making of the government in giving priority to some areas of spending, wasting state finances with bungled major projects such as the Spirit of Tasmania fiasco, which has damaged Tasmania's business reputation both nationally and internationally, at cost to those initiatives which fundamentally would enable and assist Tasmanians to live better lives. The Spirit debacle is not sitting alone on the shelf. Watch this space.

As the member for Murchison said yesterday, there are serious questions to be had regarding the fiscal responsibility - or lack thereof - of the Tasmanian Liberal minority government. The member commented that we, Tasmania, are in the worst possible position predicted in the 2021 fiscal sustainability report, if not worse. It is well accepted that the government is in unsustainable levels of debt and needs to lower its deficit spending. The Tasmanian Liberal government themselves recognise this; however, the Budget fails to do so.

Debt servicing costs will only become a greater issue facing Tasmania. The faster the government moves to address the overspending, the better. It is important that we have an effective and realistic fiscal strategy which strongly addresses overspending and aims to place Tasmania firmly on a path to fiscal responsibility. On this note, I simply do not understand how the government can pass a state budget which, on its face, pretends to be about deficit reduction and responsible spending and, at the same time, extol the virtues of an unfunded, expensive, poorly planned football stadium, bypassing accepted and appropriate planning processes, especially when this stadium is likely to blow out and cost further. It already has, and all indications suggest that it will more than likely continue to do so.
Speaking of the deficit reduction elements of the Budget, I am concerned with the legitimacy of the claims that this is a budget which promotes deficit reduction and responsible spending. Instead, I would like to draw attention to the continuation of deficit spending which this Budget represents. The sale of government business enterprises cannot, and should not, replace a responsible spending plan. Saul Eslake is quoted by the ABC:

The government is in the financial pickle it's now in because it kept increasing spending without giving any thought as to how that spending (however justified) should be paid for.

And this Budget shows it still hasn't been able to break that habit.

For example, the cost to the Budget from the cheaper fares on buses is minimal, while the impact of providing nominal-fare fees to average Tasmanians is high. I note Tasmania is a state in which public transport is not synonymous with transport. Many people drive, walk and ride to the places they need to go. Those who utilise public services in Tasmania are often those who cannot afford other services or are otherwise disadvantaged.

Providing low-cost public transport is a boon to less well-off Tasmanians. I should note older Tasmanians are not included in this extension. Meanwhile, in other states, seniors receive free transport options. This is a concern to the Council on the Ageing (COTA), the peak Tasmanian body representing older Tasmanians. While the government has recognised this initiative for students and a narrow base of adults, failing to maintain low prices for public transport will do great harm to less fortunate Tasmanians.

Surely, the minimal increase to the Budget of such a measure is outweighed by the benefits. This is especially so when compared to other much more frivolous spending by the Tasmanian government. I need only to point to Macquarie Point stadium, the recent blowout of the Spirit berth and other unnecessary infrastructure investments.

To me, this is simply representative of an inconsistent and ineffective budgetary prioritisation fuelled by previously poorly managed projects and bad ideas. Compare this to necessary infrastructure investments to the Bass Highway in the north-west, infrastructure upgrades to northern roads and upgrades to freight and transport infrastructure across the state. Such proposals provide direct and economic benefits and promote transport, road safety and traffic efficiencies for years to come. They also cost far less than frivolous spending on some other areas. 

Prices are beginning to normalise since the COVID-19 pandemic and related aftereffects, and interest rates are gradually decreasing. However, this should not stop the government from taking fiscally conservative measures, reducing debt where it can, and not following through with frivolous spending and risky proposals. With that said, there are certain important areas I was disappointed to see that were not given a place in the Budget.

One such area is older Tasmanians: in their response to the Budget, COTA has expressed their disappointment and concern regarding what they see as government overlooking Tasmanians. Given the emphasis on health by the government in this Budget, one would expect to see some priority given to older Tasmanians. An important part of a holistic healthcare strategy is to care for the elderly. Healthy ageing represents a benefit to the long-term healthcare costs of the state. It was especially surprising to see the government, when posed the question at the state budget breakfast as to whether the Budget promoted digital literacy in Tasmania, they dodged the question and by reference to the e-scripts and digitisation in medicine.

I will acknowledge, however, that the government has been very proactive introducing a new red tape reduction portal in making it easier for Tasmanian businesses and those in the construction industry to report regulatory red tape that may be holding them back or costing them time and money.

All red tape submissions will be reviewed directly by the Red Tape Reduction Coordinator so appropriate action can be considered. Although I must admit, I did hear that term used 10 years ago. A portal for the construction industry will allow managers and office staff a convenient way to enter, process and provide information over days, weeks, months and even years. That is a big step forward. I am pleased to see that a portal system is being developed by the government to assist our building and construction industry in filling in their forms and paperwork.

In more recent times, I have also heard, received and heard comments about health already receiving enough funding. I find that alarming at many levels. However, I am going to take some time now to highlight an issue as an example of the need for further health funding. I have raised the issue before in this place, and I believe it is an issue that can be resolved. I also acknowledge that fellow members in this place can recognise, acknowledge and appreciate the circumstances of what I will be raising. Last week, I received a phone call from an older Tasmanian male wanting to thank me for the end-of-life choices (voluntary assisted dying) legislation as his wife had chosen the pathway a few days earlier. Two weeks ago, I was listening to a band at a relaxed family-friendly occasion when a man I did not know sat next to me and spoke about the loss of his 54-year-old wife, who just a few weeks beforehand chose the VAD pathway.

On Monday this week, I presented my 140th VAD forum at the Dementia Day Out in Ulverstone, which is very well attended. People and community groups are very interested in the end-of-life choice legislation. I am also aware over 150 Tasmanians have chosen VAD. I hope someone from the government is listening to this section of my speech, as this is very relevant for us to continue to provide VAD as a legal medical option.

Ms Forrest - I do not reckon they are right now. Sorry to disillusion you.

Mr GAFFNEY - Sorry, yes, but it will be on the record.

Unfortunately, the government has still not managed to provide the funding for a voluntary assisted dying practitioners portal in Tasmania. Tasmania was the third state in 2022 to pass VAD legislation and yet we, our doctors, still do not have access to a portal. A portal would greatly assist our health practitioners to be more effective and spend less time filling in paperwork. I have spoken with medical practitioners and administrators from other states and they are all appreciative of the portal. Many were actually gobsmacked that Tasmania does not have a portal in place. A portal process is the assessed and preferred option utilised in every other state. All other states and territories which have passed VAD legislation, except for the NT, appreciate the benefits of an effective portal process. It is an online system that allows doctors to complete and submit forms, access training and apply for permits to prescribe VAD medications.
I have been informed that a portal in Tasmania was not seen as viable. Unfortunately, Tasmanian doctors personally need to fill in forms themselves and sometimes the form must be completed in a few days or even hours, not days, weeks or months.

The added unnecessary stress on our doctors with heavy workloads and numerous commitments could be assisted with a portal system. I have included comments from four doctors who are involved with VAD in the state, and these are the comments I received.

Doctor number one:

I have heard about the red tape reduction and hope that can work with us as well. We have overworked doctors doing a lot of VAD and the process is turning them off. A portal is needed. We are coming up to our third anniversary and still no portal. This government can automatically and instantly accept and justify a $45 million increase for a Centre of Excellence above its original $60 million budget allocation. However, it cannot find any funding for a VAD portal which is so important for doctors and Tasmanians now and into the future.

Doctor number two:

Given there are not many doctors doing PNP work in Tasmania and noting significant workforce shortages in primary care in my specialty, it is essential the VAD process being streamlined and as efficient as possible.

He says:

The current system is clunky and email based and relies on downloading PDF forms, filling them out and emailing them to the Commission. Many of the forms are repetitive and redundant. A portal would make this so much more efficient for me. I could log on and complete my assessments quickly and efficiently. A portal could also measure how much time medical practitioners spend on filling in forms.

The third doctor:

Currently, the forms are sent to us by the Commission. We must wait for them to be emailed before we can complete them. The Commission prefilled the demographic info, which we must go into every form. A well-designed portal should not allow a form to be submitted unless all required areas are completed. A portal would not need any signatures or dates of completion. Currently, if we miss a field or box, the Commission will chase us and then there are a series of emails to-and-fro to amend the error.

For the regular practising medical practitioner, this can be incredibly intrusive into a normal working day. We cannot get forms over the weekend, which has affected some applications. With a portal, the doctors could get on with the case, particularly if needed to be expedited, without having to wait for the commissioner every step.
All the Commission do with the forms as they arrive is check for correctness and a portal should be able to do that, before allowing the forms to be submitted. We had one GP walk away, stating that she will consider returning to the space when there is a portal or significant improvement in the form. Given that the biggest issue for getting medical practitioners into this space is a non-remunerated administrative burden, a portal should be a priority.

The fourth and final doctor said:

Recently the Commission ceased sending some of the generic forms to the PNPs. They now send a OneDrive link. This means, instead of having the form immediately available as an attachment which can be printed, dragged and dropped, or typed into, we now need to find it. They are not even in alphabetical or numerical order on the OneDrive. Then having found it, we must then download it and manually save it before we can proceed. All the medical practitioners I have spoken to do not like the OneDrive, but none of them have complained to the commission. Let's stay with the slower, problematic version, as we can do it, we can do it for under $300,000, and besides, our doctors can suck it up as they are good people.

To a medical practitioner complaining to the commission, it is a bit like complaining to other regulatory bodies such as AHPRA and the PSB. It is intimidating and they feel that it is a waste of time, so it is not done. Many of the GPs who started in this space after the initial rush have left, all due to the excessive time required and no remuneration. Some have steadfastly stated they will only see their current patients. Two of the original cohorts of doctors have retired.

Health practitioners contact me as they know I have skin in this game, and that perhaps I am able to assist to get some results or at least raise to the members in this place, and the public in general, the concerns doctors have. These concerns have impacts on their professionalism, their health and, importantly, Tasmanians and families who gain so much from their support and assistance. I acknowledge that access to a portal is an important initiative and hopefully the government will see fit to provide a portal service for our doctors to assist Tasmanians from all walks of life.

The Budget lacks emphasis on preventive health care, and fails to address a growing obesity epidemic in Tasmania that will cost Tasmanians for years to come. The Tasmanian Council of Social Service said:

The government has failed to provide adequate funding for its own 20-year preventative healthcare strategy.

Speaking of addressing barriers to digital inclusion, the government has entirely failed to address the digital divide in the state. According to the Tasmanian Council of Social Services (TasCOSS), one in four Tasmanians face some form of barrier to digital inclusion. This is apparently an opportunity of $54 million of potential economic and social benefit. Yet, with this Budget, the government will not unlock a dollar. Failure to do so leaves behind over 54,000 Tasmanians who are either unable to get online or, if they can do so, lack the ability to navigate the online world.

As I foreshadowed, I also have substantial doubts about the privatisation agenda of this government. This agenda is extremely consequential, especially to rural and regional Tasmania, and must be considered in any discussion of this Budget. While I am glad some government enterprises have been excluded from privatisation, divestment of organisations such as Metro Tasmania worries me.

Rural and regional areas of Tasmania, such as my electorate of Mersey, do not have the profitability of Hobart or Launceston; therefore, private enterprises which are not adequately regulated have no reason to cater for those needs in this area. While the case can obviously be made for adequately regulated privatisation, simply put, I do not have the confidence in the government to do this.

For all the analysis, positive business cases and economic advice the privatisation proposal has received, the onus still lies squarely on the shoulders of the minority Tasmanian Liberal government to do it correctly. If divestment is not implemented correctly, it will be catastrophic for Tasmanians as well as rural communities.

Most importantly, after this agenda is complete, the representation which is currently available for those communities and people via their elected representatives will no longer exist. Therefore, I fear that there will be no easy way to rectify issues and address shifting needs of Tasmanians in circumstances where there is no profit interest to do so.

Moreover, on a platform aiming at promoting small businesses, startups and business enterprise in Tasmania, the Budget does nothing to provide the stability necessary for Tasmanian businesses.

QUESTIONS

Macquarie Wharf 6 - Upgrade - Federation Funding Agreement

Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE, Mr VINCENT

[2.31 p.m.]
I have here a copy of the Macquarie Point Urban Redevelopment Federation Funding Agreement between the Commonwealth and the state of Tasmania. It has a number of milestones in it which have a deadline of June this year and we are in June. I am hoping to obtain some information from you on progress.

The first is that there be an agreement signed by the Commonwealth and Tasmanian government for the upgrade of Macquarie Wharf, Wharf 6, in line with the requirements in the schedule at additional terms 1(IV) due in June 2025.

The second is the Commonwealth acceptance of the Macquarie Point Precinct Master Plan as prepared to implement the precinct plan.

Do you have any knowledge of this, and can you confirm whether it is on track?

This may be a question for one of your colleagues, Mr Abetz or Mr Ellis; delivery of a finalised housing plan developed in consultation with the Commonwealth which gives effect to the requirements in this schedule of additional terms 1(VI). I note that in this agreement there is no mention of the Macquarie Point Stadium.

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the member for Hobart. Most of what you asked there does come under Mr Abetz, and I have not been involved with any of that contractual situation.

Ms O'Connor - Does Wharf 6 come under Mr Abetz?

Mr VINCENT - Wharf 6 comes under me as TasPorts. The money has been allocated. They are working through with the government on the finalisation of those parts of the upgrade to Wharf 6. I am just looking here at the notes, which I will just check over. The government is committed to developing world-leading - we know that - and that is why the government has welcomed the $188 million. That does not come under that 30 June, but I had a meeting with TasPorts recently; they were close to having some more information on finalising that agreement for Wharf 6. I cannot think of anything else I have to add to that at this moment. I can check and come back to you.

Ms O'Connor - I am happy for you to do that, but are you confirming that agreement to be signed between the Commonwealth and Tasmania is in the process of being finalised?

Mr VINCENT - I am unaware of the situation with the Macquarie Point one because it does not come under my ministry. I know TasPorts on their side of the thing with the $188 million are working with State Growth to finalise that part of the contract.

Ms O'Connor - The agreement signed between the Commonwealth and Tasmanian government; who represents the Tasmanian government in this agreement?

Mr VINCENT - Sorry, I did not quite get that.

Ms O'Connor - Who represents the Tasmanian government in the signing of the agreement with the Commonwealth? It is to the original question about the Wharf 6 upgrade.

Mr VINCENT - I will check and try to get that right for you.

Ms O'Connor - Thank you -

Mr VINCENT - TasPorts has gone out for expressions of interest in Wharf 6, and as of a few days ago, we are very pleased with the submissions that they had received to this point, but there is nothing signed or anything further done on that. I do not believe that comes under 30 June; I think it is later on in the year for the finalisation.

Ms O'Connor - It is in the agreement. It says June 2025.

Mr VINCENT - Certainly what they are working to is - and they may well have already started that, by the fact that they have expressions of interest into the construction of the wharf and the person to lead that project - but I will seek clarification there for you on those points.
Ms O'Connor – Yes. Who represents the state of Tasmania? Thank you, minister.


Voluntary Assisted Dying Portal

Mr GAFFNEY question to ACTING LEADER of the GOVERNMENT in the LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Ms PALMER

[2.36 p.m.]
On 14 November 2023, I received the following response in this place from the honourable Leonie Hiscutt, then-leader of the government:

We [the Tasmanian government] are also exploring options via a voluntary assisted dying portal that best treats Tasmania's unique needs.

From the Victorian website, a voluntary assisted dying portal is an online system used by medical practitioners to manage requests for VAD. It allows them to complete and submit forms, access training, and apply for permits to prescribe VAD medications. The portal is secure and ensures compliance with the Voluntary Assisted Dying Act 2017.

Tasmania was the third state to pass and implement VAD legislation in Australia. Victoria did in June 2019 and Western Australia July 2021. Tasmanian legislation was implemented in October 2021; Queensland, January 2023; South Australia, January 2023; New South Wales, November 2023. In the ACT, a voluntary assisted dying act has passed but will not be implemented until November of 2025.

Acting Leader:

All six states have VAD legislation. However, Tasmania is the only state not to have a portal system in place. Why is that so?

What unique needs are there in Tasmania which has meant that a portal system is yet to be in place?

Medical practitioners are very busy, and to waste time rewriting, and filling in by hand, forms that are then emailed or scanned and sent to others involved in the VAD process seems to be an ineffective utilisation of health professionals' time. As portals are effective and efficient ways for medical practitioners to complete and submit necessary paperwork, why is there not a Tasmanian portal system in place?

The Victorian portal system was developed in-house and the Western Australian system was developed for less than $2 million. Why is it that other states can implement, design and afford a portal, and Tasmania cannot?

In 2023, it was stated in this place that options are being explored.

How much will the VAD portal system cost for Tasmania?
Is the funding for the portal in this year's Budget?
If not, why?
If the funding is in the Budget, when will the portal be available for health professionals to use?

Is it a concern to this government that a portal system is not yet functioning, and whilst we were before most other jurisdictions in passing and starting legislation, that we are indeed well behind in utilising a portal system?

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the member for the question. I am answering on behalf of the Minister for Mental Health and Wellbeing.

Tasmania's End-of-Life Choices (Voluntary Assisted Dying) Act 2021 (the act) imposes record keeping and notification requirements on medical practitioners. It requires decisions to be documented using approved forms. It also requires documentation that is completed to be provided to Tasmania's Voluntary Assisted Dying (VAD) Commission. These are mandatory elements of Tasmania's voluntary assisted dying law.

I am advised that the Department of Health is currently scoping a data management system which will address the concerns of practitioners with the act's documentation and notification requirements. I have further been advised that the current systems being explored are within the existing funding allocation for VAD and could cost around $300,000.

Given the complexity of the legislation, system development has been staged to ensure it is informed by experience and meets the needs of patients and practitioners. Work to refine documentation, to remove duplication and to enable increased electronic completion is ongoing.

Options for a Tasmanian portal similar to the portals in place in Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland, were explored during the act's implementation but were not considered viable.

I am further advised that there is no evidence that a lack of an online portal is hindering access to voluntary assisted dying for Tasmanians. In 2023-24, around 47 per cent of people who made a first request for voluntary assisted dying in Tasmania died by way of administration of a VAD substance. This proportion is similar to proportions recorded for Queensland (51 per cent), Victoria (51 per cent) and Western Australia (49 per cent). It is also greater than the proportions for New South Wales (40 per cent) and South Australia (38 per cent), all of whom have online portals.

Mr PRESIDENT - The member for Mersey.

Mr GAFFNEY - I have a supplementary question.

Supplementary Question

[2.41 p.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY - Is the Leader and the government aware that the statistics that were just read to this parliament have got nothing to do with the question? It is about the effective workload of the doctors. The last answer is very irrelevant in what was being asked. Our doctors work harder to try to get those statistics where they are. I was wondering if the government is serious in that response sent to me and to be put in Hansard, because it is ridiculous.

I am happy to submit another question to the relevant minister if you would like me to do that.


Launceston Nurses' Home - Sale

Ms ARMITAGE question to ACTING LEADER of the GOVERNMENT in the LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Ms PALMER

[2.42 p.m.]
Regarding the disused Nurses' Home in Launceston, about which I have asked a number of questions to date.

Can the leader please provide an update to the status of this property?

Has the property been sold? 

If so, can you please advise the value for which the property has been sold?

Can you please advise to whom the property has been sold? 

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the member for the question. 

In November 2023, the Department of Health made the decision to dispose of the former Launceston Nurses Home. However, the site contains several other health facilities and services the department wishes to retain.

The property has not been sold. To prepare the former Nurses' Home for disposal, a new title must be created to exclude the remainder of the property from the sale. Draft survey advice has recently been provided to the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania, which includes the proposed boundary adjustment. The Department of Health is currently working with the Office of the Crown Solicitor and the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania to have the property surveyed and the new titles created. In the meantime, the Department of Health has installed temporary fencing to deter unauthorised access, and regular security patrols are undertaken.

Tasmania's AFL Team

Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER for SPORT and EVENTS, Mr DUIGAN

[2.44 p.m.]
You would be aware of the events that are unfolding today and the seriousness of the potential consequences. Today we have had Kath McCann from the Devils come out and make public statements about today's political events that are unfolding, given the potential consequences for us retaining the team.

Have you, as minister for sport, made any contact with anyone at the AFL to update them on the situation and to make a pitch for us to keep our team at least?

ANSWER

Mr President, yes, noting the conversations that are happening in the other place and the impact that is very likely to have on Tasmania having its own AFL team, I have certainly been in contact with our club to understand how that feels for them. You would understand and you would have seen and heard the issues there. I understand they are having conversations with the AFL as that goes on, but we have been very clear that if there is no stadium, there is no team.

Ms O'Connor - That is what they call being a quitter.

Mr DUIGAN - Thank you, appreciate that.

Ms O'Connor - I am disappointed to hear you yourself are not on the phone to the AFL.


Education - Staff Wellbeing Model

Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[2.45 p.m.]
We know teacher retention is a challenge for you and the department. There are a whole range of reasons for that. Mental distress, school-based violence and bullying are increasing. As members will know, there is currently an inquiry into bullying. I understand you are awaiting the results of that inquiry.

How will the new staff wellbeing model address these growing issues and needs? Will this translate into extra support for staff such as social workers, psychologists and education support specialists in our schools?

ANSWER

Mr President, I will start by saying it is horrifying at times to hear what some of our teachers are dealing with in our schools. It is really important from my perspective as education minister to say that the responsibility around bad behaviour in schools on bullying, sometimes between children, sometimes between a child and a teacher and sometimes involving families and parents, is absolutely unacceptable.

It is not wholly the responsibility of schools to manage this problem; it is an issue society needs to take responsibility for. However, I am very aware of the pressures on our amazing teaching staff, and it has been a very clear focus of mine over the past 12 months. As part of the new funding through the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement, I directed the department to assign a portion of this new funding to the establishment of a new school staff wellbeing response team.

Now we are still working through the finer details of how this team will function. I am absolutely confident these individuals will provide direct specialist support to school leaders from both the proactive wellbeing coordination and a planning perspective, as well as assisting with support coordination during and after a critical incident. This will be an extra layer of wellbeing support for school staff. It is not replacing what we currently have. It is adding another layer to the support we already have, and it will be a very targeted response team.

They will work directly with schools we identify as needing some additional assistance, but they will also be able to respond when there is, for example, an incident at a school where an immediate response and extra support is required. That body of work is being led by our education Secretary and there has been a great response from stakeholders, is my understanding, to this particular wellbeing response team we are standing up.

I also acknowledge your comments on our need for speech and language pathologists, social workers and for school psychologists. We know they play such a vital role in the wellbeing of our schools. Over the last decade, our government has employed record numbers of staff. That has seen an overall number of professional support staff on the ground, an increase of 101.15 FTE. That is the number as of March of this year -

Ms O'Connor - Since when, sorry, to March this year?

Ms PALMER - 31 March 2025.

Ms O'Connor - Back to when?

Ms PALMER - Over the last decade.

Ms O'Connor - Thank you.

Ms PALMER - We continue to support this workforce and certainly are doing everything we can to bolster this workforce, including funding 20 new scholarships for the next generation of speech and language pathologists and psychologists in Tasmania. This funding is in addition to the nine scholarships already made available for speech pathology from 2024. Professional support staff shortages are indeed a national issue, we know that. Other jurisdictions are facing the same issues we are but, at times, Tasmania faces unique additional challenges due to our size and also our dispersed population. We are certainly doing everything we can to bolster those positions.

I had the great privilege of meeting two of the new scholarship recipients. One was a young woman from Western Australia, another was a young woman from Victoria, who had come to Tasmania because of the incentive of those scholarships. It was wonderful to see the work that they were doing in our schools. They were excited to be here in Tasmania. My hope is that they will remain in Tasmania even after the benefits of the scholarship are done.


ANSWER TO QUESTION ON INDULGENCE

Macquarie Wharf 6 - Upgrade - Federation Funding Agreement

[2.52 p.m.]
Mr VINCENT (Prosser - Minister for Infrastructure) - Mr President, I have some further information for the member for Hobart's question. Information has come in to help me with that. I have been advised that the Premier signed the Wharf 6 federal funding agreement with the Commonwealth on 10 February. Furthermore, I am advised that the milestones that were due by 30 June-July 2025 are well progressed and the term sheet between the state and TasPorts is currently being finalised as we speak.


SUSPENSION OF SITTING

[2.53 p.m.]
Ms PALMER (Rosevears - Acting Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move -

That the sitting be suspended until the ringing of the division bills.

The purpose of this is for briefings on the Youth Justice Facility Development Bill 2025.

[2.53 p.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - I need to seek some clarity from the Acting Leader of the Government. Is the government's intention that we debate and pass this bill today despite the fact we have incredible uncertainty over the government as we speak?

[2.54 p.m.]
Ms PALMER (Rosevears - Acting Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council) - Absolutely.

Sitting suspended from 2.54 p.m. to 5.00 p.m.


MOTION

Budget Papers 2025-26 and Appropriation Bills (No. 1 and No. 2) - Noting

Resumed from above (page 29).

[5.01 p.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) – Mr President, because we were halted midstream, I think people might have lost the flow of my conversation. I only have a few minutes left.

The GBE sale is not a stable idea. The government continuously changes the parameters and frankly it cannot be trusted to execute it properly. Meanwhile, the government is plunging Tasmanians into unknown levels of debt and continuously bungling projects and proposals. The current state of Tasmania is not one stable enough for start-ups, Tasmanian businesses and enterprises. The Budget has done nothing to rectify this; rather, it has left Tasmania in even less stable water.

Just Tuesday, the leader of the Tasmanian Labor Party, Mr Winter, tabled a vote of no confidence in the lower House. As Ms Forrest stated on Tuesday, there is a massive trust deficit in this government. To my mind, this is the fundamental flaw which permeates the Budget, the government and many of its proposals. There are constant questions to their mandate, their transparency, their economic proposals, and their vision for Tasmania. This Budget does not resolve those questions and instead brings more to the table.

I do not bring these individual concerns up with the mind to merely highlight independent funding issues within the current Budget. It is easy to back and forth between line items which are good or bad, but this is not the point. Instead, these issues represent a large problem that the Budget faces. Simply put, it is not a budget that cohesively aims to better Tasmania while responsibly approaching the Tasmanian financial situation which the Premier was elected to solve.

The budget that Tasmanians need is one which balances the getting of the most bang for its buck in the areas that need it most, while sacrificing where Tasmania can afford to do so. This Budget does neither of those things. It struggles to address issues which should not cost much to rectify, while overspending on items which should not exist at all. To my mind, this Budget is an awkward blend of some minor budget reduction measures and gratuitous spending, underpinned by a fundamentally flawed assumption that the sale of GBEs will pay for it. 

While there are various spending items which will support my electorate, the fundamental premise of the Budget is not in keeping with the actions of the government. Indeed, many of the projects receiving funding in the Mersey electorate have already been announced and acknowledged in previous budgets. Spending on a whim on proposals while promising budget reduction can only lead to risky business moves, such as the sale of GBEs. Consequently, risky business moves spurred by financial concerns are not those which a responsible government should support. 

The broad problem is that the government have not undertaken adequate spending management, nor have they undertaken the structural reform which should be included for a forward-facing budget. These actions are what the current government do have a mandate for, as a party that prides itself in economic management; not the unprecedented sale of GBEs or ridiculous stadium proposals but instead being a precedent of responsible fiscal management and demonstrating responsible spending practices.

To conclude, I thank members for their contributions on this Budget, both in critique and support. It is a challenging endeavour to balance responsible government expenditure with the needs of various sectors, communities and socio-economic groups. I am sympathetic to the difficulty in attempting to gradually reduce the deficit and balance the budget. However, I do not feel that the spending priorities of the government are reflective of their stated budget objectives.

I note the 2025-26 Budget.

[5.05 p.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - Mr President, I rise today to note the Tasmanian Budget 2025-26. Under usual circumstances, I would be rising after our leader, Dr Rosalie Woodruff, had delivered her budget in reply in the other place, as well as tabled our alternative budget, which sets out our values and our spending priorities and where we would make savings. Obviously, events have overtaken the other place. I will not speak to our alternative funding choices, but I will make some observations about the Budget.

I have never seen a budget quite like this one. Listening very closely to all honourable members' contributions, from statements about whether or not this Budget was supportable through to the government saying this is a Budget that gets the priorities right, that strikes the right balance; there is no argument in this Budget that it gets the balance right. I particularly appreciated, Madam Deputy President, your contribution on Tuesday, because it laid out with searing clarity the devastating financial situation the state is in.

As I understand it, only a few years ago, net debt was sitting at around $1-2 billion. In 2014, when the Liberals first took office, as I recall, there was no net debt. We were told that there was $1 billion dollars in net debt embedded over the forward Estimates. That was what we were accused of after the Liberals came to office. Some members who are here at the time will remember the 2011 global financial crisis Budget.

The reason I raised that is that we understood the gravity of the moment in government. There was some healthy tension between the two parties in government, but we shared a commitment to fix the budget. For that, we copped an enormous amount of criticism and political heat. Looking back now, we left the state's finances in very good shape. Yet here we are, looking at more than $10 billion in net debt by 2028-29. The numbers are staggering. I am frightened for the people we represent. I am frightened for the kids and for our grandchildren.

In the end, when you look back over the past decade, it is like all the chickens have come home to roost. We have had a government that ever since it was elected - and this is not a criticism of individual decent government MPs; it definitely is not. This is about culture. The culture of the Liberals in government has been one of arrogance; total secrecy; hiding information; misleading about motive; a real talent for dishonesty; and a deafness to what our constituents and communities are telling us about what they care about.

An appalling corporate capture, whether it is Gillon McLachlan and the AFL walking into town and telling this government how it is going to be and our Premier going sure, no worries, and not taking that agreement to Cabinet, or the big salmon corporations who basically write the regulations here, do their own monitoring and have been responsible for devastating impacts on the marine environment which are ongoing.

But because of this government's attachment to secrecy, we do not know the extent of the damage to the marine ecosystem, we do not know the full extent of the risk to human health of having, for example, 1.1 tonnes of antibiotics dumped into southern waters since the beginning of summer. That is 1.1 tonnes of antibiotics like tetracycline in our marine environment - corporate capture.

You would have to say the same for big gambling. We were on track to have some of the best harm minimisation measures in our gambling establishments in the country: mandatory pre-commitment. We had then a treasurer who effectively staked his political reputation on the line and made a commitment to mandatory pre-commitment in order to minimise the harm from gambling and what happens? Big gambling wins that fight too.

We are in this situation because of a cultural problem within government. I feel a genuine sympathy for the Premier at the moment, particularly today. But at some point, any point in the past 11 years, and particularly in the past few years when the state's finances started to careen south, what we needed was some courage in government. We needed some honesty and some courage because it is a fact that we all wear to an extent the decisions that were made to borrow during the beginning of the pandemic. That is a fact. We could have been participants in budget repair.

I listened to the opening from the member for Huon, Mr Harriss's contribution yesterday, and, correct me if I am wrong, but it seemed to me you were suggesting restoring the numbers in the House of Assembly was part of the problem or certainly had not been part of the solution. Well, my response to that is that while the new newly established House of 35 members has only been there since last March, the decisions that have brought us to this point started being made 10 to 11 years ago. It is not the parliament that holds the purse strings or makes these decisions about how to prioritise budget spending.

Yes, we have that power to reject a budget, but the gravity of a decision like that means it is one that very few responsible members of Parliament will undertake, but boy, we are being tested this time. I am going to keep my contribution quite short as we have other matters to deal with here today. I wanted to focus on a couple of things.

We cannot look at this Budget without looking at the fact there is $600 million embedded in it for the stadium and it is partly this commitment to an unaffordable stadium and a willingness to take us into another at least $2 billion of debt over the next 10 years which points us to how we got here. It is a casual regard for public money. It is a lack of preparedness to take responsibility for your spending decisions and, if you are overspending, to take responsibility for arguing for where you might make savings or where you might generate some revenue, for example.

I know this is a source of frustration to respected economist Saul Eslake, who has made a number of proposals to the government about how you might generate revenue. We still tax our resource-extracting corporations or the leases that we asked of them are the cheapest in the country. Whether it is big mining, big salmon, or the native forests, we give away. We give away our wealth and while we are doing that, we are allowing people to sleep in tents on The Domain. I do not know if anyone saw the story on Pulse today about the older woman who lay on a kerb for two hours waiting for an ambulance. The people at the Royal Hobart Hospital who, because the food there is so poor and there have been cuts to food, are ordering Uber Eats into the hospital. This is about choices. It is about choosing corporate welfare, choosing a stadium over community services, and choosing a stadium over the health and housing needs that Tasmanians have and the community services needs that Tasmanians have.

One area I particularly want to focus on is the environment. We are used to the environment, under this government, being treated like a thing only there to serve corporations and the political purposes of the government of the day. But, boy, budget paper 2, volume 1, page 181 - 'Revenue from appropriation by portfolio and output'. In primary industries, there have been cuts across the Forward Estimates. No cuts to the supervision of the poppy and hemp crops, a staggering cut to biosecurity and product integrity, a cut to water resources management, a cut to natural values management, a cut to environmental management, and a cut to threatened species protection.

This is at the same time - as we all know - that the life support systems of the planet are under enormous stress. We have decided to provide less money for environmental management. We apparently care less about keeping Tasmania pest and disease free because we have quite savagely cut biosecurity. Our life-giving rivers are having their funding cut, and the government says funding for the rural water use strategy has come to an end. Apparently, the rivers are all fine now, even though three years ago, as we know, the Temporal and Spatial Patterns Report into Tasmania's rivers found that about three quarters of them are in extreme stress, yet we are cutting funding to river health. We are also cutting funding to marine resources because, of course, there are initiatives that have now been completed. 

It is such a dog of a budget. It is quite depressing if you just talk about priorities, another reason that we are in the state we are in. Of course, it is really important that we keep Tasmanians active and social, but as the member for Hobart, who is very sympathetic, obviously, to the pleas for community sporting infrastructure that we hear from community sporting organisations, and the member for Elwick who does a terrific job advocating for community sports. Within this list on page 23 of the propaganda materials that were released on Budget Day, the overview document, we have seven community sports projects in Braddon being funded, one in Franklin, one in Bass, and one in Clark. That tells you a fair bit, does it not? The government is transparently pork-barrelling and prioritising northern electorates. All these look like very worthwhile initiatives to fund, but you could not argue there is any equity here, Madam Deputy President.

Oh, Mr President.

Mr PRESIDENT - It has been a long day.

Ms O'CONNOR - It has been a long day. You have to be quick here. It has been a long day and I am very mindful of that.

The Local Government Association submission, the State Budget Priority Statement had some incredibly modest asks in it. One of them was for an extension of funding and I hope Mr Vincent can point me to where I cannot see this in the Budget. I want to be wrong.

They asked for $550,000 over two years to continue the Tasmanian Local Government Climate Capability Program. We sat down with the Local Government Association to talk about this Climate Capability Program. The way it works is that there is one person who is paid to engage with councils statewide to connect expertise, knowledge, projects and to have a holistic statewide response to some of the risks posed to local government as a result of a heating planet. That program has been underway for two years; it has barely got off the ground. Yet the government could not afford $550,000 over two years to help local government, which means the people they represent, to adapt to climate change. Terrifying.

Ms Webb - It is shameful.

Ms O'CONNOR - It is shameful.

Ms Webb - The smaller councils will feel the brunt and loss of that even more. The bigger councils may have the capacity, but the smaller councils will not.

Ms O'CONNOR - That is right. That work just simply will not be done when we need to be focusing on adapting to what is barrelling down at us.

We have here the Tasmanian Government Climate Change Action Plan 2023-25. In response to some questions that I put on notice, we now find out only through a response to a question on notice with no announcement from government, they said there was a commitment made and it is in writing in this action plan, that this action plan would be updated in 2025. We found out just last week there will be no updated Climate Change Action Plan. We have had cuts to the environment across the board and we have also had cuts to the Climate Change Office. That is a failure of the Minister for the Environment to advocate in her portfolio.

Perhaps, it was impossible to as the budget went through Cabinet when the focus was so strongly on the stadium.

We have here the government's response to the State of the Environment Report. If you want to look for funding in the Budget for State of Environment Report initiatives, I can save you the trouble. They talk about part of this response is that they have a Rural Water Use Strategy in place and a Climate Change Action Plan for 2023-25, neither of which were funded.

What this government does not get is that part of what makes us so great and a part of what Tasmanians are so proud of, is our natural environment. Yet it is constantly degraded, neglected, overridden and marginalised as part of our life support system under this government. Which has its priorities so far wrong that it is on its knees in the other place.

I could make a much longer contribution on the Budget today. It all feels a bit precarious. I am certainly looking forward to estimates next week, but what a devastatingly disappointing budget. I cannot marry what is in these documents with the garbage that comes out of the government's mouth. My final word is this, and I was very thankful the member for Nelson raised this in her excellent contribution, everything we want to know about this government's attitude towards ethical conduct in public office, we can know from the way the Integrity Commission has been treated.

Not only does the state's watchdog not receive any increase in funding after Chief Commissioner Greg Melick AO KC made repeated calls for funding to be increased so the commission could do its statutory function. Not only is there no increase in funding over the four years, there is a cut in Integrity Commission funding emblematic. We have small change being given to the National Preventive Mechanism to prevent people from being tortured in places of detention.

An appalling budget and an indictment on a government that has been in office for far too long and never really had the foundational ethical principles right from the beginning and here we are.

I move -

That the debate on the appropriation bills be adjourned.

Motion agreed to; debate adjourned.


YOUTH JUSTICE FACILITY DEVELOPMENT BILL 2025 (No. 19)

Second Reading

[5.27 p.m.]
Ms PALMER (Rosevears – Acting Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council) Mr President, I move -

That the bill be read a second time.

I bring to the House today a bill that supports the urgent delivery of the new Tasmanian Youth Justice Facility, which will provide for the fundamental rehabilitation and developmental needs of children and young people in detention in Tasmania and deliver on our commitment to close the Ashley Youth Detention Centre as soon as possible.

The goal of the government's youth justice reform program is to improve community safety, reduce the involvement of children and young people in the youth justice system and improve outcomes for children and young people who do offend.

The government's Youth Justice Blueprint is underpinned by a public health approach which is focused on supporting children and young people to address the factors that led to their offending in the first place, thereby breaking the cycle of reoffending. This approach will drive the operational model of the new facility and the youth justice system within which it operates.

Establishment of the new facility is a priority project under the Youth Justice Blueprint and a prerequisite for the commission of inquiry's recommendation 12.1, to close Ashley Youth Detention Centre as soon as possible.

Significant work has already been undertaken to accelerate the project, including:

establishment of the Youth Justice Reform Taskforce, a Youth Justice Reform Expert Panel, Aboriginal Reference Group and Community Reference Group;
development of a Tasmanian Youth Justice Model of Care;
selection and public consultation on site options for the new facility;
completion of site investigations including Aboriginal heritage, threatened species and geotechnical surveys;
engagement with local councils, neighbouring landowners, land users and businesses;
confirmation of 466 Brighton Rd, Pontville as the site for the new facility;
appointment of the lead design consultant and consultant team and commencement of facility design;
Cabinet approval of a revised project budget estimate;
finalisation of the Tasmanian Youth Justice Facility Masterplan, which has now been released;
commencement of a public engagement period on the masterplan; and
design and planning for site access, landscaping and enabling site services is currently underway.

This bill will enable the Tasmanian Youth Justice Facility project to progress with greater certainty and reduce potential risks and significant delays to the project receiving approval under the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993 (LUPAA).

We recognise the importance of ensuring that this legislation is narrowly targeted. It is limited in its operation to the facility, with clearly prescribed parameters to constrain the scope of development permitted under the act. 

To this end, the bill creates a new act that will enable the declaration of the project such that the act will only apply to this development on this site:

for the purposes of constructing a youth justice facility for, or on behalf of, the state;
up to a certain size (both floor area and height);
where appropriate setbacks are provided; and
where on-site wastewater treatment is below a certain threshold.

The bill establishes a modified LUPAA approval process to ensure the project can proceed with minimal further delay, while maintaining appropriate safeguards and public input. 

It ensures that the project will be approved by the planning authority and will exclude third-party appeals, which could potentially delay the project by up to 12 months.

Importantly, the bill provides for the development to be assessed by the Southern Midlands Council under the normal LUPAA process, including a public exhibition period and community representations. This means that the community can still have its say. The council will still assess the project against the planning scheme.

In a similar manner, the bill ensures a clear path to construction by removing the need for notification prior to protection work being undertaken under the Building Act 2016, and by preventing disputes about protection works from delaying construction.

The bill will also allow the Minister for Children and Youth to direct the Recorder of Titles to create, amend, rearrange or extinguish a folio of the register to facilitate the consolidation of land titles, including 466 Brighton Road title (the site) and 36 Rifle Range Road title (for the access road to the site) following consultation with the Treasurer, the minister responsible for the Crown Lands Act 1976, and the minister responsible for the Youth Justice Act 1997.

Finally, the bill provides that a resolution of both Houses of parliament will exempt the project from the requirements of the Public Works Committee Act 1914, given the assessment of the project's necessity or advisability has already been substantially met through the commission of inquiry itself and related parliamentary committees, which have upheld the need for this project to be completed as a matter of urgency.

This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to replace a dated and inappropriate facility with a purpose-built environment that reflects contemporary thinking on youth justice, rehabilitation and trauma-informed care.

There is significant public support and expectation for this project to be delivered as soon as possible. Significant work has been done to come up with a site and design that meets these expectations.

This bill will ensure the facility can be delivered in 2027. Without it, the project could be delayed for a further 12 months or prevented from proceeding at all.

This bill has been opened for public feedback. Through this process, the government received three submissions. The first, from the Southern Midlands Council, suggests that consideration be made to strengthen the provisions relating to the application of LUPAA to avoid any doubt that the Council must grant a permit for the proposed development. Additionally, the Southern Midlands Council raised that the current bill could require a permit for development that does not meet the requirements of the planning scheme, and concerns regarding the works to Rifle Range Road, which the bill does not provide approvals for. 

The submission from the Brighton Council expressed opposition to the bill on the basis it could undermine confidence in Tasmania's planning system, and that the removal of appeal rights contradicts planning principles, especially with regard to public participation in the process.

Additionally, Brighton Council noted that unresolved issues remain around the facility's potential impacts on neighbouring land uses, questioning how these will be addressed if approval is guaranteed.

The final submission, received from a group of legal academics, claims that the bill bypasses existing planning laws, limits council's role as planning authority, requires members of parliament to approve the development, imposes unreasonably short time frames and related matters.

It should be noted, however, that the submission contains several errors and incorrect assumptions. In response to the matters raised in these submissions, I will outline the following.

This bill provides for an assessment to be undertaken using the existing Land Use and Planning Approvals Act in a particular way for this specific project.

The bill does not provide power to parliament to approve the development. The final permit will be issued by the planning authority consistent with an ordinary development application.

The role of 'planning authority' remains largely as it would for any 'permitted' application, whereby the planning authority is responsible for the assessment of the application and any conditions or restrictions considered before the permit is issued.

The bill encourages public involvement and participation through the public exhibition process, whereby the planning authority will be able to receive and consider representations - consistent with the process for a 'discretionary' planning application.

It will be incumbent on the Tasmanian government to provide sufficient information in the development application to address potential impacts and for these to be assessed by the planning authority as part of its consideration of the application.

Under the bill, the planning authority will have the same amount of time to consider and assess the development application as with any other discretionary development (including public exhibition). In response, the government proposed to amend the bill to include additional wording to confirm that a permit must meet the requirements of the Tasmanian Planning Scheme for the permit to be issued, which would be consistent with how any 'permitted' application would be treated.

The works to Rifle Range Road are a matter for Brighton Council and following further discussions with that council, I am advised that the bill does not need to be amended to include the proposed works to Rifle Range Road as they will be able to be dealt with via an exemption under LUPAA from the requirement to seek development application.

Public Works Committee exemption is being sought as the need to close the Ashley Youth Detention Centre and build a new facility is widely acknowledged.

I also note that the government moved amendments to the bill as drafted that were supported in the House of Assembly on 27 May 2025. In summary, these amendments are:

to amend the definition of 'relevant site' to ensure that the bill continues to apply after adhering the two titles associated with 466 Brighton Road and 36 Rifle Range Road. This amendment is required as once the two titles are adhered, the existing title reference will no longer apply. This change will ensure that the bill continues to apply after adhering the titles.

To increase the gross floor area to be inclusive of enclosed roof plant spaces, noting that this does not change the footprint of the facility from the masterplan and the scope and bed numbers remain the same. This amendment is proposed for avoidance of doubt, noting variations in interpretation of gross floor area.

To safeguard the 20-metre setback provision at the shared boundary with privately owned properties, while simultaneously permitting the development to take place in closer proximity to the boundary between the two government-owned parcels of land.

To clarify the requirement that approval must be granted only where the requirements of the planning scheme can be met in direct response to the matter raised by the Southern Midlands Council. The council identified that under the prior wording, a permit must be granted regardless of whether the application met the requirements of the scheme. This change ensures that approval must be granted only where the requirements of the planning scheme can be met.

I commend the bill to the House.

[5.40 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, it is a little bit disappointing that we are dealing with this today. It was something that we were not expecting to deal with at least until tomorrow. I am aware of all the things that are happening in the other place. I think you would have to be blind Freddy not to be.

This is really serious legislation and we have had some legitimate and genuine concerns raised with it. I have not put anything together, except my thoughts in my head, so this may be a bit disjointed. I know that the minister, Mr Jaensch, has offered me a briefing. He wanted to get in my head on Friday and I told him to go away, because I was trying to read the budget papers - I do read the budget papers from cover to cover - and prepare for Estimates; who knows what is happening with that. I also had a particularly sick family member, trying to deal with all that and he was trying to get in my head and tell me that. I did put him off and had a briefing on Monday. I appreciate the effort the minister is going to, to try to inform us of why he wants this piece of legislation through and why he wants it through now. Generally, during the budget session, we deal with legislation related to the Budget. You can argue this is because there is $151 million in the Budget for this facility and the new model of care.

I think I can safely say everyone in this Chamber wants to see Ashley closed, but I will let everyone speak for themselves on that. I certainly know it is a horror show, it has been a horror show for a very long time. It has harmed so many children and young people. Young people and children who often find themselves there are not even convicted of a crime. Children and young people who often come from very disadvantaged backgrounds, who have been let down by our systems, and have not received the support they needed to avoid ending up in Ashley. Many of them are from my electorate.

We know that it was all laid bare in the commission of inquiry. Well, there are probably horror stories which we have not heard. Rest assured that what we did hear from those who have been harmed in that place is probably just the tip of the iceberg. Absolutely, it needs to close. A commitment was made many years ago that it would close and here we are, still moving along at a pace that could hardly be described as speedy. We have landed with a bill that wants us to take an alternative approach to approving a new facility. It is concerning in that it removes the usual rule of law application, to the proponent, the government. We have a few pieces of legislation along these lines, but it does not make them right. Passing one does not mean that we should pass all of them.

I have not had time to fully digest all the information, but I do want to read from the briefing paper that we received from Anja Hilkemeijer and Dr Cleo Hansen-Lohrey, who provided a couple of briefing notes to us in relation to this bill. The one that they referred to today I will read from, because it is really important we understand, if we agree to this legislation, what we are agreeing to. They say that:

We present feedback to the minister on this bill because we are concerned about the bill's impact on the rule of law requirement that the law applies equally to all, including the government. The rule of law requirement that legislation must be clearly expressed; and constitutional administrative law principles regarding the importance of scrutiny of government action by parliament and independent tribunals. 

They go on to talk about the first concern regarding the planning authority's discretion under the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993 (LUPAA). Section 10 of the bill - this is the bill we are talking about now - states that the application of the youth justice facility is an application for a discretionary permit under section 57 of the LUPAA. Now, as I understand it, a youth justice facility or such a facility is only ever discretionary, and it is discretionary on rural land. That is the situation. It is a discretionary use and that would be treated through the planning process – and I have never been in a planning authority; there are many more people in this Chamber who would be far more experienced in that than me and I will be interested in their views. 

With a discretionary use, there is a process to go through. The application must go out for public comment; they have to meet some criteria to create acceptable solutions for the issues that may or may not be. It is open to appeal, whereas a permitted use is not open to appeal because it is permitted under the planning scheme. I have been here long enough to know that we have made a number of changes to planning law over the years to try to expedite permitted-use developments like a house that a person wants to build, on a block of land that is zoned residential; they are not going to offend setbacks, they are not going to offend height restrictions, they are not going to offend anything. It fits within the planning scheme; yes, they get approval. 

That is what that process is for, but where you have something else that does offend some of those things, then it is a discretionary use, and it is up to the council and the planning authority, through that process, to make a determination about whether or not that should succeed. Now, I take on board the minister's comments that should this application, rather than being a youth justice facility, be an abattoir or a fish food factory or a fish processing plant or a mine, that it is a permitted use. It could not be appealed on the fact that it was a mine or a fish food factory or an abattoir, but there are still rights of appeal in relation to things that come from that. 

In the case of an abattoir, those who have driven past Greenham at Smithton will know there is quite the smell, depending on which way the wind is blowing as to how offensive you might find that. I do not particularly like bacon, and when you drive past and the wind is blowing that way, that is what you smell, and probably other things as well I do not want to bear to think about. There are still processes around meeting those requirements. We have other laws that govern some of that. When you turn off any capacity to appeal other than through the Supreme Court - when we have set up TASCAT to replace the RMPAT to provide that avenue - unless there is absolute evidence that TASCAT is not efficient, not capable of dealing with appeals in a timely manner, then I am not sure why we would do that.

I did ask in the briefing about TASCAT. Obviously, it is not something that is at the minister's fingertips; it is not his portfolio for a start, but I think when you are asking us to do this, you need to explain why it is such a problem. I asked to hear from the Southern Midlands mayor and general manager and their - I cannot think of the actual title of the other gentleman that was on the call, but in their planning space, obviously. I wanted to hear from them what they thought about this, partly the removal of the appeal rights, but also the switching of this process from a discretionary permit approach to a permitted permit approach, but with a discretionary aspect of public consultation, even though that can be ignored because you have to approve it anyway, with conditions probably, or meet some performance standard. 

They made an interesting observation that they were concerned about the removal of appeal rights. They thought maybe there was an option of rather than removing appeal rights, putting in a provision to ensure that any appeal was prioritised and expedited by TASCAT. I do not know how that would necessarily work, and I do not know what barriers there might be to progressing a matter through TASCAT as a priority, but I believe everyone agrees that we want a new youth justice facility built, and a new model of care, because we have failed the young people who fall foul of our law, or they end up in this facility through the services we provide to date, and the commission of inquiry made that really clear.

I do not think there is anyone who disagrees with that, but that does not mean you should trash your planning processes and should trash the rights of fellow Tasmanians to achieve it. I absolutely get the need to deliver this as quickly and as efficiently and as soon as possible. For the minister to sit across the table in the briefing today - it was good of him to come to the briefing, but to say that what he wants to be able to do is give absolute deadset dates as to when certain things will happen - well, I want a deadset date when you are going to deliver the DA to the council for their assessment. That is a good deadset date I would like to know.

I never expected that we would be here changing the process because he wants to better say with deadset certainty that this is going to be open on x day in x year. Even when you build a house that is permitted use, things can go a bit astray. Supplies might be caught up on the wharf somewhere, your windows might not arrive and so you have delays. That is what it is.

I am not sure, and the other members will speak for themselves, I believe he was a little bit disingenuous when he said that there are members and media who have been demanding dates. As a member of the commission of inquiry committee, sitting round that table, I know that no-one has actually asked for a specific date. What we have asked for, and particularly the member for Nelson has been very targeted with her questioning on this - and this is all on the public records, you can go and look at it on our Hansard - she was asking about where we are in the process, not the date on which it would be opened.

Let us be honest with what the actual pressure has been. The pressure is to close Ashley, but to do so we need a new facility with new models of care that not only provide for the children who will end up in that facility, but for the other children who do not need to be in that facility but need to be provided for in an alternative model of care and another safe environment, because what we should be focusing on here is having very few children in such a facility, no matter how nice and therapeutic it is. 

What we need to be doing is addressing the underlying, fundamental reasons that they end up there in the first place, when so much of that could be prevented: dealing with intergenerational poverty; dealing with intergenerational disadvantage; dealing with poor educational outcomes; dealing with homelessness; and dealing with untreated, unrecognised and unsupported mental health issues. These are the reasons a lot of these young people end up there. Lack of support for families who are struggling with parenting; lack of support for pregnant women who end up with harmed babies because of substance abuse because they do not know any other way; these are the reasons that we have more children than we should ending up in this system.

To go back to this letter from the two legal experts, if you like, they said that section 10(1)(b) of the bill then provides that the application must be approved by the planning authority if the application is an application that is able to be approved. Well, if it is a permitted use, it is obviously able to be approved; that is the way it has being treated, but they were concerned about the wording here - this was an amendment put in the other place to try it make it clear because the Southern Midlands Council had raised concerns that the bill, as it had been drafted, could require them to approve a development that did not meet the planning scheme. That would be unconscionable, obviously, so this amendment was put in to address that. I am no expert to say, 'yes, it does' or 'no, it does not', but they go on to say:

The meaning of the phrase 'an application that is able to be approved under LUPAA' is unclear. We have had many discussions among ourselves on what that phrase means, but we are still struggling to understand the precise operation of the phrase. That is not a good thing.

Now, these are people who are legal experts and they are not sure about what this clause really means. They go on to say:

While formally the planning authority will still exercise its discretion under LUPAA, in terms of deciding whether to approve or reject the application for the youth detention facility, as a matter of substance, the planning authority's capacity to exercise this discretion is limited because parliament, through section 10(1)(b) directs the planning authority as to how to exercise his discretion, namely in favour of approval.

You do not have any choice; you have to approve it. We heard from the Southern Midlands Council that it is unlikely that development, as what they know of it, would fall foul of the planning scheme, but that is not the point. Legislation should be clear, it should be unambiguous. They go on:

Therefore, while as a matter of form, it is correct to say that this bill, parliament, is not granting planning approval -

And that is true, unlike some other legislation that is sitting around somewhere downstairs, I believe, as a distraction to the horror show that is the Budget - that was my comment, not what these people said - I will go back to what they said:

As a matter of substance, parliament is directing the planning authority to grant that approval, except if it would be clearly prohibited under the planning scheme to do so. Normally, an application for a discretionary permit may be refused on one or two possible grounds.

If the application clearly does not comply with the planning scheme, the planning authority must refuse it. The amended section 10 preserves this ground.

Nevertheless, even if there is not a clear breach of the planning scheme, the planning authority may exercise its discretion to refuse to issue a permit if it determines, based on the consideration of all of the relevant information, including community representations, that the application is not sufficiently consistent with planning standards or criteria, or the overarching objective of the Tasmanian Resource Management and Planning System. 

It is this second possible basis for refusing to grant a permit that is removed by this bill. In our view, the practical effect of section 10(1)(b) is to modify the statutory discretion of the planning authority under LUPAA. While parliament has the authority to alter LUPAA to create a hybrid permitted and discretionary application process for this specific facility, we are concerned that doing so would undermine the rule of law principle that the law applies equally to all and the government is not above the law. This risks weakening public confidence in how Tasmania is governed.

Furthermore, it would also create an unusual arrangement which carries the risk of increasing confusion in the planning decision-making pathway. Therefore, in our view, the best approach would be to delete section 10(1)(b) and allow the existing process for discretionary permit applications under LUPAA to continue to apply both in form and in substance. If Section 10(1)(b) is to be retained, it should at the very least be amended to make parliament's intention absolutely clear.

So, that is a concern. The member for Elwick will no doubt speak about this. I am not familiar with all the language as well as you would be, member for Elwick, but the performance criteria that would be required to be met that would give rise to perhaps an approval or rejection, but being as you cannot reject, you cannot. To me, who has not worked through the provisions of LUPAA in that way, I find this extremely confusing. They go on.

Turning now to the question of removal of oversight by the Public Works Committee, I acknowledge the member for Mersey's email looking for an amendment to remove this provision that removes the Public Works Committee oversight. He will no doubt speak more to that, but they also raise concern about clause 12 of the bill removing oversight by the Public Works Committee over expenditure on the construction facility.

In a decision in September last year between the Attorney-General of Tasmania and Mr Casimaty, the High Court emphasised the vital role of this Parliament's Public Works Committee in strengthening political accountability of the executive government. In this context, the court referred to parliament's higher duties to scrutinise executive action. In addition to this important scrutiny function, the work of the Public Works Committee improves public confidence in the merits and execution of government building projects.

Therefore, while the need to close the Ashley Detention Youth Detention Centre is widely acknowledged, in our view, this does not mean that the way in which the new facility is built should proceed without the usual parliamentary oversight. While parliament has the power to remove oversight by the Public Works Committee, in our view, reducing executive accountability is undesirable and therefore section 12 of the Bill should be deleted.

Now, the member for Mersey will speak more to his intention regarding that, but the Public Works Committee is the front-end scrutiny. Yes, part of their role, and I will just go to the provision in the act because I think it is important, because the minister did refer to it too, this is section 15 of the Public Works Committee Act 1914 and under the functions of the committee under subsection (2), it says:

In considering and reporting on any work, the Committee should have regard to -

the stated purpose thereof;
the necessity or advisability of carrying it out;

Then the next part of that is irrelevant because it says: 

…where the work purports to be of a reproductive or revenue producing character, the amount of revenue which it may reasonably be expected to produce;

Well, obviously that is not relevant in a case like this. And

the present and prospective public value of the work -

and generally the Committee shall in all cases take such measures and procure such information as may enable them to inform or satisfy Parliament as to the expedience of carrying out the work.

We have this committee for a reason and one of the reasons the Public Accounts Committee has been so busy of late is that so many things are going pear-shaped in this state. Our job is to do the ex-post assessment for the money that has been spent, or that we have pulled in a couple that have been approved by the Public Works Committee but have not been completed, and that was around the COVID period because we were concerned about massive cost blowouts and that was related to the Sorell Emergency Services Hub and the Sorell School, but generally, we are looking at after the event or expenditure in progress, like the Devonport berth for example, and how much more that is going to cost us.

These committees are standing committees; they are a function of this parliament; they do not have to be re-established every parliament; they are statutory committees that have been agreed by this parliament to do the work. There may be a very good reason for taking it out, but if the legislation was to be approved with the amendment from the member for Mersey, still removing the appeal right, still changing the LUPAA application if you like, then the least we can do is provide a public process through the Public Works Committee to at least enable parliamentary scrutiny and a report to parliament.

The chair of the committee, the member for McIntyre, can speak for herself, which I am sure she will. I know that the Public Works Committee has busy times for a period, but I think the members of that committee would all understand that this is a priority. We have agreed with the commission of inquiry's recommendations. We all want to see this thing progressed. I would be staggered to think that members of that committee would not make themselves available as soon as possible once the information was provided to them. The member for McIntyre can probably inform me if I am wrong on this, but I would have thought the information provided to the Public Works Committee is information they are providing to the local council and to the other relevant stakeholders or regulators or authorities that will be getting this information through the process anyway. Now, if I am wrong about that - I have never been on that committee - I am happy to be corrected, but for the minister to say there is so much work that is required that will be in addition to what they are trying to do to get this delivered, I find it a little bit unlikely. But, if I am wrong, I am happy to be corrected and I am sure the acting leader will correct me if I am wrong on that too.

The next point they raise is turning now to section 10(1)(c), which removes the third-party access to TASCAT, and I have referred to this a little bit, but I will read their comments here:

TASCAT review is an important part of our system of checks and balances which ensure appropriate scrutiny of executive decision-making. Public confidence in planning decisions is strengthened by enabling persons who are directly impacted by a project, as well as interested community groups, to seek review of planning decisions by an independent tribunal.

Potential local sensitivity around the building of a youth detention facility strengthens rather than weakens the case for independent oversight. In any event, removing TASCAT review will not remove strong community concerns. These concerns may relate to a whole range of issues that are important to constituents and merits review provides a formal and independent mechanism for considering these.

Now, obviously the appeals are limited. It is not just a free-for-all that we are talking about. There are constraints around that. They go on to say:

There is also a risk that removing third-party appeal may redirect those concerned groups into much longer and more costly judicial review proceedings through the courts, causing much longer delays than a merit review process by TASCAT. Of course, parliament cannot exclude judicial review of the lawfulness of administrative decisions, including planning decisions. The High Court has told us that removing judicial review will allow the executive to determine the limits of its own power. That, in the High Court's words, 'will create islands of power immune from supervision and restraint'. Therefore, it is our view that section 10(1)(c) should be deleted.
I did speak a bit about this. I need some evidence that TASCAT are a problem, in that it would take far too long before we are taking away the rights of people to appeal. Now, I know some of the concerns raised - and I have talked to members of the community in the vicinity of the proposal here. They are concerned about the fact that a youth detention facility near a garden club and a shooting club and a clay pigeon shooting arrangement may be not in the best interest of the young people. I understand that. There is also a medicinal cannabis operation just over the main highway there, which apparently does emit quite an odour at times, but that business is looking at composting rather than burning their residual waste. In any event, some of those things may be able to be mitigated, but the planning scheme looks at the impact of the new development, which would be the youth detention facility, on the neighbours, not the other way round. 

I am not sure exactly how those matters would see light of day in a process of review. I understand the concerns of some of the neighbours around those things and whether or not they can be mitigated, because the facility itself will not be making - well, hopefully not - gunshots on-site and they hopefully will not be burning lots of cannabis either. It is the neighbouring properties that have these other pre-existing uses, if you like. It is a rural area, so you expect sometimes when townies move to the country, they do not like the cows mooing either and complain about that.

The fourth point they make is: 

Finally, we turn to the question whether the minister should be empowered to change key features of the facility.

This is something that did concern me a little bit too. In clause 6(1) of the bill, parliament declares the building of a youth facility so long as it conforms to a maximum floor area, a maximum size for a wastewater facility and a minimum 20-metre setback from the boundary. However, clause 6(2) allows the minister on one or more occasions to change these three important features of the building project. An increase in the gross floor area in particular could lead to the construction of a much bigger facility than is presently contemplated.

Clause 6(2) fails to provide an end point to the exercise of this ministerial power. We are concerned about two things: first, that the capacity for parliamentary oversight and disallowance of possible future ministerial orders is, in practice, limited; particularly given that there can be a considerable gap between the gazetting of the ministerial notice and its tabling in both Houses. We note that in this regard, no justification has been provided for removing the application to the Subordinate Legislation Act 1992.

The key purpose of the Subordinate Legislation Act is to ensure that any impact on the community from subordinate legislation is clearly justified, including through the requirement for a regulatory impact statement. That is not always the case. Sometimes you can get an exemption for that. Where the Treasury determines that there is an impact, there has to be a regulatory impact assessment at that point. More often than not, you get exemptions from that, as the current Chair would understand.

Ms Rattray - Through you, Mr President, the former Chair knows it backwards.

Ms FORREST - Yes that is right. Compliance with the Subordinate Legislation Act's guidelines ensure that the economic, social, environmental costs and benefits of subordinate legislation are made transparent and carefully scrutinised. Under this bill, those important oversight processes are removed. Whilst it is a disallowable instrument, it does not go through another standing committee of this parliament, whose job is to scrutinise subordinate instruments. There are some things that the committee does not scrutinise, and not all orders are scrutinised. 

Ms Rattray - Nationally consistent legislation, you do not. 

Ms FORREST - Yes. All regulations are, obviously. Every time we take something away from a form of parliamentary scrutiny - we had another disallowance motion not so long ago; I asked the chair of the committee, 'Has the Subordinate Legislation Committee considered this regulation yet, because I rely on them to do that work?' If they had done so and were happy with it, then that gives a different perspective, perhaps, than if they had not even had a chance to look at it and a disallowance motion is put on by another member - who has every right to do that, it is not a criticism for doing that. It is just that that interrupts that particular process. They go on to say: 

Secondly, clear decision-making pathways are important in any planning process. It is our view that section 6(2) should, at a minimum, be amended to make it clear that the minister may not change these key features of the facility after the planning authority has been approved and perhaps attached conditions to that development.

I know what the counter argument to that will be, but you never know until you get into a bill what might happen. You might need to adjust something; you might find that there is a bog in that area, and you cannot actually put that thing there, and so you need to amend the floor plan or something like that during the process. It is just this carte blanche approach that you can do almost anything you need to make it be what you want, and then not have further scrutiny or approval by the council, the authority that approved the permit in the first place, and necessarily through the parliament. I am concerned about a number of those things. 

I will listen to other members' contributions, particularly from those who have had much more experience than me. Everyone has had more experience than me, pretty much, who has been in local government, but to hear from those who know how it works in progress - do you hold concerns about that, or am I just being overly pessimistic here? 

I do wonder if there is that middle course, as suggested by the Mayor of the Southern Midlands, Edwin Batt, when he talked about perhaps having a more expedited process through TASCAT for appeals rather than removing the right altogether. I know the government, and the minister particularly, do not want delays to this. None of us do, but we have proper processes and every time we trash them, like with the Stony Rise development, for the benefit of a developer, a donor to members of the Liberal Party, we undermine the very reason we are here.

When we agree to a process in this place, if we do not like the process anymore, we change the process for everyone. Once you start cherrypicking - and we are seeing so much of this at the moment, and that is one of the reasons why there is a trust deficit and a lack of confidence in the government, as we are seeing play out right now in another place, but for me, I am yet to be convinced that the normal planning process should not prevail in this. 

Perhaps there is a need for some mechanism to expedite any appeal through TASCAT, knowing that there are apparently members of the community who are getting their legal advice about what they need to do to appeal. That is their right. They may not even have standing. They may not have a valid appeal to put, but surely if someone does feel aggrieved, they do have standing particularly. To have those rights taken away is deeply concerning, unless there is a really good justification for it.

If the Acting Leader in her reply or other members can convince me that this is a really good idea, then I am happy to reconsider my very deep concern at this point. I have not made a final decision on this bill. I was hoping to have a bit more time to fully consider the matter, and maybe we will overnight, I do not know until what time we intend to sit tonight, but it is ridiculous sitting late when we have a whole day tomorrow.

I have done my best to raise the matters of concern to me. There are a number of areas within the bill that I think do warrant further consideration. That may take some time in the Committee stage, obviously. I know the member for Mersey is looking at one amendment, which I think is eminently sensible, but I think there are others that should be contemplated if this bill is to proceed in some form.

[6.17 p.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY - Mr President, my contribution will only be four or five minutes maximum. First of all, I would like to thank the member for Murchison, who has eloquently raised concerns about appeal rights, TASCAT, development applications, closure of Ashley, models of care, roles of planning authorities, committees, valid concerns over other clauses. I think that was a really good speech and contribution so that we could all hear that.

I also would like to appreciate the briefings that we had today, especially from the two academics from the UTAS School of Law, and also from the Southern Midlands Council. I would like to acknowledge their efforts in trying to help us understand what the concerns may be with this legislation. I think that was good.

Also, my amendment is quite clear: I believe the Public Works Committee does play an important role in scrutinising infrastructure builds and, as the member for Murchison said, we have committees in place that play an important role in the parliamentary process, and the Public Works Committee is that process. I was concerned when I saw the capacity, I think it was in clause 12, where we could delete that and bypass that.

Page 11 of the questions and answers says, 'What is the total estimated cost of the project?'

Approximately $150 million has been allocated in the 2025-26 Budget for the Youth Justice facility. 

The final cost will depend on the completion of detailed design work and procurement. 

And the last one:

The government is committed to ensuring the project delivers value for money, with oversight by relevant agencies and ministers.
That one concerns me a little. We have had recent examples where that ministerial oversight has not been that effective, and we have the Public Works Committee for that role in scrutinising public money, and that is part of their purview.

The amendment is very clear. It just says, 'Vote against the clause.' We could have done that on the Floor of the House anyway and come up to Committee, but I think it is important that we have a detailed conversation about that. I am also interested to see what the government's position would be if we got into the Committee process and we voted against the clause; the government would obviously vote for it. I think once the government hears the concerns that have been raised today, I will be interested to see how they look at that clause.

Like the member for Murchison, I want to listen to other people. I think we put amendments in this place to strengthen legislation. Whether we then vote for or against the legislation is a different thing. What I want to do is when we get to the final draft that has gone through the Committee, then I will make a decision whether I am for it or against it, but what I am saying is that regardless, clause 12 should be deleted so that that aspect of this process does not inhibit us if we do vote in favour of this legislation. I am just doing that speech now in the second reading, so I do not have to do as much in the Committee stage.

[6.21 p.m.]
Ms THOMAS (Elwick) - Mr President, I appreciate the contribution from the member for Murchison and feel a bit the same, quite rushed in this and not as prepared as I would like to be. I will make a couple of key points around my key concerns, which I would really like a bit more time to consider and seek advice on.

First, as the member for Murchison alluded to and I mentioned in the briefing, when someone makes a development application where they are making an application for a use that is not permitted, as is the case in this instance, they will need to make an application for a use and development. To be clear, I think that was the question that the member for Murchison was seeking more information on. From my perspective, the things that I am considering are around the rules for use and the rules for development. I do not have enough clarity as yet on that. What we have heard a lot about in the briefing and in the information that has been provided today is around making this correctional facility a permitted use in the rural zone. It is currently not a permitted use, but it is permitted by discretion.

Under the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993, under our planning scheme as far as I understand it, there are rules for use and rules for development. Under the rules for use, a use class, that is use for a correctional facility, the purpose of a correctional facility, may be permitted, not permitted, or discretionary. In this case, it is discretionary. What we are being asked to do is grant that as a permitted use or grant the ability for the Southern Midlands Council to say that is a permitted use.

What we have not heard much about is the rules for development. Use means using land for a particular purpose, as I just said, corrections facility in this instance. Rules for development relate to the actual development itself on the land, if that use is permitted. Development includes the construction, alteration, or demolition of a building or works and subdivision or consolidation of land.

Under those rules for development, under our planning scheme, a proponent has to demonstrate that the proposed development, the construction of a building on the land or the consolidation of land meets the acceptable solutions. If it meets the acceptable solution, there is no discretion, there are no appeal rights. If an applicant cannot demonstrate they meet the acceptable solution, they need to demonstrate they meet the performance criteria under the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993. The onus is on the applicant to demonstrate they meet these performance criteria. The approval is discretionary and there are appeal rights. What I am lacking information on here and I need more information on and time to consider is the performance criteria in relation to the actual development here.

We asked today in the briefing, how far progressed is the development application? Is it ready to be submitted? We have not seen the development application and from what I can understand, as far as the briefings and the information provided so far goes, we are referring a lot to the use of the land, not so much to the development, but from my understanding, what we are being asked to waive is appeal rights when it comes to both the use and development. That is what I am not clear on, and I really need to be clear on that before I can make an informed decision.

My other key concern is the potential risk of the Southern Midlands Council being subject to Supreme Court litigation, being the decision maker here. In approving use and development for a discretionary development application without appeal rights, we are being asked to pass this legislation due to concerns that an appeal process through TASCAT could delay things, that appeals through TASCAT and then potentially the Supreme Court if further action is then taken, could delay things. As the member for Murchison clearly said, I too, like many others - again, I will not speak for everyone else - think it is fairly well accepted that no-one wants to see the closure of Ashley any further delayed than it already has been.

In a quick Google search I just did, I found that TASCAT must resolve appeals within 90 days, and the average length of time is 80 days. That is not a long period of time, but that is a concern that we are being presented with as a rationale for why we should pass this bill, pretty much put on Southern Midlands Council that they must approve this use and maybe development, I am not clear on that, and potentially waive appeal rights that currently exists under LUPAA.

We heard from those very well-respected legal representatives who came and presented to us earlier today that parliament cannot remove judicial review. In the absence of there being the capacity for people to make representations under the provisions that exist in the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act, they could seek to take legal action through the Supreme Court because that would be the only avenue available to them. If they did this, I expect that this would be a far more complex and lengthy process and costly process than the appeal rights that exist through TASCAT. I have real concern about that risk for Southern Midlands Council as the decision maker because we are being advised parliament is not being asked to be the decision maker here; Southern Midlands Council will be. The government will not be the decision maker; Southern Midlands Council will be.

What is the risk for them? Have they got legal advice around what they are being asked to do here because, potentially, legal action being taken on something like this could really affect the Southern Midlands Council financially and could really hurt the ratepayers of that community. I need to be assured that there is not that risk to the Southern Midlands Council and its ratepayers. 

They are two of the key concerns I have. I have a number of other questions as well. I need more time to consider, so I now move -

That the debate be adjourned until tomorrow.

Debate adjourned.

TasBuild Portable Long Service Leave Fund

[6.29 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, I wish to speak briefly on adjournment, as I advised you.

It is to do with a matter related to TasBuild. The reason I want to read this letter from constituents of mine into Hansard is that this is not the first time I have had similar concerns raised. I will read the letter. It is very self-explanatory and I think it is very concerning. I have the company's permission to use their name - it is Blackley Pipelines & Irrigation - in this contribution:

TasBuild Limited (TasBuild) was created to manage the portable long service fund for eligible workers in the Tasmanian construction industry. The role of TasBuild is to ensure that the fund operates according to the fund rules and the Construction Industry (Long Service) Act 1997. 

Blackley Pipelines & Irrigation Pty Ltd (Blackley) and other local irrigation supply businesses are not engaged in construction. We do, however, assemble pivot and linear irrigators in the field in much the same way as agricultural machinery dealers assemble tedders and other machinery on site. These companies are not subject to the Act. We are only engaged in on-farm infrastructure, however TasBuild claim that we are obliged to contribute to their fund based on their rules (not the legislation) because of a reference to irrigation in the ANZSIC Code.

Section 3 of the Act defines 'construction industry' as 'any industry involved in any construction described in Division C or Division E of the Standard Industrial Classification'. 'Standard Industrial Classification' is defined as meaning the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification issued by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 1993 (ABS Catalogue No. 1292.0)(ANZSIC).

In Blackley's case, we have always reported (in our tax returns and elsewhere) that we fall under Division A of the Australian New Zealand Standard Industry Classification (ANZSIC) and our industry code is 05290. Division A refers to 'other agricultural and fishing support services'. 

Furthermore, the casual long service leave legislation was introduced to provide LSL benefits to employees who by the very nature of the construction industry with its peaks and troughs would rarely stay with one employer long enough to accrue LSL. The irrigation industry is not characterised by short term employment. Our staff turnover is relatively low and staff who do leave do so of their own volition and not due to a downturn in activity. 

In our dispute with TasBuild, we ultimately had to acquiesce to their demands because we lack the financial capacity to fund the legal processes beyond appealing directly to the board of TasBuild. It should be noted that prior to our meeting with TasBuild board members, we were informed that they would come to the meeting with an open mind and that we had the opportunity to put our case and supply any and all evidence to that meeting. Regrettably, one of the board members representing the union movement was not only aggressive in questioning and bordering on 'bullying', he clearly did not come with an open mind, willing to consider our evidence and views. His stated position was simply that Blackley is obliged to contribute, 'no discussion and end of story'. At the time it struck us that this is no way to represent TasBuild to the public. 

Notwithstanding the fact that we took a commercial decision in this matter, we still hold the view that we are not subject to the Construction Industry (Long Service) Act 1997.

Now to other aspects of how TasBuild operates.

An employee of ours commenced working with us in a senior capacity over three years ago and until recently we were unaware his previous employer contributed to TasBuild. TasBuild wrote to our employee enquiring about his current employment. We responded on his behalf, advising TasBuild of when he started and his pay rates at various times during his employment. We calculated that the long service liability for the period from when he commenced until the payment date was $5038.82, however, TasBuild invoiced us $7596, with the only explanation that the calculation was made within their rules. Unfortunately, our employee will not get the benefit of the extra payment. It will simply be absorbed into 'consolidate funds'.

More recently we received a demand to register our employees with TasBuild for their purposes of billing us. As a result, we have been served with an invoice of $108,844.76 in respect of current and former employees. We accrued the actual liability for our field service staff in our financials and that liability is only $65,664.41. In other words, TasBuild is overcharging us $43,1801.35 - 

There might be a typo here. It's roughly $43,000. I think they've got one extra number in there:

Another of our employees for whom we have contributed during the whole of his employment with us had accumulated so-called 10 years of service with TasBuild and claimed his entitlement. He was paid a benefit, however the benefit was calculated in part on his pay rate prevailing in earlier years and not wholly on his current pay rate. Had he accumulated his ten years in service entirely with Blackley we would have paid out his LSL [long service leave] benefit in accordance with the law and calculated it wholly on the current pay rate. 

In our discussions with TasBuild, they informed us that should an employee for whom contributions were made, leave the construction industry for more than 3 years, they will lose their LSL entitlements, unless the employee chooses to make personal contributions to protect their entitlement. 

Mr President, I will just digress briefly from this letter to say that is a terribly gendered disadvantage for women who leave to have a family, have a child, and take time out from the workplace. This legislation must be revisited if this is how it is being applied and how TasBuild are operating. It is unconscionable.

This seems grossly unfair to employers, who contribute in good faith and find that the employee does not get any benefit. Surely, TasBuild could refund at least part of the contributions in cases such as this to the employer. The practice of lost benefit after 3 years absence from the construction industry will impact far more on businesses such as ours than the genuine construction industry, mainly because our employees who do leave of their own volition will in most cases not seek employment in the construction industry and hence all benefits will be lost. 

That is one of the known risks of this legislation, but it certainly disadvantages women far more than men.

TasBuild has made very little attempt to communicate with businesses in the irrigation industry until quite recently. In our meetings with TasBuild they claimed that the industry was a new industry and as such it was its reason for the lack of communication. In reality the industry has been around for at least 50 years or more, which is hardly new. When Blackley's commenced business it had no knowledge of TasBuild or any obligations under the Act to contribute on behalf of employees. Even after Blackley's withdrew its claim to recover funds from TasBuild (which it considers is illegal) TasBuild has made no effort to contact Blackley or visit our premises. This lack of communication or enquiry about our business or explain who amongst our employees is liable, what our obligations are or any other matters pertaining to the legislation is in our opinion a dereliction of duty on their behalf.

In conclusion, we believe there is a serious misunderstanding of the obligations of which businesses are caught by the legislation. By and large the Irrigation Installation and Supply does not see itself as being in the construction industry and the Act itself is known as the Construction Industry (Long Service) Act 1997. It is not the Construction and other Industries Act. Furthermore, it is not the Act itself that TasBuild is relying on to 'rope in' the Irrigation Industry but the Rules of TasBuild. Clearly TasBuild is failing in its obligations to administer the Act in a fair and equitable matter.

It has used its authority in a capricious and dictatorial manner to extend its reach beyond what is within the law or reasonable. Most Tasmanian businesses do not have the financial capacity to pursue legal recourse, certainly we don't and for that reason we had to withdraw.

It has imposed excessive fees on business in the collection of contributions. In our case the charges were 50% greater than the actual liability we were asked to pay.

The benefit payable to the beneficiaries is from our experience, inferior to what an employee would be entitled to under the Long Service Leave Act (1976).

Ministerial oversight should extend to a review of the matters raised above, and excluding the irrigation industry to the extent of 'on farm infrastructure'.

Mr President, I do appreciate your indulgence in that because I think it really points out some of the very real issues with how TasBuild are operating. The intention when we passed that legislation here was not to create a monster like this. It is not the first time I have had interaction for members of my community and other parts of the state who are facing similar challenges. I hope the government will take this forward and ensure that this is properly reviewed.

The Council adjourned at 6.39 p.m.
