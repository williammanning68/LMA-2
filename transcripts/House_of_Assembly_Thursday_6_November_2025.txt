STATEMENT BY SPEAKER

Unparliamentary Language 

 [Bookmark: _Hlk213320196] The SPEAKER -  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=101.8_D=18.8_C=0.87] I want to draw the House's attention to unparliamentary language. I appreciate that we all get very passionate in this place, but I ask members to be mindful of the Motion for Respect report, which highlighted the importance of this Chamber being a safe place for all members.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=122.4_D=8.8_C=0.71] Yesterday, the honourable member for Bass, Ms Finlay, used unparliamentary language during Question Time. I did not hear this at the  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=132.0_D=29.6_C=0.78] time, so I was not able to ask that it be withdrawn, but it has subsequently been raised with me as it does appear on the Hansard record. I have spoken to the honourable member this morning and she has very kindly offered to withdraw the comments. I ask that the honourable member now withdraw this parliamentary language. 

Ms FINLAY - Thank you, honourable Speaker. I withdraw.

The SPEAKER - I remind all members of the requirement to not use unparliamentary language during debate because it could be raised at a later time or in  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=162.0_D=8.4_C=0.67] Hansard, so I prefer that there be minimal instances of this. 


QUESTIONS

Public Service - Potential Job Cuts

Mr WILLIE question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ 

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=172.9_D=12.8_C=0.85] Yesterday, you told this Chamber that you hadn't sacked a public servant. We both know what you meant to say was that you hadn't sacked a Tasmanian public servant yet. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=186.8_D=29.1_C=0.84]  You've proudly boasted about cutting 14,000 public servants from the Commonwealth Public Service when you were a minister in Canberra and now it seems you're about to follow the same playbook in Tasmania. You've made it clear that you believe government should always be on the lookout to reduce the size of government and size of expenditure. You've also said there will be consequences for the size of the workforce if workers don't accept your bad-faith ultimatum and you've refused to rule out job cuts in health and education. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=216.6_D=29.4_C=0.76]  Given your proud record of sacking 14,000 public servants in Canberra, should Tasmanian teachers, nurses and support staff be bracing for the same treatment? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, where the honourable member gets it wrong, as he always does, is that I did not sack a single public servant. We went to the election saying we would engage in natural attrition. In general [Bookmark: Phr12_O=247.0_D=24.0_C=0.74]  terms, there is about a 10 per cent turnover in the public service through deaths - unfortunately - retirement, resignations, et cetera. Then, as those vacancies occur, you manage those vacancies to ascertain where people who might be superfluous in one agency  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=272.1_D=5.0_C=0.76] can be moved over to another vacancy and as a result manage the public service. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=277.8_D=10.4_C=0.87]  There is a big difference between natural attrition and sacking people. When people leave voluntarily or [Bookmark: Phr15_O=289.0_D=10.8_C=0.85] , unfortunately, through their demise, that is not sacking them, so this is yet again another example of the gross distortions that the Australian Labor Party, in this case the Tasmanian Labor Party, engages in to try to make their case, when we as a government are seeking to right-size the public service. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, the honourable Treasurer has the call.
 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=28.3_D=13.6_C=0.90] 
Mr ABETZ - It stands to reason that we would seek to make savings because those over there sent us to an election on the basis of the need for [Bookmark: Phr3_O=42.6_D=29.7_C=0.85]  budget repair. How do you achieve budget repair without making savings or managing the size of the public service? You can manage that carefully, discreetly and sensitively and that is what we, as a government, will be seeking to do. To say and accuse me and the Abbott government at the time of sacking 14,000 public servants - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Interjections will cease. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=72.9_D=28.4_C=0.84]  There's been enough this morning. 

Mr ABETZ - Even when we point out the fact that nobody was sacked but it was through natural attrition, they continue with the interjections to assert that they were sackings. I've just explained that there is a difference between natural attrition and sackings. That is what we did and for the Leader of the Opposition [Bookmark: Phr5_O=101.5_D=24.2_C=0.79]  to come in here, make the false allegations, then have it explained to him and yet double down, is indicative, unfortunately, of the way that the Leader of the Opposition is playing his politics. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Perhaps the Treasurer could explain what he means by consequences for the workforce if they don't comply with his bad-faith ultimatum.

The SPEAKER - Honourable Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ -  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=126.6_D=0.8_C=0.72]  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=128.9_D=29.1_C=0.84] Speaker, let's be very clear, our public servants in Tasmania deserve a pay rise. Nobody argues with that. They need a pay rise and they deserve a pay rise. The discussion that is taking place at the moment is about the extent of the pay rise. Should some of the extravagant claims be made into a reality, there would be consequences because 46 per cent of the State Budg [Bookmark: Phr8_O=158.4_D=18.1_C=0.74] et, virtually half, is spent on public service wages. If those opposite who sent us to an election want there to be budget repair - 

Mr MITCHELL - Point of order, Speaker. I know if you tell a lie often enough it becomes the truth - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER -  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=179.4_D=2.2_C=0.46] I ask the member to withdraw the word 'lie'.

Mr MITCHELL - I withdraw that.

The SPEAKER - What Standing Order [Bookmark: Phr10_O=185.9_D=1.3_C=0.65]  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=187.9_D=20.1_C=0.79]  are you referring to? 

Mr MITCHELL - Two. 

The SPEAKER - Standing Order 2 is Code of Conduct and that is not a point of order. That's a substantive motion. I advise the honourable member to take his seat. Thank you. Your comments are on the record. The minister's time has expired.


 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=210.7_D=3.6_C=0.65]  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=216.9_D=1.8_C=0.50] Greyhound Racing - Legislation to End Industry
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=220.3_D=29.6_C=0.81] 
Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.08 a.m.]
Three months ago you wrote to the North West Greyhound Racing Club and said: 

The government is committed to support the longevity and sustainability of the racing industry which, as you know, generates $208 million in economic activity for Tasmania and which involves 6400 people. [tbc]

Today your Liberal-Greens government will be tabling legislation to shut it down. There's been no consultation about this, absolutely none. The greyhound community is reeling. They've been betrayed by [Bookmark: Phr15_O=250.3_D=13.9_C=0.85]  your sellout to the Greens to keep your own job and there are real concerns about participants' mental health and wellbeing and for their dogs. Can you confirm there's been no consultation about this bill with the racing industry? Did you consult with the Greens on the bill?

ANSWER
 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=265.4_D=1.0_C=0.49]  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=271.1_D=17.3_C=0.69] 
Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. My understanding is that the industry was invited to be on the working group and declined. That's my understanding. We want to ensure that everyone is engaged when it comes to working through what is a complex [Bookmark: Phr18_O=290.3_D=6.3_C=0.85]  transition for the greyhound racing industry with the phasing out of greyhounds in 2029. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=297.7_D=7.3_C=0.88]  There is complexity around industry participants, complexity around animal welfare and ensuring that the animals are cared for in the transition in a humane way, and to ensure we do as much as possible to support the industry in that transition. This has been complex in other jurisdictions, notably New Zealand, that have announced the phasing out of the greyhound industry.

Mr Willie - Why did you write to them before the election?

The SPEAKER - Order. You've asked a question. I ask that the Premier be heard in silence, please.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I recognise that the industry will be extremely disappointed, as I've said openly in parliament and publicly -

Mr Willie - You're the Premier of the state and your word means nothing.

The SPEAKER - Mr Willie, that is the third interjection in this question. I ask that you refrain, otherwise I will have no hesitation to start giving you warnings.

Mr ROCKLIFF - When we announced the phasing out of the greyhound racing industry we said we would table legislation before the end of the year, and today is the day -

Mr Willie - Under the cover of the Budget.

The SPEAKER - This is your first warning.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The first step of phasing out the greyhound racing industry in Tasmania. This also coincides with the deed set up in 2009 when Labor sold the TOTE which we opposed at the time, and sold it for a song, effectively. We're coming up to the expiration of the deed, so any government would be studiously looking at the rollover of the deed and how best to position the racing industry and all the participants -

Mr Winter - You committed to the full deed in every code.

The SPEAKER - Mr Winter, this is your third interjection, too.

Mr ROCKLIFF - but also recognising that the greyhound racing industry is in decline - 

Mr Winter - Rubbish.

The SPEAKER - That's your first warning.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We will work through with the industry to ensure that we support industry participants and, most importantly as we transition, to support the animal welfare aspects as well.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Premier's time has expired. Before I let the honourable Leader of the Opposition speak, I have no hesitation today. I appreciate it's Thursday, everyone's tired, it was a late night last night, but I will issue warnings and I don't mind suspending people. One interjection per question, okay, but if you keep on with repeated interjections, it makes it hard for Hansard to record what is being said. Also, some comments will be recorded that you might not want to see on there. Leader of the Opposition, a supplementary?

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - Honourable Speaker, the Premier has made it clear he didn't consult with the industry. Did he consult with the Greens on the bill?

The SPEAKER - That was part of the original question, Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I understand there was an opportunity for all to be consulted when it comes to the working group. Again we opened the opportunity for the industry to work with the working group -

Mr Willie - So, the Greens were consulted?

The SPEAKER - Mr Willie, this is your second warning.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What's your point, mate? I mean, seriously, we've made the call and in 2029 the greyhound racing industry will cease.


Recreational Hunting on STT Land

Ms BADGER question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

[10.13 a.m.]
Your government has expressed support for opening up hundreds of thousands of hectares of public land for recreational hunting. You know the recreational hunting approach won't effectively reduce the growing and destructive population of invasive species. You are using this excuse as cover to give shooters unfettered access to vast tracts of beautiful native forests and other sensitive landscapes. These are places enjoyed by Tasmanians from all walks of life, where people are working and where tourists are visiting. These are no places for recreational hunting.

As Police minister, you should understand Tasmania is a state that is fiercely passionate about firearms safety, so why are you pushing for Tasmania to take a frightening step back in this critical area?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. People have been able to engage in hunting on Sustainable Timber Tasmania (STT) land for generations. We manage the land for multiple use, whether that's forestry and timber, carbon sequestration, access for beekeepers or recreational activity, just as we do in many of the other parks and public lands in our state. We are committed to getting the balance right for community safety and responsible firearms ownership and hunting is part of the Tasmanian way of life. It's refreshing to be able to have an open and honest conversation about the opportunities hunting provides people as far as being able to access food, get young people off screens and out into bush -

Dr Woodruff - Not on public land where there are tourists.

The SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff, your interjections will cease.

Mr ELLIS - As I've mentioned, we've been hunting on STT lands and other public lands in Tasmania for generations, and do so currently. I understand that in some other jurisdictions a range of different work has been undertaken to continue to modernise and update opportunities so that that can be done even more safely, support shooting and the sport of hunting, and make sure that we get that balance right.

There are some good opportunities for us to do really good customer service. Certainly, some of the processes used in larger states that have been able to bring technology to bear to the way we manage access to lands for recreational hunting are really interesting and exciting. We will continue to work with ministers Pearce and Duigan about bringing together those opportunities. I am grateful for the question and grateful for the work. We certainly support recreational hunting on STT land, just as we have done for generations.


Housing - Empty Homes

PROF RAZAY question to MINISTER for HOUSING and PLANNING, Mr VINCENT

[10.17 a.m.]
A recent report by Anglicare Tasmania has revealed an 88 per cent increase in the number of Tasmanians sleeping rough. Moreover, getting rentals is harder than ever. Recent Cotality data showed that the Tasmania rental market is facing significant pressure, with rising rents and record low vacancy rates. In Launceston, for example, rent increased by 32 per cent, which mean a $122 increase per week compared to five years ago. The vacancy rate dropped from 2.7 to 1.2 per cent. Moreover, the number of listings has decreased by 37 per cent.

Based on 2021 census data, there are an estimated 1500 to 2700 empty homes across Tasmania. What is the government doing to encourage homeowners to make their properties available for rent and help to alleviate the current housing crisis?

The SPEAKER - The honourable member's time has expired. Just a reminder, if your questions go over, the minister does not have to address anything you have said after your time has expired.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I touched on quite a few of those pieces yesterday. Some of the vacancy rates in relation to the homes under control of Homes Tasmania and some of the community housing providers, they like to keep a number of those homes free for rapid housing and emergency. There is a large number of those homes that are under repair or being upgraded That might be thermal upgrades, solar panels, double-glazed windows, or just general carpet and furnishing upgrades. Some are because of vandalism and some because of transitional issues. Some no longer meet residential specifications where the ability may well be, on a small number, to demolish them and build several units to increase the numbers that are there.

A couple other things I didn't mention yesterday that we are working on and that's the letter of expectations to Homes Tasmania. I have signed off on the draft and I will hopefully be finalising that in the next couple of days. This will bring a lot more focus on the information from the information from the Crawford report back to the board and the administration of Homes Tasmania to increase the focus on delivery. I made no secret yesterday that I'm not comfortable where we're at in some of the processes at the moment, and that my displeasure has been passed on quite bluntly to the Chair, through to the board, and to the administration of Homes Tasmania, that we need to do better. There are a lot of little things in there, as I touched on in my last couple of replies, we need to do better and we have to do that much better as a community and encourage all parts of it. 


Greyhound Racing Industry - Legislation to End Industry

Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for RACING, Ms HOWLETT.

[10.20 p.m.]
Today you will table a bill to shut down greyhound racing. It is a shocking betrayal. For your entire career you said you were a champion for the greyhound industry. They trusted you with their industry and with their vote, yet you sold every single one of them out in a deal with the Greens. What do you say to the greyhound community today? Will you apologise to them for selling them out, and what do you say to the rest of the racing industry?

When the Premier is asked to shut down harness and thoroughbred racing by the Greens and Independents, will you stand with them, or will you sell them out like you did greyhounds? What consultation has been undertaken with the industry in relation to the bill that you will table today?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, the government is getting on with the job to deliver our commitment to phase-out racing in Tasmania by 30 June 2029.

Ms Finlay - Shame.

Mr Winter - Shame. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable minister has only been speaking for 15 seconds. You do not know what words she is going to say. I at least ask that you show some respect to the minister and allow her to get some of her answer on the record before you start calling out immediately in the first five seconds.

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Speaker, I'd like clarification on something you said earlier this morning. You said we could say 'shame' or 'hear, hear'.

The SPEAKER - Yes, but after five seconds of her response is a little bit - 

Members interjecting.

Ms Finlay - Her opening is a shame, Speaker.

The SPEAKER - Order. You can say 'shame', but I do ask that some courtesy is shown to members in this House where you at least allow them to give some sort of response instead of calling 'shame' right from the first few words. You do not know what the minister is about to say. 

Ms HOWLETT - The government has been clear since we announced the decision that we intended to introduce the legislation this year. We're getting on with the job to deliver a measured, sensible phase-out of greyhound racing with appropriate scrutiny through the parliamentary committee and in this place on the pathway forward.

I confirm that I will be appearing before the committee tomorrow to outline the approach. I understand and appreciate that there will be many in the racing industry who are upset with this decision. The independent Tasmanian Racing Integrity Commissioner, Mr Sean Carroll, is developing a comprehensive plan to deliver all operational animal welfare and integrity components of the transition. This work is already underway.

The Joint Parliamentary Committee will provide parliamentary scrutiny and public accountability for the work being undertaken by the commissioner. The commissioner would provide regular reports as required to the committee. The commissioner's Greyhound Racing Transition Working Group has also provided valuable input into the legislation-drafting process from its community discussions and feedback. The government intends to continue progressing the legislation to ensure that the important changes to safeguard animal welfare can be made in a timely fashion.

We will ensure that officials from NRE Tasmania, together with the commissioner, will be available to provide briefings for members of parliament and stakeholders on the legislative-drafting progress to date. As we deliver a measured and sensible phase-out of greyhound racing, I want to be clear on my support for the broader racing industry, its participants, and our regional communities. 

The SPEAKER - The honourable minister's time has expired. 

Supplementary question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - In relation to the minister's response, how could anyone in the broader racing community have any faith in this minister or this government to keep the other two codes going when they have so shamelessly shut down greyhound racing after having promised to keep it going?
———————————————————
Recognition of Visitors

The SPEAKER - I acknowledge in the House, year five and six students from Latrobe Primary School. We will have a second cohort coming in, in the next couple of minutes. Thank you.

Members - Hear, hear.
———————————————————
Ms HOWLETT - As I said, I want to be very clear on my support for the broader racing industry -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Interjections will cease. The honourable minister is the only one who has the call at this present time. 

Ms HOWLETT - its participants and our regional communities.


Firearms Laws - Recreational Deer Hunting

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[10.25 a.m.]
Yesterday both the Labor and Liberal parties supported expanding shooters' access to public land, a frightening sop to the gun lobby. Today your Police minister has backed in that same sentiment. More disturbing, silencers and semi-automatic weapons were even discussed as options for hunting. Let's be clear, these would be a big step backwards on community safety and would violate the National Firearms Agreement. Will you rule this out or do you want to be the premier who weakens Tasmania's gun laws?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. It's about ensuring we get the balance right for the environment, in this case the substantive debate and discussion yesterday was about deer management, which is, as you know, very complex with a whole range of stakeholders. How do I know it's complex? I was minister for prime industries trying to herd all the cats for years and there are a lot of different opinions when it comes to deer management in terms of the hunting fraternity, the people who want to have the meat for sale, deer farmers, a whole range of stakeholders, so I welcome the discussion from Mr Di Falco in trying to navigate what is very complex.

I agree with the honourable member, Ms Badger, when she talks about deer as a biosecurity issue. I know you're surprised I agree with you, I know that, but it is a biosecurity issue, and there are various stakeholders we need to work through.

I wish 100 years ago we didn't introduce blackberries, rabbits, gorse, crack willows - all these invasive species, including deer. As a fundamental believer in strong biosecurity practice, that was not good biosecurity practice because now we're paying for it in many ways, whether it's deer, weeds, crack willows - all the areas that I've just mentioned. It is important we try and navigate our way through this in terms of deer management and also listen to all stakeholders. I believe you are not incorrect, honourable leader, in linking the two when it comes to firearms and strong deer management in the context that you have had question.

The government is committed to focusing on and reducing firearms crime and violence in Tasmania. Incidents involving firearms are very concerning, and Tasmania Police is committed to ensuring illegal firearms activities are eliminated in our communities and we make no apologies for being tough on gun crime.

The Firearms Amendment (Community Safety) Act 2023 commenced in the back end of 2024, with a number of changes now implemented. These amendments target people who threaten Tasmania's safety through their illegal or unsafe behaviour with firearms and we're also ensuring that police have the authority to stamp out any criminal activity and penalise those who threaten our safety.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - My question was not about deer management; it was about the use of silencers and semi-automatic weapons. I'm sure you would remember the 2018 firearm inquiry that heard overwhelming evidence from doctors, from farmers and from victim-survivors of gun violence that we should strengthen the firearms agreement and hold to the National Firearms Agreement. Will you commit to no weakening of the National Firearms Agreement, including any allowance for silencers and semiautomatic weapons in Tasmania? 

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=22.2_D=27.0_C=0.76] There are national firearms laws which we don't intend to weaken at all. The context of suppressors is about the control of game and allowing farmers the tools to control - 

Dr Woodruff - That is in violation of the National Firearms Agreement. 

The SPEAKER - Order, Dr Woodruff.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is about balance and having the tools to be able to -

Dr Woodruff - Balance doesn't mean breaking.

The SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff, that's the second time you've interjected. I ask that the Premier be heard.

Mr ROCKLIFF - [Bookmark: Phr3_O=49.7_D=11.2_C=0.91]  It's about balance when it comes to allowing farmers - through discussion, and there's a lot of discussion to have within this context [Bookmark: Phr4_O=63.0_D=16.8_C=0.73]  - the tools to protect their crops and this is one such tool in terms of suppressors, but we remain steadfastly committed to the integrity of the National Firearms Agreement. 


Macquarie Point Stadium - Economic Benefits

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=82.8_D=27.8_C=0.81] Ms JOHNSTON question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[10.31 a.m.] 
Yesterday on Facebook, you said investing in infrastructure like the stadium creates economic growth that funds services such as health, education and police, but you were in the same briefing as me when Treasury boss Gary Swain said: 

Economic growth doesn't necessarily generate government revenue. It mostly turns into money for private business operators. It does not flow to [Bookmark: Phr6_O=110.9_D=16.7_C=0.80]  Treasury coffers. [tbc]

Why do you continue to claim that private economic growth pays for public hospitals and schools? Isn't it true these projects mainly deliver profits to private businesses, while Tasmanians are left with debt and cuts to jobs and services? 

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=129.6_D=10.3_C=0.74] Honourable Speaker, we know that Ms Johnston, the member for Clark, has been against the stadium from day one. I appreciate and recognise that [Bookmark: Phr8_O=140.2_D=8.1_C=0.88] . In relation to the briefing provided by the secretary of Treasury, he did have that important caveat [Bookmark: Phr9_O=148.8_D=28.7_C=0.87]  'does not necessarily', which means that it can and therefore you can't discount that. Growing the economic pie is part and parcel of this government strategy in trying to right-size the public spending in this state. There is no doubt that if you engage in more economic activity in the state [Bookmark: Phr10_O=177.6_D=14.6_C=0.83]  there is likely to be a greater payroll, therefore there's the likelihood of a greater dividend from payroll tax. If people come to this state because they have jobs with the AFL or the Tasmania Devils [Bookmark: Phr11_O=192.4_D=25.2_C=0.78] , they will be paying stamp duty on the houses they purchase, and so you have all these spinoffs that you cannot discount or ignore. Also, with the stadium proposal. there is no doubt that we will see an influx of capital to build the necessary hotel accommodation. There will b [Bookmark: Phr12_O=218.4_D=4.4_C=0.87] e sponsorship deals that will deliver money to Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr13_O=223.3_D=29.8_C=0.83] , and so there are whole host of areas that will generate economic activity. 

You suggest that somehow the stadium will not benefit the economy. I can understand you might be against it, you might have other priorities, I appreciate that, but you cannot deny the incontrovertible, which is that there will be an economic stimulus and when there is economic stimulus in the state, even if people [Bookmark: Phr14_O=253.3_D=23.4_C=0.79]  get more jobs, that means less pressure on our welfare agencies. The spinoffs are right across the board and that is why we as the government support the stadium for a whole host of reasons, but the economic stimulus is just one of them.


Tyndall Ranges - Next Iconic Walk
 
Ms BADGER question to MINISTER for PARKS, Mr DUIGAN

[10.31 a.m.]
Parks have open public the public comment period on the proposed Tyndall Hut walk. That's despite there being hundreds of pages of documents to read for the public to make comment on, but there's only four weeks to do so. Other far less contentious projects that have also been simpler have had six weeks. The 2021 feasibility study that Tasmanians are being asked to make comment on is actually not present for the proposal that is before them. It doesn't include the track changes, the additional huts that are being built, changed market demand for such walking products, and nowhere have you considered inflation from the outdated $40 million price tag. Will you extend the public comment period to a fair six-week timeframe and what is the new estimated price tag for the walk that is actually being proposed?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question and ongoing interest in Tasmania's outstanding walking products. I would say that it is one of our great offerings and has continued to be promoted, whether it be those back-country walks that I know the member is very fond of, or some of our overnight walks which are renowned, not just here in the state or nationally, but around the world.

We have the Overland Track and the Three Capes Track, and we know that the visitors who come to Tasmania to participate in those walks are the sorts of visitors we want to attract. They stay here for a long period of time before and after the walk. We know those walks sell out in a very short space of time and we would expect the next iconic walk on the west coast of Tasmania to have a similar impact, but a really profound impact on the west coast and our regional economies in that area. I know there is a great deal of excitement on the west coast as we approach the next iconic walk and the build and delivery of that process.

As I say, 93 per cent of Three Capes Track walkers surveyed say they would come back and do a similar style of walk in Tasmania if there were the opportunity to do so. I know there has recently been some further alignment of the camping aspect of the walk to make that align with the hut stay aspect of the walk so that both walking groups in that space get the same type of experience.

Over 50 routes were considered, and I know the Greens had a proposal in that space for what I believe was a 10-day walk in the Tyndall range but we have settled on our three-day walk. In terms of consultation, over 1900 people were consulted in our survey during the feasibility study stage of the project and an additional 2210 people were surveyed in October 2024 to test various aspects of the concept design that had been redefined since the feasibility study.

In response to feedback from the public and following more detailed market research, PWS made a number of changes to the plans, as I mentioned, and these were made public during 2024. There was consultation on the changes to design, the public consultation sessions were clear and we've listened and acted.

The SPEAKER - The honourable minister's time has expired.

Supplementary Question

Ms BADGER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms BADGER - Just back to the original question - other far simpler projects have had a four-week public comment period. Will you extend this one for a fairer six weeks for the thousands of pages of documents? I note in the minister's own words that the project has been refined since the feasibility study, so what is the cost of the project now that has been refined? I don't mean the $40 million price tag from 2021. It's 2025. There is no project that has been immune to inflation in this state since that time, so what is the new cost?

The SPEAKER - Honourable minister, the six weeks and costs due to inflation were part of the original question.

Mr DUIGAN - We have a large, significant budget allocation of $40 million to deliver the next iconic walk and, as I say -

Ms Badger - But how much will it cost? Where's the extra money going to come from? Are you going to take it out of the Parks budget, minister?

The SPEAKER - Order. The only one who has the call is the minister.

Mr DUIGAN - we are committed to this project and we will continue to deliver it. In terms of the public consultation period, I would be happy to have a look at that and report back to the House.


Housing - Rapid Response Program

Ms BROWN question to MINISTER for HOUSING and PLANNING, Mr VINCENT

[10.40 a.m.]
This week, Anglicare Tasmania released a damning report into your government's appalling record in providing secure roofs over Tasmanians' heads. I know you will agree with me that mothers and their children escaping family and sexual violence situations are among our most vulnerable Tasmanians. Your government made a commitment in the 2024-25 state budget to expand the number of properties in the Family Violence Rapid Rehousing Program to 150 properties. However, Anglicare reports that the number of properties in this program is actually going backwards and has fallen to just 42 properties. The housing wait lists are growing and our most vulnerable are paying the price. What reassurances can you give those people today that you will reach your target -

The SPEAKER - The honourable member's time has expired.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for that very well-rehearsed question -

Members interjecting.

Mr VINCENT - I have touched on this a fair bit over the last couple of days -

Ms BROWN - Speaker, I ask that the member withdraw. I take offence to that. That's ridiculous.

The SPEAKER - I ask the minister to withdraw.

Mr VINCENT - I withdraw, thank you, Speaker.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The minister has withdrawn. I ask that the minister to continue. 

Members interjecting

The SPEAKER - Order. The only one speaking at the moment is me. Now the minister has the call.

Mr VINCENT - Thank you. We have talked about the Anglicare report a fair bit the last couple of days and I acknowledge that the figures aren't what we expect, and the growing numbers. It is a national and international problem. I have acknowledged that. We are doing our best -

Ms Brown - Your government has made promises to these people.

The SPEAKER - Ms Brown, you have asked a question. I ask that you allow the minister to answer. He still has two minutes. You do not know what he is about to say.

Mr VINCENT - I am meeting with Anglicare to work through these figures because some of the figures I have been given from Homes Tasmania on the various forms of housing and what the member has raised with me are different. There has been an increase in women with children into care and I would like to understand that a lot better. I am meeting with Anglicare to work through those figures.

I have already committed to doing everything I possibly can. I mentioned that we are taking steps, even dragging the board in for out-of-session meetings tomorrow to understand some of the seriousness of this situation. I will continue to work through these issues.

Supplementary Question

Ms BROWN - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms BROWN - What reassurances can the minister give that he will reach the target of 150 properties in this program?

The SPEAKER - That figure of 150 houses was mentioned in the original question.

Mr VINCENT - I'd love to live in a world where assurances can be guaranteed, but they can't be -

A member - It's a government target.

Mr VINCENT - Targets are exactly that: targets. I have given my word that I am doing everything possible to get to that with a team -

Ms Brown - Every woman that approaches my office for housing at the Rapid Rehousing Program -

Mr VINCENT - and the interjections can continue as much as they like -

The SPEAKER - Order. Member for Franklin, you can ask another question. Allow the minister to respond in respectful silence, please.

Mr VINCENT - My response has been for several of these questions. I have given my personal commitment to everybody in this House. We are all part of being elected to govern in this state in one way or another. It is interesting that not one suggestion has come from anybody other than, 'What are you doing about it?'. I have given my commitment as the new minister to do something about it. My commitment is there.


Oral Health Tasmania

Ms ROSOL question to HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mrs ARCHER

[10.44 a.m.]
Many Tasmanians cannot afford private dental care and rely on services at Oral Health Tasmania. The wait times they are enduring are truly terrible. One person was told they might have to wait up to five years for a regular check-up. Another has waited over four years for dentures. Another has given up on getting any dental care at all, all while finding it hard to eat and feeling too embarrassed to smile. Poor dental health can also lead to heart infections and other serious health problems. Timely dental care is critical for health and wellbeing. Yet while your government pours all its energy and money into a stadium, almost 11,000 people are waiting for a dental appointment and 1200 are waiting for dentures. 

Minister, how many teeth have to unnecessarily fall out before you do what it takes to fix oral health services?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Bass for her question. I also thank Ms Rosol for her direct advocacy in this space on behalf of her constituents. Our government is investing in oral health services and is committed to ensuring Tasmanians can gain access to the dental care they need sooner. The 2024-25 budget included investment of $4 million over two years to provide an additional 20,000 dental appointments. These 20,000 extra dental appointments are for general dental care, emergency dental care, and urgent dental and denture care for adults, children and young people. This investment is working. We are delivering a record level of dental appointments and reducing waiting lists.

For the 2024-25 financial year, the Department of Health has provided 11,723 general dental care appointments; 13,921 denture care appointments; 30,624 emergency and urgent dental appointments without patients going on a waiting list; and 42,655 appointments to children and adolescents without patients going on a waiting list. The oral health waiting list for general care for adults in September 2025 was 10,726, but this is below the September 2024 waiting list of 13,715. In September 2025, there were 15,007 general care occasions of service for adults, an average of 50.2 appointments per day. Occasions of service for children also increased to 4232 in September 2025, which is 13.6 per cent higher than in September last year.

We acknowledge that there is more work to do. That is why we are getting on the job of delivering more of these health services Tasmanians rely on.


Industrial Commission - Delay in Decision

Mr O'BYRNE question to ATTORNEY-GENERAL, Mr BARNETT

[10.47 p.m.]
The Tasmanian Industrial Commission is a place where employees go to seek some form of justice and to resolve workplace disputes. Its procedure is designed to be quick, easy and effective. The recent experiences of a worker in my electorate have been anything but. This particular worker has been waiting for more than two years for the commission to deliver a decision in what is, in my opinion, a fairly straightforward matter.

This worker, despite repeated attempts, has not been able to get a progress update from the commissioners. When I wrote to you raising this issue, minister, you indicated it was a matter for the commission. After I personally wrote to the commission, I was informed that this matter was now a priority. How can you justify this delay and the dismissive indifference shown to this Tasmanian worker, a worker who was simply seeking a resolution to their issue?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I appreciate his correspondence on this matter. As the honourable member has indicated, I responded accordingly and noted that the Tasmanian Industrial Commission is an independent entity established by this parliament and they have important work to do.

You have indicated that you followed my suggestion, which was to write to the Tasmanian Industrial Commission on behalf of your constituent to seek their views directly, as it is an independent commission.

You have indicated that you still believe the response needs improving. I take that on board, I appreciate your feedback and I have engaged directly with the Tasmanian Industrial Commission from time to time. I accept that improvements can be made. I hope the Tasmanian Industrial Commission notes that point. Like you and other members in this parliament, I hope that we can all achieve continual improvement, including independent entities such as the Tasmanian Industrial Commission.


TasTAFE - Course Cuts

Mr GEORGE question to MINISTER for SKILLS and JOBS, Mr ELLIS 

[10.50 a.m.]
Tasmania has a thriving and vital creative community that contributes greatly to Tasmania's economy and its reputation as a creative state. TasTAFE has been offering crucial creative pathways, especially for women, older learners and people from marginalised and disadvantaged backgrounds. Digital and creative skills are absolutely essential for anyone in the 21st century workforce, from trades to commerce to the public sector. Now the government wants to snuff out nine TasTAFE creative courses just to dig itself out of a debt crisis, yet teachers and unions contradict the minister's assertions that these courses aren't delivering. They're mostly full or oversubscribed. The Design Institute of Australia is appalled, and these courses will not be replaced by the University of Tasmania or private institutions. Will the minister intervene to reverse this damaging decision? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I appreciate the question from the member for Franklin. We need to ensure that when we're delivering funding and training for people to get a vocational education that is delivering great outcomes for that learner, most importantly, and then more broadly across the system, and we need to ensure that we're getting good value for money for taxpayers. 

Across the 12 courses that TasTAFE has identified as having unsustainably low numbers and very poor completions or high dropout rates, we have projected completion of only 137 learners across those 12 courses for the last year. Some of the courses, as I mentioned in a response to the Independent member for Bass, have a dropout rate of about 75 per cent. That tells us that the learner experience is not delivering. It's not delivering for that learner and it's not getting good value for the taxpayer, so it's important that when we are deciding where taxpayer resources go, we make sure they're going to training organisations and training courses that are putting the learner at the centre and delivering great outcomes.

More broadly, what we've said is that we'll be working with specialised training institutions and organisations who are closely aligned with the industry often and are delivering good outcomes for their courses. I spoke yesterday about some of the opportunities and some of the existing current providers who are delivering really good outcomes in these courses. What we can't allow to happen is for TasTAFE to be all things to all people and duplicating effort in a way that's not delivering strong and good outcomes.

Through the funding provided for TasTAFE we intend to continue that funding. This does not mean funding will be reduced to TasTAFE, it means it will be reprioritised into areas that we know are highly in demand and certainly have strong needs and great outcomes.

I've spoken about the importance of the care economy as we have an ageing population, and potentially there will be universal childcare coming in the future. In building and construction we need to deliver 1.2 million new homes across our country and certainly 10,000 social and affordable homes here in Tasmania, and there is a range of other industries from advanced manufacturing to agriculture. We want to ensure that TasTAFE is that engine room that's continuing to grow. We've delivered an additional $118 million to TasTAFE through this government and we're keen to continue that investment.

You mentioned digital skills. We believe that is a very strong area of growth and potential opportunity for TasTAFE and right across our skills system and you'll see digital skills prioritised right across our skills plan to deliver skills for jobs to help learners to succeed and to deliver on a stronger and joined-up system.

The SPEAKER - The honourable minister's time has expired.

Mr GEORGE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr GEORGE - Is the minister aware that rather than dropping out, a lot of these students are actually moving on to other jobs? Is he aware that the Design Fundamentals class has 50 students and is full; Screen and Media has 40 students, two courses, classes full; Visual Arts, Hunter Street, 20 students, classes full -

The SPEAKER - Mr George, your comments are now on the Hansard record, but that is in effect a new question and is not a supplementary question.


Budget - Public Sector Jobs

Mrs GREENE question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ
 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=14.4_D=28.1_C=0.83] 
[10.55 a.m.]
You have described today's Budget as an interim budget that will enable the continued provision of essential services to the Tasmanian community. Can you provide a clear assurance that essential funding for Tasmania's community services industry will continue, and the jobs of 28,000 Tasmanians employed in this sector are safe? Can you confirm that your interim budget arrangements will not result in service reductions [Bookmark: Phr3_O=42.8_D=4.7_C=0.72] , contract delays or uncertainty for community organisations?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=52.6_D=20.3_C=0.77] Honourable Speaker, I love the build-up and the anticipation for the delivery of the Budget at 3.00 p.m. this afternoon and I thank Mrs Greene for her contribution to building up that anticipation. The Budget will be delivered at 3.00 p.m. this afternoon and all will be revealed then. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=74.4_D=16.7_C=0.86]  

In relation to right-sizing the public service, what I've said at all times is that we want to seek to deliver to the very best of our ability and look to see where savings can be made. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=91.7_D=16.6_C=0.86]  The approach I'm taking is to see whether we can have a Tasmanian State Service spending challenge where public servants would be asked for their ideas on how to save money and deliver services in a more efficient way. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=108.3_D=24.4_C=0.82]  Who do I quote from? Why did I look down to read? It was nothing else but a statement from the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dean Winter, when he was running for the seat of Hobart. Remember when he was born in Hobart? He is now on the record [Bookmark: Phr8_O=133.7_D=4.3_C=0.80]  as saying that that is an appropriate approach. When we adopt it, we get these criticisms and the continual whingeing and whining of those opposite. They come up with no solutions. 

Mrs GREENE - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. I was asking about funding for community services organisations and so far I haven't heard any assurances at all from the minister in relation to my question.

The SPEAKER -  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=168.6_D=27.4_C=0.84] I draw the Treasurer's attention to the original question.

Mr ABETZ - In relation to the original question, I indicated to the honourable member that she would have to wait until 3.00 p.m. this afternoon when the Budget is delivered and all the relevant budget papers are made available. Indeed, I understand the opposition will get a bit of a sneak preview in a budget lockup before that time.

Recognition of Visitors

The SPEAKER - I would like us all to welcome the years 5-6 students from Latrobe Primary School, the second cohort this morning. Welcome to parliament.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=209.5_D=4.4_C=0.44] TasTAFE - Course Cuts

Mr MITCHELL question to MINISTER for SKILLS and JOBS, Mr ELLIS

[10.58 a.m.]
Molly, Hania. Glen, Tanya, Raquel, Jennifer, Tanya, Tony, Melissa, Nanda, Miriam, Maree, Ludmilla, Claire, Sponina, Laura, Zhu, Beck and Celeste are all graduates of TasTAFE's Laboratory Techniques course and are all now working as laboratory technicians [Bookmark: Phr14_O=241.3_D=3.4_C=0.65] , teachers' assistants, laboratory managers and technical officers. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=245.4_D=29.7_C=0.81]  Are these people experiencing what you call 'poor life outcomes', a term you have used to justify cutting subsidies to 12 TasTAFE courses, including lab-tech?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. I think in the three and a half years I've been Minister for Skills and Jobs, this is the first question from the Labor Party on skills and training [Bookmark: Phr16_O=275.2_D=18.8_C=0.83] , so congratulations to you, Mr Mitchell, for your belated interest at least. As I mentioned before - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, the only one who has the call at the moment is the honourable minister. You can ask a supplementary and you still have one more question that can be asked. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=294.5_D=10.0_C=0.73]  

Mr ELLIS - Thank you, Speaker. I was asked about lab-tech training. As I mentioned before in response to a question from the member for Bass previously, the two lab-tach training courses that TasTAFE provide do have very low numbers of students, and sadly, in some cases, a very high dropout rate. We've seen about a 60 per cent dropout rate, and in one case, less than a handful of completions for one of these courses. 

It is also an area where there is training provided by others. There are specialised registered training organisations that specifically provide lab tech training. In fact, one of them is called Lab Tech Training and they provide specialised services to the learners, they provide training and assessment in their workplaces, and deliver a significant number of training outcomes. When I speak about the need for making sure that TasTAFE is not duplicating effort, and that it's not being all things to all people in areas where they have low training outcomes, in areas where they have high dropout rates, in areas where the course numbers are unsustainably low for TasTAFE as an institution, then our commitment is to making sure that that training is provided and subsidies are provided to those courses, but through specialised training organisations that can help address the fact that Tasmania is a thin market where we have very low numbers. 

We are very experienced in terms of being able to support those learners to go through with their training through specialised institutions. That's really our focus in terms of these reforms. TasTAFE have identified these 12 courses -

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Speaker. I take personal offence to something that the minister said on his feet. For one, he was unparliamentary in his response to Mr Mitchell asking a question, saying that he'd come belatedly to the issue. He's a new member of this place and I think that's not fair. I ask the minister to withdraw, I take personal offence - I have personally asked questions about skills, about TAFE, about training in the agricultural space. I know other members of place as well - 

The SPEAKER - You should have called point of order at the time. He was not directly offending - 

Ms FINLAY - I was actually fact-checking, because on my feet in this place, I like to tell the truth. I have asked questions. I ask the minister to withdraw because I take offence to that. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The honourable minister's time has expired. Order. There was no direct personal offence. 

Ms FINLAY - He was untrue about something that I have done. He should withdraw. If you're maintaining standards here - I take personal offence - 

The SPEAKER - Ms Finlay, you can do a substantive motion if you like, where you can put the evidence on the record as to what has happened, or you can raise it on Adjournment. 

Supplementary Question

Mr MITCHELL - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr MITCHELL - Speaker, the minister did not come close to answering my question. Are these people experiencing what he has called 'poor life outcomes', the justification he has used to cut subsidies to 12 TasTAFE courses including Lab Tech?

The SPEAKER - Honourable minister.

Mr ELLIS - As I specifically mentioned before, Mr Mitchell, when we have courses that have very low enrolments, unsustainably low enrolments, less than a handful of graduations, in some of these cases - 

Mr Mitchell - Not true.

Ms Finlay - That isn't true.

The SPEAKER - Order. Mr Mitchell and Ms Finlay, the minister is on his feet. He's giving a reply. If you do not agree with what the minister is saying, there are other forms of the House which you can use, including adjournment or a substantive motion. I ask the minister to continue. Interjections will cease.

Mr ELLIS - Thank you, Speaker. Mr Mitchell has seen the kind of investments we're putting in; the expanded Alanvale Health Hub - which he was invited to the other day - $7.5 million; a new learner centre; new courses that are being stood up; Certificate IV in Mental Health Peer Support. Mr Mitchell, if I were you, I'd be very careful at the moment with your behaviour, because it was noted by journalists on that day, the way that you carried on. 

Members interjecting.

Mr ELLIS - You are well noted for your very poor and unparliamentary behaviour and very poor behaviour with members of the media, Mr Mitchell, so I would be thinking a fair bit -

The SPEAKER - The honourable minister's time has expired.


Public Transport Services

Mr Di FALCO question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

I can't travel anywhere in my electorate without hearing about the state of public transport. I understand that public transport is expensive to operate, however this is a crucial community service. There are children struggling to get to school or university. Councils are committed to working with you. What is your plan to fix this?

ANSWER

I thank the honourable member for his question and understand the sentiment behind the question. First, honourable Speaker, can I welcome the students from Latrobe Primary School? Go the Demons. It's fantastic that you can be here to witness democracy in action and the great behaviour of everyone here today.

I answered a question similar to this just yesterday when I spoke of trying to ensure that we shift - the modal shift, if you like - from cars to public transport in the context of Prof Razay's question. I believe that there is some success with that when it comes to rural and regional areas with the half-price bus fares. I'm aware of circumstances, particularly from the Huon Valley into the city here at Hobart, as an example to that. It's a cost-of-living measure and trying to shift people from cars to public transport. I mentioned the Derwent ferries as well.

We are doing all we can to invest in and trying to provide an increasingly better service when it comes to public transport. The most important thing, as I recall and understand in terms of the success of public transport, is the accessibility in terms of cost, which is very clear, but also reliability and consistency are key factors. What I mean by that is, that when people expect a bus to arrive at 10.30 a.m., the bus is there at 10.30 a.m. If it is not then people lose faith in terms of that reliability and consistency and there may be needed improvements in that area, albeit the good work of our bus operators and indeed Metro and other service providers as well. 

I will take your question on notice in terms of understanding matters that are concerning you within your electorate, and I would be willing to engage with you in terms of any particular routes that you would like to explore in terms of your constituency across what is a very large electorate of Lyons.


Pothole Blitz - Statistics and Budget

 Ms DOW question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.08 a.m.]
I warmly welcome the students from Latrobe Primary School this morning. 

it's now over a year since you announced your pothole blitz. You donned the high-viz, you held a tamper, and you even made sure the media were there to take some photos of your filling one. As anyone who has driven our roads in the last 12 months knows, they've actually got worse since then. You said you were going to fix Tasmania's roads, and you were going to fill those potholes and you haven't. When is your pothole blitz actually going to start? How many did you fill last year? Will you rule out cutting the budget for road maintenance in your bailout budget today?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question and the great interest that you have in this particular area. No doubt our students from Latrobe took great notice of the roads on their way down as well, maybe the Bridgewater Bridge, but there are areas around Parramatta Creek that, of course, I'd have to say, are frustrating for many commuters. I've said this before on a number of occasions: water is the enemy of pavement. We've just been through some very heavy rainfall, particularly in certain areas of the state and the north-west, and that creates -

Members interjecting.

Mr Willie - He's saying the roads aren't built for our weather.

A member - Hydro said it's the driest in years.

Mr Abetz - It has been but it's now rainy. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - It has rained a lot in recent times, but you may not have got to the -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr Mitchell - Great comfort to people whose cars are being wrecked.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thanks, Brian.

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable Premier is the only one who should be speaking right now.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I know our minister has taken great interest in this matter in engaging with civil contractors and experts within the field and the department as well. The 2025-26 Budget we presented earlier this year included significant funding for road maintenance investment across Tasmania. That was rejected by the honourable members opposite when they forced a Tasmanian election. However, that budget investment followed a -

Ms DOW - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The Premier's being untruthful again in this place, but my point of order is in relation to the question, which was how many potholes did he actually fill and he hasn't answered that yet.

The SPEAKER - That that was part of the original question, Premier.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, the Premier has the call.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Over the past 12 months there have been times when significant potholes have occurred on the Bass Highway in the north-west, exacerbated by severe weather, as I've said before. More than 80 sites statewide are planned for resurfacing as part of the 2025-26 summer road maintenance program which helps keep the state road network safe, reliable and well maintained for all road users. Since July 2025 -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time has expired.

Supplementary Question

Ms DOW - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms DOW - I have a supplementary because the Premier didn't really answer my question. When will this pothole blitz actually commence and how many did he actually fill?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Premier. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the honourable member for her question. I learnt a lot on that particular day in terms of pothole maintenance and the like.

Mr Mitchell - Embarrassing.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you very much, Brian - happy chap that you are.

Since July 2025 we've filled 311 of 320 identified potholes on the Ridgley Highway, for example, which is another area of concern. I can provide the honourable member information on other areas in terms of pothole maintenance. I know the minister for Infrastructure has this well and truly in hand. I acknowledge the challenges in this particular area and the frustration for many commuters, particularly after a deluge of very heavy rain.

Mr Willie - Speaker, is he taking that on notice?

The SPEAKER - Order. I suggest you take that question up during Estimates.

Mr Willie - He said he would come back. I was asking for clarification.

The SPEAKER - As you all well know, if members are not satisfied with the minister's answer, there are other forms of the House that are available to them. I cannot require a minister to answer the question in a particular way. The Premier has taken his seat. If you're not satisfied, there are other forms of the House. Mr Garland has the call.


Huntington's Disease Funding

Mr GARLAND question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mrs ARCHER 

[11.13 a.m.]
Tasmania has the second-highest rate of Huntington's disease in the world. The north-west has an even higher concentration than the rest of the state. It is a genetically inherited terminal disease that causes a long, slow, painful decline in its sufferers. I've witnessed an absolute saint of a lady in my community not only having to nurse her husband to his death, but also her two sons. The funding for the state's only Huntington's disease specialist position ends in December 2025 and apparently will not be renewed. How can you allow this vital service to be cut?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question and he is quite right, it is an absolutely dreadful disease that afflicts Tasmanians and other people around the country as well. I have become aware of this issue in recent days and I will come back to you with some further information in relation to that issue. 

The SPEAKER - You are taking that on notice?

Mrs ARCHER - Yes.  Thank you.

CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Bus Service Reliability

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=5.0_D=29.1_C=0.77] Ms BURNET question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT 

[11.15 a.m.]
My question is on behalf of a young woman who I spoke to on the 512 bus to Claremont. Like many public transport users, she told me that the Metro tracking app isn't working and often her buses either aren't on the tracker or don't arrive at all. She would like to know what you will do to make sure the Metro tracking app [Bookmark: Phr3_O=34.9_D=27.7_C=0.77]  will be more reliable.


Potholes - Compensation for Damaged Vehicles

Ms BUTLER question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

The Bass Highway is laden with potholes. Numerous constituents who have sustained damage to their vehicles have reported difficulty in seeking compensation for out-of-cost expenses due to damage incurred from potholes. One constituent has reported $20,000 of damage over four pothole incidents. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=63.1_D=2.8_C=0.50]  Constituents report the process for compensation for vehicle [Bookmark: Phr5_O=66.3_D=30.0_C=0.76]  damage does not include the towing fees or inconvenience caused. Can the minister provide to the House the amount of compensation paid to vehicle owners between Westbury and Devonport by the external contractor for vehicle damage caused by potholes over the last two years? It is not good enough that pothole-dodging under this Liberal-Greens government is now a statewide sport. When are you finally going to fix the Bass Highway? 


Community Funding Grants

Mr JAENSCH question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

My constituency question is [Bookmark: Phr6_O=96.4_D=30.0_C=0.78]  on behalf of community organisations in my electorate of Braddon. When will funding committed in today's Budget be available to grant recipients? 


Chigwell Community Garden Closure

Ms HADDAD question to MINISTER for COMMUNITY and MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS, Ms OGILVIE 

Residents of Chigwell are devastated at the closure of the Chigwell Community Garden, a treasured and important part of our community. The garden provides so many benefits. It's a safe, welcoming place for community connection, has an outdoor playground for young [Bookmark: Phr7_O=126.5_D=29.6_C=0.85]  people and families and provides gardening skills education to everybody. Importantly, it's also a vital resource that grows fresh, healthy food distributed to people in need by Buchaan Community House. It's the only one of its type that also provides disability access with accessible big, raised garden beds. Last night, minister, you said that the House has not historically been funded to run the garden but that you want a solution. What have you done to lobby the Treasurer for funding in today's Budget to keep this vital community asset going?


Injured Birds of Prey Hotline - Funding

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=157.8_D=4.8_C=0.84] Mr GARLAND question to MINISTER for ENVIRONMENT, Ms OGILVIE

Why did the Tasmanian government cut funding for the 1800 hotline for reporting injured or disease birds of prey? That line was crucial for rescue coordination and data collection and it is hard to understand why that prime public service was pulled. Who made the decision to stop the funding and what, if anything, has replaced the reporting-in-response system that used to exist for wildlife emergencies?


Feral Cats

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=194.9_D=29.3_C=0.80] Ms BADGER question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Mr PEARCE

My question is from constituents who are dealing with feral cats. They're a serious issue in the state as a public health risk and to primary industries with the spread of toxoplasmosis and hunting of birds and other native animals as well. In the government's response to the 2024 State of the Environment Report's section on invasive species and feral animals, the government responded that everything was [Bookmark: Phr12_O=224.4_D=28.1_C=0.74]  cool and fine because they were going to have the 2024-2029 Cat Management Plan. It's 2025 and that report does not exist. It has not yet been put out for public consultation. Minister, when is the 2024-2029 Cat Management Plan going to be publicised for public comment? Are you going to have it done before 2029? 


Frankford Highway - Roadworks Completion

Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

My constituent question today is from Duncan about the Frankford Highway [Bookmark: Phr13_O=253.2_D=2.6_C=0.29] , and not only has Duncan raised this with me directly, but many [Bookmark: Phr14_O=256.1_D=17.3_C=0.73]  people contact my office regularly about the upgrades of the Frankford Highway. Has the $44 million that was allocated by the federal government remained secure with the delays to this project and on what specific date will the works commence on the Frankford Highway upgrades?


ANSWER TO QUESTION

Oral Health Tasmania

Mrs ARCHER (Bass - Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing) -  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=283.1_D=21.9_C=0.82] Honourable Speaker, I want to add to or clarify an answer I provided to Ms Rosol earlier. In amongst the many figures that I gave her, one was incorrect, so for clarity, in September 2025 there were 1507 general care occasions of service for adults, an average of 50.2 appointments per day. I misspoke and said 15,000, which is not correct.


STANDING ORDERS - CLARIFICATION

Standing Order 2

[11.20 a.m.]
Mr MITCHELL (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I'm not sure it's right time. Please feel free to let me know.

Clarification on earlier ruling that you made on a point of order they were raised. I made a point of order under Standing Order 2 against the Treasurer for what I said were misleading statements or untrue statements. I just draw your attention to -

Standing Order 2 - Accuracy of Statements.

A Member must only make statements in Parliament and in public that are, to the best of their knowledge, accurate and honest. 

A Member must not mislead Parliament or the public in statements that they make. 

Whether any misleading was intentional or unintentional a Member is obliged to correct the Parliamentary record or the public record, at the earliest opportunity …

The point I was raising was that the Treasurer and other ministers have made the point that the opposition sent the parliament to an election. That's simply factually untrue; it was the Premier. It's a statement of fact.

The SPEAKER - Thank you for your contribution. Your comments are on the record. As has been outlined in this place a few times since the election, Standing Order 2 is not a point of order. Standing Order 2 sets out the Code of Conduct for members of the House of Assembly, as noted in the Companion to the Standing Orders, Second Edition. and I encourage you all to read this book. At page 13: 'The appropriate form of the House to raise an alleged breach of the Code of Conduct is by way of a substantive motion,' as I said this morning,

We want to have a respectful workplace. I remind all members of the obligations contained in the Code of Conduct. You cannot raise the Code of Conduct as a Standing Order, it is by way of a substantive motion.


TABLED PAPER

Joint Sessional Committee on Workplace Culture Oversight - Reports

[11.22 a.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I have the honour to table the following reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Workplace Culture and Oversight; Interim Reports; Code of Conduct for Members; Independent Complaints, Commissioner Process and Alcohol and Other Drugs Members Statements.

Papers tabled.


GREYHOUND RACING LEGISLATION AMENDMENTS (PHASING OUT REFORM) BILL 2025 (No. 66)

First Reading 

Bill presented by Ms Howlett and read the first time.


SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS

Second Reading Forthwith

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, I have two items. First, I move -

That so much of Standing and Sessional of Orders be suspended as would prevent the second reading of the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Amendment Bill 2025 (No. 60) from being moved at this day's sitting. 

Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, can I speak to this just briefly to say we support the suspension and support the debate of this bill irrespective of its maturation. It's a really important bill that brings us into line with national regulations. We welcome it being tabled and are happy to debate it to get it done. 

Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, we have no objections to debating this bill today.

Motion agreed to.


SITTING DATES

 [Bookmark: _Hlk213324331] Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House)(by leave) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House at its rising adjourn until Tuesday 11 November at 12.00 p.m., and that for Tuesday 11 November, Standing Order 19 be suspended. 

Motion agreed to. 


MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORANTCE

Public Housing

[11.26 a.m.]
Mr O'Byrne (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House takes note of the following matter: Public Housing.

I rise on this matter of public importance. It's timely that we have this debate on budget day. Budget day is a moment where the government sets out its priorities and its commitments over the forward Estimates. There is no greater responsibility for a state government than to ensure that all of our citizens living in Tasmania are afforded with the fundamental basic human right of a roof over their head. 

There is a very good reason why state governments across Australia, across the Commonwealth, have been given the responsibility of housing as a key policy matter. We saw deprivations during the Depression and in times of economic hardship where Australians and Tasmanians, like many communities around the world, suffered great hunger and an inability to access health and education services. 

Not only was it a social justice issue; it was an economic issue. If people don't have a safe, secure roof over their head, how are they able to fulfil their full potential as a human in our community? That is why I brought this debate on, because in Tasmania we've seen two things. One, we've seen a policy failure in terms of being able to deliver on that commitment that we, as parliamentarians and as a government, have to the Tasmanian people to look after those in most need. 

Not only have we failed as a matter of policy; in my view the decision to outsource the provision of public housing to an entity at arm's length from the cabinet table has been a betrayal of that commitment that was given to the people of Tasmania generations ago. There are clear roles under the constitution of Australia for state governments to play: in health, education, public transport, and a range of other services, but crucially, an important provision of housing.

We've seen the housing waitlist - and these are not individuals - blow out to 5,336 applicants. Every time in this role, in a role of representative democracy, I have always attempted to walk in the shoes of those who will be impacted by the decisions we either make or refuse to make. In my office, I have so many people everyday coming in with stories of absolute desperation, and need, and want, to have a roof over their head so they can have some form of life in our community. 

We are a country that is blessed with a whole range of resources and economic advantages, and we should be able to distribute that richness fairly across all of our societies and communities.

Some people do characterise public housing tenants in a certain way, in a derogatory way, but that is not true. Every person has the right and the level of dignity to seek a house if they are unable to access it under their own resources. With that expanded waitlist, I am now seeing people who have never sought assistance from government in this regard. These are women fleeing domestic violence, elderly Tasmanians, young families desperate to have the linchpin to provide themselves and their family members a safe and secure environment within which to make a life for themselves in this state.

It is impossible for us as a state and as a government to accept this outcome. I repeat what I said when we had the debate about Homes Tasmania in 2022: that decision took housing further away from the heart of government. 

I acknowledge it is not an easy problem. A complex set of circumstances has created it. However, a fundamental role in the Commonwealth of Australia for a state government is to be able to act to ensure that citizens can access affordable housing, and if they are not able to access affordable housing, that they are provided and supported through public housing. We need to have the planning minister, the infrastructure minister for economic development, the housing minister, the health minister, the communities minister, all of these people at the cabinet table dealing with this and giving it the status it deserves and the work that's required. I urge the House and other members to support this call to ensure that we live up to the promise we gave Tasmanians by providing housing for all. 

[11.31 a.m.]
Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Business, Industry and Resources) - Honourable Speaker, I represent here the Minister for Housing and Planning, who is in the other place. I appreciate the member's interest in this matter. We personally had different discussions and I appreciated his drive and impetus, particularly when it came to the Crawford review into Homes Tasmania. That review and the actions the government will take off the back of it will be important in improving the system, making sure Homes Tasmania is fit for purpose, that it is delivering the core mission, and that there is strong accountability to government and, therefore, the people of Tasmania, particularly those doing it tough.

Nationally, we face significant challenges with increasing demand for public housing. Cost-of-living pressures are putting more people into housing stress and, therefore, increasing demand for social and affordable housing. Tasmania is not immune to these pressures. We know that many Tasmanians are struggling with their household budgets as a result of cost-of-living pressures. Higher interest rates and increased costs of building are also impacting private building development.

We are seeing increased rental prices and short supply of rental properties exacerbating the need. We acknowledge that in each of our four major populations centres, Hobart, Launceston, Devonport and Burnie, rental vacancy rates are below 1 per cent. This is also forcing Tasmanians who were previously in the private rental market to register for social housing.

The Anglicare Housing Connect Front Door quarterly report, released this week, highlighted some of the major challenges we are facing. We are taking a multifaceted approach to addressing these concerns, and I know that the minister for Housing is working closely with the sector to find solutions. We are working hard to increase the supply of both housing stock and affordable rentals across the state to help address this need. 

We are focused on increasing the stock of social housing but also increasing the supply of affordable rentals through our Private Rentals Incentive Program. We are in the process of increasing this number for both the Private Rental Incentive Program and the Family Violence Rapid Rehousing Program, with an additional 200 subsidised rental properties available. This will be done by Homes Tasmania head-leasing these properties and subsidising rent, ensuring more Tasmanians can access safe and secure housing. I understand that Homes Tasmania has received considerable interest from property owners willing to lease their properties under these schemes. These are important programs in helping vulnerable Tasmanians. 

Through the Family Violence Rapid Rehousing scheme over the past four years, more than 50 households a year, on average, have been helped into a home. The number of households assisted is increasing; with a 34 per cent increase in women securing a safe home in 2024-25 compared to the previous year. The average times for these vulnerable applicants to be placed in housing is between two and three months, recognising the need. 

Homes Tasmania has helped fund the building of an additional 311 new social housing properties in the 2024-25 financial year. We have also recently seen the completion of the Queens Walk Housing development in New Town, with 165 units. These units are managed by Housing Choices Australia and has provided quality homes in a great location.

The other issue I will address today is the mismatch between the current housing stock and the needs of the majority of people on the register. Traditionally, social housing consisted of three- to four-bedroom properties aimed at families. The social housing portfolio currently has many underutilised three-bedroom homes. These met the needs of households in previous decades; however, we have seen a shift in demand towards one- and two-bedroom properties. This represents a shift in demographics and demand coming more from singles and couples, or families with just one child. Of the current housing register applications, 3130 are for one-bedroom places and 1293 for two-bedroom residences. That is a very large proportion of the total register. As a result, Homes Tasmania is focusing on delivering more one- and two-bedroom dwellings. 

We are committed to more modular home builds, ensuring quality quick builds. This will enable us to increase the housing stock across the state and deliver more homes faster. The use of modular and prefabricated homes is transforming how we build, reducing weather-related delays, which do happen from time to time in Tasmania, ensuring consistent quality, and supporting local jobs and supply chains across the state. Modular homes are built in factory settings to precise quality controls and the same building codes as site-built homes, ensuring durability, safety and comfort. This approach supports Tasmanian manufacturing, creates local jobs and training opportunities, and delivers quality homes for Tasmanians.

[11.37 a.m.]
Ms BROWN (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I am pleased to rise today on the matter of public importance of social housing. I would see constituents of Franklin coming through the door in my previous role and this problem is not getting better. More and more people are approaching me in my current role, and every single one of those women with children has a Rapid Rehousing application in.

To the former minister's point, only 28 per cent of the target under his commitment at the 2024 election has been reached. That is not good enough. It was also small and shameful of the current minister to stand up after the question I asked in the parliament today and have a crack at me, instead of acknowledging that this was a real problem and taking it seriously. He should have a really hard look at himself over that. These are real people; real women and their children escaping family and sexual violence. They should get the respect from that minister they deserve. I am appalled that he would take that action.

During the 2024 election, I door-knocked heavily in my electorate of Franklin. I spoke to hundreds of people living in Housing Tasmania homes. They told me about the conditions they are living in and they showed me the conditions they are living in. They are doing a good job with the homes they are given, but these homes are riddled with mould. They are being told by housing providers that it is an acceptable amount of mould. That's not good enough. There is no such thing as an acceptable amount of mould, and nobody should be calling up asking for maintenance only to be told that. That is shameful. The minister should take that on board, take that back to those providers and say that that is not good enough.

Regarding the blowout of the housing waitlist, we have seen month after month of these housing waitlists getting longer and longer, and the complex needs of the Tasmanians who are on this list.

For the minister to stand in this place and say, 'I'm listening, I'm giving it a crack,' that is not good enough. He needs to have a plan. He needs to have action. To say to Tasmanians that 'I'm listening' is not enough, because whilst he's listening, they are living rough, they are living in dangerous situations, and they need more from this government. You've had 11 years, those on that side - 11 years - and this list is growing longer and this problem is getting worse. Take a good hard look at yourselves.

This is the cost of the inaction from that side. This is the cost that I see every day in my electorate of Franklin. The people I see when they come in to my office or out in the community say that they have reached the end, and their housing provider said they've done all they can. That's not good enough. Nobody should be in a situation where that's just it and you're stuck. That is what people are being told in my electorate, and that's what people are being told all over Tasmania. That is not good enough.

For the government to say that they are on track to reach their 10,000 social homes target is an absolute farce, and for you to stand up and say those words and then be able to look at yourselves in the mirror is despicable. You're counting in vacant lots, you're counting in already rentals. This is just disgraceful.

Time expired.

[11.42 a.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I, too, rise to talk about the lack of social housing in Tasmania. Across Tasmania, more than 4500 Tasmanians are on the social housing waiting list. Behind that number are people, parents, children and older Tasmanians living in cars, tents, couch surfing, or paying rents they simply can't afford.

In the north-west, the problem is particularly acute. In towns like Devonport, Burnie and Ulverstone, we're seeing record levels of housing stress. Vacancy rates are effectively zero. Rents have risen faster than wages, and too many Tasmanians who work full-time still can't find a secure, affordable place to live. According to Anglicare, the number of affordable rentals in the north-west has dropped by 27 per cent. For people on the lowest incomes, there are no affordable private rentals, and the gap between what they can afford and what's on the market keeps widening.

This shortage isn't just a housing issue; it's a barrier to addressing domestic and family violence, bed block in our hospitals, and persistent disadvantage across our communities. Under these conditions, it's hard for anyone to find a rental at any price. For those on low incomes, even the cheapest rentals are out of reach, and they're often outbid by people earning more.

On the north-west coast, this situation is set to worsen when hundreds of fly-in fly-out workers arrive for the Northwest Transmission Developments and Marinus Link projects - something the government's own department has warned about, yet has done nothing to prepare for.

The government's mismanagement of public housing is appalling. Their priorities are completely misplaced. In the 2024-25 State Budget, the government committed to expanding the private rental incentive scheme to 400 properties and the family violence rapid rehousing program to 150 properties. According to Anglicare, these targets are nowhere near being met. In fact, the number of properties in both schemes has gone backwards.

In July 2024, less than half the target was achieved - just 224 out of 400 private rental incentive scheme properties, and 48 out of 150 rapid rehousing properties. By August 2025, the numbers had fallen further: 211 homes under the private rental incentive scheme, which is 53 per cent of the 400 commitment, and 42 homes providing family violence rapid rehousing, which is 28 per cent of the 150 commitment.

These failures have real human consequences. The lack of social housing is fuelling inequality. It's trapping people in poverty and preventing women from leaving violent relationships. When a single mother is paying 70 per cent of their income in rent, she can't afford to save, she can't afford training, and she can't afford to move forward.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=11.1_D=26.8_C=0.84] We can't keep pretending this is a temporary market blip. This is a structural failure that has been building for years. The state has not invested enough in social housing, and the private market simply cannot fill the gap, especially in our regional areas. The government's tinkering around the edges is not fixing the problem. What we need is a major, sustained investment in social and affordable housing, not one-off announcements that take years to deliver.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=39.0_D=2.4_C=0.62] The government needs to get it [Bookmark: Phr5_O=41.8_D=9.6_C=0.81] s priorities, right? Imagine if the Premier invested the same political capital and the same financial capital into social housing as he has into the stadium. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=52.3_D=27.0_C=0.81]  At around $350,000 per dwelling, the $1.8 billion being spent on the stadium could build 6,666 one-and two-bedroom homes. That would be enough to clear the entire public housing waiting list. Make no mistake, prioritising a shiny new stadium over investing in social housing is a choice, and it's a choice that says everything about this government's values. 

[11.47 a.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - [Bookmark: Phr7_O=80.4_D=2.8_C=0.63]  Honourable Speaker, I too rise to talk about public housing [Bookmark: Phr8_O=83.7_D=29.9_C=0.83]  and thank the member for bringing this on. It is a critically important topic, and we take the opportunity to talk about this at every opportunity we get. I acknowledge upfront that, as has been said already, that this is one of the key issues that comes through at my office in terms of constituents needing help. Housing is a fundamental human right. It is a right and it is a responsibility of government to provide a roof over the home of every single Tasmanian who needs it, and we are [Bookmark: Phr9_O=113.7_D=17.8_C=0.83]  consistently failing here. 

I'm happy to acknowledge upfront that this is a complex issue and this is a multi-jurisdictional issue. There are issues for local government in this space, in terms of planning and other resourcing and planning. There are issues for the federal government and there are big issues when it comes to capital gains tax [Bookmark: Phr10_O=132.0_D=29.7_C=0.87] , negative gearing and the like. I acknowledge my federal MPs who have done fabulous work in this space. There is no doubt that there is more that the Tasmanian government can do as well. 

We're talking this is about public housing, but every public housing tenant would like to be in their own private dwelling. It must be said that issues in terms of reining in short-stay accommodation, in terms of renters' rights have to be [Bookmark: Phr11_O=161.8_D=29.6_C=0.81]  part of this debate. It was welcome to hear the minister yesterday acknowledging that he has short-stay accommodation and dealing with short stay accommodation in his sights. That is welcome, and we urge him to take action quickly on that because it is stripping whole homes out of the rental market. 

We do note that the 5 per cent levy that this government promised two elections ago has not been delivered. It's been kicked into the long grass; that was going to be invested into other housing initiatives, and [Bookmark: Phr12_O=191.6_D=29.9_C=0.80]  it is simply hasn't materialised. That's not good enough. We are watching the minister and his response to short-stay. When it comes to renters' rights, it's welcome we've given renters the right to have pets in their properties, but it doesn't end there. We need to end unfair no-cause evictions. We need to control out-of-control rents. We need to make sure properties have minimum standards so that helps deal with electricity costs and other issues to do with comfort and quality of life. 

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=221.7_D=30.0_C=0.82] We need to make sure that tenants can undertake minor modifications, whether it be for disability access, whether it be for communication, safety or security, it is really important. Report after report has demonstrated that rental stress is increasing in the community. In June, TasCOSS highlighted that rental affordability is at an all-time low and that rental costs had increased by 43 per cent since 2020. This is what's driving people [Bookmark: Phr14_O=251.8_D=26.8_C=0.84]  to public housing; this is why the public housing wait list is growing ever greater. It's because people simply can't afford to secure their own private rental and vacancy rates, as has been said, are at all all-time low. For the second year in a row there were zero properties affordable in the state for people on some of the lowest incomes. 

In September, the Tenants' Union published their report on Tasmanian rents. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=279.5_D=2.5_C=0.35]  Over the last year on the northwest coast. Rents have gone up by 7 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=282.2_D=22.8_C=0.80] .8 per cent, greater Launceston by 6 per cent, greater Hobart by 4.6 per cent. This is adding to the cost-of-living pressures on people in addition to food, power, fuel and all the impacts of having a family if they have one. This is driving people to public housing, and public housing is a really important backstop for people that is our responsibility to deliver. In an ideal world, it's temporary until they get back into the private market, but for some people who are in challenging situations it's a permanent prospect and it is on us to give them something permanent.

The Homes Tasmania dashboard, as has been said, is now at record levels with 5330 applicants. That's not 5330 Tasmanians, it's 5330 applicants. Many of them have partners and children or grandchildren, and they're waiting ever longer. 

Anglicare released their report that shows that many people are sleeping rough. There's been an 88 per cent increase in people sleeping rough, 54 per cent of people living in unsuitable dwellings and, shockingly, a 60 per cent increase in children as part of that mix seeking accommodation.

It was great to hear the minister acknowledge that Homes Tasmania is simply not doing enough. The Greens didn't support its institution as a public non-financial corporation in 2022. Clearly something needs to be done. Choices on budget day about how we deal with these issues are political choices, and I raise again the issue of the stadium, investing money in the stadium, and the focus of government as opposed to the needs of Tasmanians.

[11.51 a.m.]
Mr Di FALCO (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Franklin for raising this important issue. Public housing in Tasmania is not just a policy issue, it's a human one. Behind every statistic are Tasmanians who are doing it tough.

I want to focus today on two groups who are particularly vulnerable - women with young children who are without housing, and older Tasmanians have been priced out of the market or forced to move away from their communities.

Across the state, we are hearing more stories about single mothers living in cars, couch surfing or waiting months for emergency accommodation. These are women doing everything right - working casual shifts, caring for children, and trying to stay close to schools and support networks, but the housing supply simply isn't keeping pace with the demand. For a mother trying to build a stable future, a roof over their children's heads is not a luxury; it is a foundation for everything else - education, employment and health. 

The government's commitment to building and maintaining more social housing is welcome, but it must be delivered faster and smarter. Too often the process is bogged down in planning delays and limited by a shortage of builders. We need stronger partnerships with community housing providers, better existing vacant stock and innovative housing models that allow women and children to stay safe and connected to their communities while they get back on their feet.

Then there are the older Tasmanians. Many of them have rented their whole lives, and now as the market tightens they find themselves competing against younger families and higher incomes for the same few properties. Some are being pushed out of the towns they've lived in for decades; away from doctors, friends and local services.

Public housing should be there to give these Tasmanians dignity in retirement, a secure home where they can access aid safely and affordably. Regional Tasmanians often wear the worst of the economic pressures our state faces. I hope the Budget today gives much-needed support to Tasmanians doing it tough. Thank you.

[11.54 a.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I will speak briefly because I know there are others who want to contribute. It is fundamentally the role of government to provide public housing to people who are most in need. They can do that through partnerships with the social housing sector, and governments of both persuasions have done that, but the social and moral obligation to provide public housing to people most in need sits with government. No matter how you set up the governance, that social and moral obligation sits with government, and this government is failing. They've been failing for 11 years since they came to office. They haven't done anything; they've just deprioritised it. I saw it firsthand in the public sector. It's just not been a priority for this government for their whole term of 11 years.

Who's paying the price for that deprioritisation? It's Tasmanians. It's people in need. It's people sleeping in cars, sleeping rough, returning to violent relationships. We've seen the waitlist grow year on year on year. It never dips, it just gets bigger and bigger and as others have said, each of those 5336 applications represent more people - children, partners, grandparents.

Shelters are full, transitional housing is full, there's a lack of available housing in the public housing sector, the social housing sector and the private sector. There are bottlenecks everywhere and the result is that people are doing it tough and it's getting worse and worse every year. It's a massive public policy failure of this government that they've let it get this bad. We're a small state. We should be able to provide housing for 5336 families. Other states have housing lists way worse than that. We're a small state that should be able to solve this problem and this government has been failing to do it.

Labor did put forward different options at the last two elections, including short-stay regulation, a massive problem; a public sector maintenance and construction workforce to increase public housing, not just social housing; a build-to-rent scheme with affordable rentals locked into the market for 30 years; investment in co-op housing, an innovative form of housing, particularly for women and children; and other policies that we put forward for an increase in social and government housing. Those policies were rejected at the election and by the crossbench at this year's election and that's shameful, because we could be fixing this problem and we should be fixing this problem as a state.

Like everyone who has spoken before me, people with housing concerns make up the bulk of the constituent load for all of us as MPs, and I just wanted to share two recent stories from the last 10 days. A woman we've been advocating for for some time came to visit me to say she's finally housed. Now that she's housed she's back at work, her adult daughter is now back at TAFE, and she's potentially going to have her other children able to come and live with her again.

Not many people follow up every time when you've had a successful example of advocacy, but it was really satisfying to have her come into my office and tell me that. I said to her, 'I'm so happy to hear that, but this is not how the system should work. You shouldn't need me writing a letter to the minister. You shouldn't need to talk to the media.' She didn't, but others have. That's a broken system. You shouldn't need that kind of advocacy. You should just get what you need.

One of her friends is sleeping rough underneath a bridge with his 15 year-old son who has missed school all of this year. Part of the reason she came to see me was to ask me to write a letter on behalf of that friend of hers, which I've now done. It's totally unacceptable that people are not only missing out on a safe roof over their heads, but their kids are missing out on education, safe, warm, affordable places to live, healthy food to be able to prepare and eat with your family, and they're missing out on employment. You can't get any of the other things in your life sorted if you don't have a safe roof over your head. You can't address your education needs, your employment needs, mental health, issues of addiction, all of those things that affect our lives, every one of us. You can't deal with those if you don't have a safe roof over your head.

The Labor Party did oppose the legislation to establish Homes Tasmania as a statutory authority. I've got great respect for many of the people working in that statutory authority, but it isn't the right governance model for Tasmania. It puts the responsibility - the fundamental public, social and moral responsibility of government - at arm's length from government. It's been tried, it's failed and it's time to bring it back into the public sector.

[11.59 a.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I also thank Mr O'Byrne for bringing this important matter to parliament for discussion. We have heard that shelter and housing is a human right, but this right is being bestowed on fewer and fewer Tasmanians. We have a growing public housing waiting list and we have more people who are vulnerable and finding themselves in intolerable, unsafe situations, and many of those things have been aired already. People are joining the ranks and living in less secure housing and it's just a blight on this state and this state's reputation.

One such constituent is Jamie, who would be well-known to many members of Clark. I know that he's written to various housing ministers. He's written to minister Ellis previously but has also written to and heard back from minister Vincent. Jamie is on the priority housing wait list. He's been waiting for 53 months while the average there is 80 weeks. A lot of people with high priorities are not being seen to. He's not alone. It's a growing situation and this is totally and utterly unacceptable.

This morning, minister Vincent fielded many questions about housing and felt that he hadn't been hearing solutions - I know this was Question Time, so he wasn't necessarily going to hear solutions - but he has heard solutions, and we've had many discussions. One of the solutions -

REGISTRATION TO WORK WITH VULNERABLE PEOPLE AMENDMENT BILL 2025 (No. 60)

Second Reading

[12.01 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice, Corrections and Rehabilitation) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the bill be now read a second time.

The bill amends the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Act 2013, known as the RWVP Act. This reflects one of the agreement items from the 15 August meeting of the Standing Council of Attorneys-General, known as SCAG, which was:

To urgently work towards implementation by the end of 2025 of mutual recognition of negative notices known as declined applications or refusals of Working with Children Checks so that a person denied a check or whose check has been revoked in one jurisdiction cannot be granted or hold a Working with Children Check in another jurisdiction. [tbc]

Tasmania's RWVP Act currently provides for a robust working with children and vulnerable people registration process ahead of its time. The act already provides that a person denied registration or who has had their registration cancelled in another jurisdiction cannot apply for registration in Tasmania for a period of five years unless there has been a significant exceptional change in circumstances.

Currently, when a person who's already registered in Tasmania, an interstate decision to deny or cancel their equivalent registration would result in a risk assessment under our act.

The Government has already implemented amendments recommended by the Commission of Inquiry to ensure suspensions are used during risk assessments process when appropriate. However, the SCAG agreement, with our full support, is to take this a step further so the registrar must cancel a Tasmanian registration following interstate cancellation or suspension.

A consultation draft of the bill was prepared to ensure Tasmania's fulfilment of the SCAG agreement. The draft was released for both public and targeted consultation, with a total of 18 submissions received. We appreciated the support given for those important objectives and the stakeholders who raised issues for further consideration.

In particular, I appreciate the Interim Commissioner for Children and Young People's submission. I'm pleased to say all the commissioner's recommendations for the bill have been addressed and other matters raised are part of our ongoing work as part of the SCAG agreement to harmonise processes with other jurisdictions.

I will now go through the amendments made by the bill.

First, the bill provides under section 51, that the registrar must cancel a person's registration in a category of registration if the registrar is satisfied that while the person holds registration in that category under the act, the person has been refused registration in an equivalent category of registration under a corresponding law, or the person's registration in an equivalent category of registration under a corresponding law has been cancelled. This amendment assures that when a person is already registered in Tasmania, an interstate decision to deny or cancel their registration would result in immediate cancellation rather than a risk assessment as is currently the case.

In addition, to mutual recognition of refusals and cancellations, the bill goes further than the SCAG agreement to also enable the mutual recognition of suspensions under amendment 2, section 49, and what are known as 'interim bars' on people working with their application is being considered under Section 18. This is in response to the submission made by the Commissioner for Children and Young People on the consultation draft, who noted the work of some other jurisdictions in this area. Suspensions are dealt with as part of the risk-assessment process, which occurs when new relevant information about a person is obtained.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=16.2_D=29.6_C=0.82] Section 49 of the act deals with the grounds for suspension or cancellation of registration. The bill amends this section to introduce a new paragraph providing that, for the avoidance of doubt, the registrar must suspend a person's registration when conducting an additional risk assessment of the person on the grounds that the person's registration under the corresponding law has been suspended under that corresponding law. The registrar can then see if the interstate decision progresses to a cancellation [Bookmark: Phr3_O=46.4_D=27.0_C=0.88] , in which case the bill ensures that the Tasmanian registration is also cancelled. 

The bill also introduces an amendment to section 20 to require applicants to proactively disclose any history of negative registration decisions in other jurisdictions. If an applicant does not disclose this history, it will still be uncovered through the current checking process. However, having a positive requirement for disclosure is a useful step. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=73.9_D=25.4_C=0.82]  Any dishonest withholding of information in an application is relevant to the risk assessment process. 

In response to a submission from the Commissioner for Children and Young People, a further amendment has been introduced in the bill to provide that people holding registration are required to disclose any history of negative notices in other jurisdictions. The bill includes a new section 47A, making it an offence for a registered person to [Bookmark: Phr5_O=100.2_D=4.0_C=0.86]  fail to disclose these matters similarly to the current requirement to disclose [Bookmark: Phr6_O=104.5_D=25.5_C=0.74]  offences. 

Finally, the bill amends section 19 of the act. The current effect of section 19 of the act is that a person whose registration has been refused or who has had their registration cancelled under a corresponding law may only apply for registration if the application is made after a period of five years has elapsed or the registrar is satisfied that there has been significant and exceptional change in the person's circumstances. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=130.6_D=4.7_C=0.82]  Different jurisdictions have different requirements, such as different exclusion periods for reapplication [Bookmark: Phr8_O=135.7_D=5.5_C=0.67]  following a refusal of an application for or cancellation of a person's registration.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=141.6_D=29.8_C=0.84] The bill amends section 19 to restrict a person whose registration has been refused or who has had their registration cancelled under a corresponding law from applying for registration in equivalent categories in Tasmania for as long as they are ineligible to apply for registration under the corresponding law. The consultation draft provided that this would be in addition to the current circumstances under which they are allowed to apply, namely after five years or if there are significant [Bookmark: Phr10_O=171.5_D=4.4_C=0.77]  and exceptional circumstances. This is no longer the case in the tabled bill. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=176.6_D=7.8_C=0.76]  

Following consideration of the submission of the Commission for Children and Young People, this provides for even greater consistency in the mutual recognition model. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=184.7_D=27.2_C=0.86]  It is also important to note that any applicant for registration in Tasmania is subject to a thorough risk assessment to determine whether they continue to present a risk to vulnerable people. A new subsection 19 subsection 5 ensures that only the refusal or cancellation made in the original jurisdiction is considered by the Registrar and not the resultant refusals or cancellations made by other jurisdictions mutually recognising the decision of the originating [Bookmark: Phr13_O=212.7_D=3.4_C=0.82]  jurisdiction. This is so that the eligibility to reapply [Bookmark: Phr14_O=216.5_D=30.0_C=0.75]  is tied to the original jurisdiction that cancelled the registration or refused an application. 

It also important to acknowledge the way in which the procedural fairness is dealt with in the National Mutual Recognition Scheme. Appeal rights in relation to a decision under a corresponding law will continue to be exercised under that corresponding law. Further, these are important new powers of the registrar and must be exercised carefully as any powers are. For example, the Registrar must be satisfied that a person's registration has been cancelled [Bookmark: Phr15_O=246.6_D=27.4_C=0.81]  interstate before cancelling that person's registration here. 

It is an important principle of administrative law that if a decision-maker makes an error in relation to the exercise of their powers, such as a case of mistaken identity, then the decision made has no legal effect and will be set aside by the decision-maker. These amendments are part of a broader framework of reforms currently being led by the SCAG in relation to working with children checks. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=274.9_D=1.9_C=0.69]  

Tasmania will continue to contribute to the development [Bookmark: Phr17_O=277.0_D=22.0_C=0.79]  of these very important reforms which aim to strengthen protection for children and achieve greater consistency between Working with Children Check schemes across jurisdictions. Such reforms recognise the crucial role these safeguards play in ensuring the safety and protection of children and vulnerable people in our community. 

It's my hope this bill will proceed urgently [Bookmark: Phr18_O=299.6_D=5.4_C=0.82]  through both this place and the other place to ensure Tasmania gives effect to this national agreement. 

I commend the bill to the House.

[12.10 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Amendment Bill 2025. As indicated earlier, we will be supporting the bill, as well as having supported the suspension of Standing Orders to debate it today. I thank the Attorney-General for the briefing provided by his department earlier this week and for the important information shared with me at that briefing.

As we have heard from the Attorney-General, the bill amends our current act, the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Act 2013, responding to an agreement made at the Standing Council of Attorneys-General (SCAG) in August this year. That explains some of the haste this bill needs to be dealt with to be passed by the end of this year. The SCAG agreed that states and territories would work towards implementation by the end of this year of mutual recognition of negative notices so that people denied cards or who have had cards revoked in one jurisdiction can't be granted or hold cards in other jurisdictions. That is what this bill seeks to achieve.

The Standing Council of Attorneys-General's decision also reflects recommendations and evidence heard by the commission of inquiry into gaps in the current systems in Tasmania, but also across state and territory borders, meaning that people who should not have been deemed eligible for Registration to Work with Vulnerable People were, in fact, holders of registration. As the commission of inquiry has shown us, that led to devastating outcomes for young people, so there is an imperative, in any case, for us to improve our existing systems. I know there is shared view across the Chamber that we need to ensure the systems of registration we have in place genuinely keep young people safe and that when things go wrong, that can be dealt.  We need to ensure that when people have been incorrectly issued cards, that people can raise those issues, that there's a reporting requirement on people to raise issues that need to come to the attention of the Registrar to revoke cards or refuse to issue cards in the first place.

It is important that there is national harmonisation across these systems, and that's what the standing council meeting considered. A lack of national consistency leads to very obvious but hard-to-deal-with outcomes of people being able to subvert the system and move to a different state or territory in order to potentially exploit young people and vulnerable people. It is probably a little less prevalent here because we are an island state. However, in mainland states with border towns, people quite often live in one and work in another. I have family that grew up in Wodonga but went to school in Albury, and I know lots of people live across state and territory borders in other parts of Australia, so there it is an even more prevalent risk and all the more reason why that national decision was made. It is important to make sure that there is harmonisation across state and territory boundaries.

I will share a little bit of the information that community organisations and individuals shared with the government in their community consultation process. I recognise, as the Attorney-General explained in his second reading, that the Interim Commissioner of Children and Young People, Isabelle Crompton, provided significant feedback, and that has been largely adopted in this bill. I don't propose to go through the details of the community consultations where the government has responded to those and addressed those concerns. However, I want to recognise the important work Ms Crompton has done in that interim commissioner role and in providing very robust advice to government on this bill and others. 

Also, the government heard from Carers Tasmania, the Tasmanian Bar Association, the Country Women's Association, the Council on the Ageing Tasmania, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Tasmanian chapter, Volunteering Tasmania and the Centre for Excellence in Child and Family Welfare and the Association of Massage Therapists. Many of those organisations simply stated that they were in support of the changes proposed in this bill while others made more substantive contributions suggesting changes, some of which have been adopted since the consultation draft.

I will share some of the comments made in the submission by Laurel House. I thank their chief executive officer, Kathryn Fordyce, and their board, who do incredible work advocating for victim/survivors of sexual violence. Talking about the consultation draft, they first raised how the 'significant and exceptional circumstances' part of it allows the Registrar to approve registration despite a prior cancellation or refusal in another jurisdiction if there has been a significant and exceptional change in their personal circumstances. They said: 

While we acknowledge the need for procedural fairness, and that there will be circumstances where discretion on this basis could be exercised, this wording is subjective and open to arbitrary and lenient interpretation. In our experience, and borne out by the evidence, the ongoing risks associated with sexual violence and what constitutes sexual violence are commonly misunderstood. This includes misconceptions about sexual harassment, consent and grooming. For example, fewer than half of adults can recognise common grooming behaviours such as giving gifts to a child.

If sexual violence is not adequately understood, there is a serious risk that it will be misidentified, minimalised or missed completely, and a Registration to Work with Vulnerable People registration may, as a result, be granted in situations where there are high risks to children and vulnerable people. 

We can think of very few circumstances where change would be significant and exceptional enough to grant someone with a history of sexual violence offending a registration in this context, especially given the rates of recidivism for such offences are generally high. Registrars should be supported to make informed decisions in relation to sexual violence and to err on the side of caution, given the heightened risk to children and vulnerable people should a registration be inappropriately approved.

They went on to suggest that the bill should include information about what does and does not constitute significant and exceptional change in circumstances, with examples and guidance for the Registrar to indicate what might be appropriate to consider in that exception. Could the Attorney-General advise the Chamber whether the government plans to provide that kind of guidance, if not through legislative change, then perhaps through guidelines issued by the government?

They also talked about the importance of trauma-informed practices and processes. They said: 

Assessing whether there has been a change of circumstances - 

This is in relation to the part I have just shared:

- involves a complex risk assessment. These assessments will have direct impacts on the safety and wellbeing of vulnerable people, including those who have experienced trauma because of sexual violence. This extends to victim/survivors of other gender-based violence, including family violence. In making any assessment, it is vital that the Registrar considers certain things.

They point to some of those things, including the prevalence and impact of trauma, the importance of preventing re-traumatisation of victim/survivors, and trauma-informed principles, including providing safety, transparency, support and collaboration when working with victim/survivors of sexual violence.

Finally, they go on to highlight the need for training and education, referencing the commission of inquiry's recent findings. They said the commission of inquiry found that a range of bodies, including the Registrar of the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People scheme in Tasmania, historically failed to share information received about potential child abusers with other institutions. They said the primary barrier to cross-government coordination and information-sharing in relation to child sexual abuse was a deeply held cultural belief that perpetrator privacy was more important than child safety and child rights. 

They quote the commission of inquiry's finding that said: 

We can understand how sometimes it can feel easier to stay silent, but the abuse of children thrives when people don't speak up.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=5.5_D=27.2_C=0.83] I know that cultural change is much more complex than words in legislation, but the points that Laurel House have raised in their submission are very important for the parliament and government to consider, given that part of what will lead to the cultural change that the commission of inquiry pointed to in terms of a culture of secrecy and cover-up that was embedded in so many institutions [Bookmark: Phr3_O=34.4_D=10.3_C=0.92] , are changes like those contained in this bill which are part of the mix. They're part of what needs to happen to eventually lead to some of that cultural change.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=46.0_D=17.4_C=0.87] Finally, I just wanted to share a little bit of the submission that was provided by Deborah Thompson. Deborah is known to many in the Chamber. She's a dedicated domestic violence advocate for change. She has incredible lived experience that she [Bookmark: Phr5_O=65.0_D=8.6_C=0.87]  uses for good while also taking a massive emotional toll on her to have to relive the violence that she experienced [Bookmark: Phr6_O=75.3_D=23.3_C=0.85]  through her writing, and she's the author of several books. I went to one of her book launches with the member for Lyons who's just about to leave the Chamber, Minister Howlett, and I and also Meg Webb, the member for Nelson, who attended one of her book launches a couple of years ago where she spoke so compellingly about the importance of lived experience being a part of designing any systems change.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=99.4_D=4.3_C=0.79] She also wrote to the government and I wanted to acknowledge that she went to that effort [Bookmark: Phr8_O=104.1_D=29.4_C=0.81]  and provided very important feedback on the draft bill, including suggestions around requiring applicants to proactively disclose their history. That's part of what this bill does. It puts a positive obligation on applicants to disclose if they've had a cancellation or a negative notice or a revocation in another jurisdiction. I know that's not going to be the only thing the registrar will rely on in making a decision around an application. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=134.5_D=8.6_C=0.92]  There will be other elements of the assessment of that application, but she does point to some of the risks [Bookmark: Phr10_O=144.8_D=23.9_C=0.82]  around data and she says:

Unless data is available nationally and easily accessible to organisations, crucial information of past abuse may not be available. Since there is little incentive for an applicant to proactively disclose their history, an organisation could be unaware of history of a history of abuse, especially if an offender has not been charged with past crimes of abuse. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=169.8_D=5.2_C=0.78]  [TBC]

I think that's a very important point that Ms Thompson makes. 

I appreciate that proactive [Bookmark: Phr12_O=175.3_D=9.7_C=0.84]  obligation that's been created by this bill and also recognise that there are offences created by this bill for people who don't proactively disclose that information [Bookmark: Phr13_O=186.6_D=11.3_C=0.87] , but part of what will make this scheme successful is making sure that those systems across states and territories are robust and that data is freely and [Bookmark: Phr14_O=200.1_D=16.4_C=0.81]  swiftly shared across state and territory registrars to make sure that the kinds of horrors we heard shared through the commission of inquiry never have the chance to happen again to any children or vulnerable people [Bookmark: Phr15_O=217.6_D=1.6_C=0.92]  in Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=220.3_D=17.3_C=0.86] With those brief comments, I'll take my seat and look forward to the Attorney-General being able to provide a little bit of detail on some of those issues I raised around the significant and exceptional circumstances part of the bill, as well as training and education [Bookmark: Phr17_O=240.3_D=0.5_C=0.75]  around [Bookmark: Phr18_O=241.0_D=9.8_C=0.84]  cultural change and around disclosure and also about that data-sharing across states and territories that will be the marker of success or failure of this scheme.

[12.24 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) -  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=251.3_D=4.8_C=0.68]  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=258.1_D=3.0_C=0.83]  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=263.3_D=10.4_C=0.86] Deputy Speaker, I rise to share our views on this very important bill. The Greens welcome this, which was [Bookmark: Phr22_O=275.5_D=11.8_C=0.84]  broadly strongly supported by stakeholders and there are some questions from the consultation process which I will raise. [Bookmark: Phr23_O=289.4_D=3.2_C=0.64]  It was a bill that was supported in full [Bookmark: Phr24_O=293.1_D=11.9_C=0.74]  and without qualification by Carers Tasmania, the Tasmanian Bar, the Association of Massage Therapists, the Country Women's Association in Tasmania, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Centre for Excellence in Child and Family Welfare. 

It's worth noting, however, that there were a number of stakeholders who raised concerns about the consultation process itself and the brief 14-day consultation process. Volunteering Tasmania is obviously a very key stakeholder in this space and they commented that they didn't have enough time to meaningfully engage with all of their members across a very diverse sector. Given the importance of their views on these matters, that is concerning. Consultation processes, particularly on matters such as this, need to be genuine, and I acknowledge that there are deadline pressures in various situations for the government and there are competing priorities that can lead to less than optimal consultation timeframes and tabling, but I also note that this is a concerning trend under this government. 

In my time in parliament what I have seen over this year is that we've had a couple of bills now that consultation has been sought on after they've been tabled. That is not a good consultation process and it signals to people who would make a contribution that they're not really going to be listened to. It sounds as though the door is closed and it's just ticking a box. It doesn't signal an openness to making meaningful changes.

I am not making a point about the intentions or the motivations of the government in this instance, but I strongly encourage the government to manage the various stages of legislation better in the future to make sure that each stage has time for proper consultation and to bear in mind, particularly for legislation that requires the input of community groups, how difficult it is for community groups to meet, organise and distribute really important legislative changes to get their head around them in consultation timeframes. Two weeks is manifestly insufficient.

I want to talk about the inclusion of amendments to sections 18 and 49 of the principal act and the proposed new section 47A. These inclusions come from the feedback of the Commissioner for Children and Young People, and the amendments to section 19 have also been altered to reflect feedback from the Commissioner for Children and Young People.

Those amendments in turn, as we read them, mean that some of the recommendations that have been made by Laurel House have been indirectly addressed. I want to thank the work of Kathryn Fordyce, the CEO of Laurel House, for her continuing advocacy for victim/survivors to ensure that those abuses will never occur again. One of the recommendations they made that has not been affected by these amendments was the recommendation that the government amend the bill to:

Allow someone to apply for registration, where their registration under a corresponding law has been cancelled, if the person can establish the cancellation was due to malicious intent of a third party. [TBC]

Minister, can you outline why this recommendation was not adopted?

The Council on the Ageing Tasmania recommended there should be clarification in respect of what constitutes an 'equivalent category' in section 51 of the principal act. Can you please give us an understanding of why this has not been defined and how this provision would be interpreted? This is in the instance where a person is already registered in Tasmania and there is an interstate decision to deny or cancel that person's registration. What this section 51 amendment would require is that the registrar in Tasmania must cancel that person's registration in the equivalent category. Maybe it seems like 'equivalent category' is obvious, but I guess between states there would be differences in legislation and therefore potentially grey areas about what a category is, so could you speak to that, please?

Recommendations were also made regarding educating community and volunteer organisations by a number of different people who made submissions about the new requirements that this act would usher in. Can you please talk to how the government intends to communicate these matters, particularly with a view to community organisations who are the least resourced and have very large numbers of people that they're needing to communicate these changes with? What are your plans and what's the timeline for communicating that?

In saying that, the Greens are really pleased to support this move to make sure that perpetrators can't move between jurisdictions. There is notorious and abundant information that perpetrators have done this and we want to do everything we can as a state to protect vulnerable young people and this is a really good piece of legislation to make those changes. Thank you.

[12.32 p.m.]
Mr RAZAY (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, protecting the most vulnerable in our community is of the utmost importance and for many years state and territories have relied solely on their own registration laws for conducting Working with Vulnerable People checks. Whilst each jurisdiction has had its own system of registration checks, it became apparent in each jurisdiction that a national approach in relation to registration, suspensions, cancellations or refusals was needed.

A system that would harmonise Working with Vulnerable People registration processes across all jurisdiction was required to strengthen Working with Vulnerable People protections. It's reassuring that all states and territories are taking vulnerable people's safety seriously and have come together as part of a national reform agenda agreed by the Standing Council of Attorneys-General in August 2025 to make important and swift changes to corresponding state and territory legislation in a united effort to better protect vulnerable people from exploitation and abuse.

I commend and fully support the government's decisive and prompt action towards strengthening the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Act 2013 by the end of 2025. It is delivering on its commitment to a very important national agreement. It is crucial that a person who has been denied registration or whose registration has been revoked in one jurisdiction cannot be granted or hold Working with Vulnerable People registration in another jurisdiction. This bill seeks to close any existing gaps in the registration system so a person who has had registration refused, suspended or revoked in one state or territory will not be granted or hold Working with Vulnerable People registration in another jurisdiction.

These stronger protections are crucial to the future safeguarding of vulnerable people. I therefore support the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Amendment Bill 2025 and the proposed amendment to the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Act 2013.

[12.35 p.m.]
Mr GEORGE (Franklin) - Deputy Speaker, I did promise the Attorney-General that I wouldn't speak, so I apologise. I'm not going to delay this long. Noting the reservations of the Greens leader and of the shadow attorney-general, I commend those three people for their collaboration on this bill and I look forward to more work in what is clearly a crucial area. As someone who, as a new MP, will be applying for my ability to work with vulnerable people in the near future, I do hope that the Attorney-General makes sure that the resources are in place to make this an effective piece of legislation.

The reason I wanted to speak is that I realise this is not a controversial bill, but I want to put on the record that the Attorney-General has made considerable efforts to brief me on this and other legislation he is putting forward, and I suspect the same with other crossbenchers as well. He was the first to approach me when I entered parliament and offered to keep me up to date with his plans and legislation from his department. I believe he was the first of the ministerial positions to make an effort to really put into place collaboration as a minority government with the crossbench, and I commend him for that. 

[12.36 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Attorney-General) - Deputy Speaker, I'm sort of blushing at the moment, a little red-cheeked. I want to acknowledge the last speaker, the Independent member for Franklin - thank you very much for sharing those remarks. It's something that I try to do, to reach out and collaborate with the crossbench and indeed others across the parliament. We can't always agree on things, but we can agree to disagree respectfully and try to progress through our objectives for the good of Tasmania, so I appreciate the remarks that have been shared.

I would like to indicate and thank all who responded in their second reading contributions, and I thank this parliament for suspending Standing Orders to consider the bill today in light of its urgency, recognising its priority in providing strong safeguards for working with children in Tasmania and those children checks. It's also consistent, of course, with that national agreement which I shared in my opening remarks in my second reading speech and the SCAG meeting held just a couple of months ago.

I particularly thank the Commissioner for Children and Young People for the feedback she has provided. I again commend and thank her. Further improvements in the bill have resulted from that feedback.

I also thank all who have made submissions to the bill. They have been identified by the shadow attorney and Dr Woodruff as well. Likewise, Professor George Razay has indicated the feedback and response that he's had as well.

In my summing up, allow me to address some of the queries that have been made, if I can in the time available. I'll do my level best to do so.

Regarding my shadow, Ella Haddad, section 19 was amended so that a person who has a registration refused or cancelled in another jurisdiction may only reapply for registration in Tasmania if they are eligible to reapply for registration in that other jurisdiction.

There was a query about Laurel House on exceptional circumstances. I believe Dr Woodruff also made this query. The advice I have is that the children's commissioner also commented on this being part of the current test if a person has been previously cancelled. The children's commissioner did not say the test was problematic, but the key issue was if a person became eligible to reapply interstate the bill therefore no longer applies an exceptional circumstance test for interstate reapplications.

The existing exceptional circumstance test does allow for matters outside interstate cancellations such as a Tasmanian conviction for an offence that was overturned, so there's an example, if I could draw that to your attention. However, submissions on the issue will be considered as part of the ongoing work to harmonise risk assessment processes under the SCAG agreement. Thank you for those queries.

Regarding the shadow attorney's queries about data sharing nationally, the National Reference System (NRS) is administered by the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. It records all negative working with children check decisions made by state and territory screening units, apart from the Northern Territory, which is yet to be connected to the National Reference System. I'm sure they are working on it.

Tasmania's Registration for Working with Vulnerable People IT system does weekly sweeps of the NRS for decisions relevant to applicants and registrants in the Registration for Working with Vulnerable People system. When matches are found, relevant mutual recognition or risk assessment processes can be proceeded with accordingly. It was a good question and hopefully that satisfies the honourable member and the Chamber accordingly.

Dr Woodruff also asked about the consultation period. I take your comments relevant to government more generally. I take my job very seriously, as I believe you and others know. The SCAG meeting was on 15 August and the communique is on the public record. I quoted from the communication in terms of it being urgent to get this legislation through this year. We have worked pretty hard, along with the Department of Justice, for which I am grateful.

I thank Shannon Filby and Tim Vaatstra, who are here, and Bruce Patterson as well, who many of you know already. Thank you so much for your support. There has been quite a bit of fast work to respond to the SCAG agreement to deliver this legislation by the end of the year. Yes, we did have just those couple of weeks of consultation. I acknowledge that. It was a tight timeframe. We received a late submission from the Children's Commissioner, which we have taken on board and responded to.

There has been, I would say, all shoulders to the wheel to get this legislation to the place where we have today; introduced on Tuesday, and here we are debating today. I'm grateful for the priority that has been placed on this bill by this Chamber and hopefully the Parliament of Tasmania.

Regarding Dr Woodruff's remarks more generally, I take my role seriously and try and support adequate consultation, particularly in respect of comprehensive or important bills. You can hold me to that in future weeks, months and years. I appreciate your feedback because we need to get it right. There will be plenty more bills to come, as the honourable member for Franklin has indicated, in a whole range of law reform areas. Watch this space. There is more coming our way in the not-too-distant future.

Dr Woodruff - Great. Thank you.

Mr BARNETT - There was a reference to Laurel House querying how to respond to suspension arising from foreign or malicious intent, I think Dr Woodruff made reference to that. Based on advice I have, decisions made under new section 1B are not included as reviewable decisions under section 53. This is because it would be inappropriate for TASCAT to review a decision made in another jurisdiction. If a person believed their cancellation arose from a malicious complaint, they could seek review in that jurisdiction.

Similarly, the mandatory cancellation of a registration following a disqualifying offence is not reviewable under the current act. I am advised it is considered more appropriate that the person appeal the decision in the originating jurisdiction and then, if permitted under section 19, reapply in Tasmania.

I am also advised that the proposed amendments to subsection 4 of section 19 allow a person who has had their registration cancelled or refused via mutual recognition to reapply if they are eligible to apply for registration under the corresponding law in the equivalent category that has been refused or cancelled so, if permitted to reapply, the person would then be subject to a risk assessment in Tasmania in the usual way.

There is one other matter I wanted to respond to for Dr Woodruff. This response is also to my shadow attorney-general in terms of education and training, and Dr Woodruff asked about communication. We appreciate submissions on this. We have established consultative networks, a revamped website, a regular newsletter. We will be utilising these and other measures to provide education material and also respond to Laurel House and others on the matters they raise. I acknowledge Laurel House, their submission and their very good work in Tasmania. 

Dr Woodruff - Would you also contact Volunteering Tasmania?

Mr BARNETT -  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.4_D=28.9_C=0.85] More than happy to do so. 

Dr Woodruff - This is in terms of actively letting them know.

Mr BARNETT - The answer is yes and thank you for the question.

These amendments are part of a broader framework of reforms currently being led by SCAG in relation to working with children checks. Tasmania will continue to contribute to the development of these very important reforms, which aim to strengthen protection for children and achieve greater consistency between working with children checks across various jurisdictions. These items are on the agenda [Bookmark: Phr3_O=58.4_D=24.6_C=0.80]  for the next SCAG meeting, which is at the end of next week. SCAG will be getting an update on this particular matter. I will be able to inform them, all being well, of progress today if that is to eventuate. Harmonisation across all jurisdictions is an ongoing piece of work through SCAG and there will be a lot more work to do in this space.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=83.8_D=4.1_C=0.80] That pretty much sums it up. Again, I [Bookmark: Phr5_O=88.9_D=29.1_C=0.85]  thank the honourable members for their considerable thought, observations and feedback on this important matter. It is part of a suite of legislation. This week we passed the Commission for Children and Young People legislation, the establishment of the Commission, which is a milestone event. There is a lot of law reform happening in this place. This is a key piece of the puzzle. I commend the bill to the House and I thank all [Bookmark: Phr6_O=118.3_D=4.7_C=0.79]  honourable members.

Second Reading

[3.04 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Treasurer) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the bill be now read the second time.

Today, the 2025-26 State Budget is presented. As a government, we are confident, indeed convinced, that Tasmania's future continues to be bright. Tasmania's resources of people and nature's bounty ensure no challenge is too great and no challenge can erode the positive future that is ours. That is why our budget looks to the future with realistic optimism and a dedicated sense of purpose, building on the success of the past decade. This is a budget that balances our strong economic and social achievements with a clear need to respond to the challenges we face.

In recent years, Tasmanians have witnessed the creation of more jobs and deeper investment in their wellbeing than ever before. Responsible governments must never lose sight of their core duty to manage the public finances wisely so that the next generation inherits both opportunity and stability.

COVID and the two recent regrettable early state elections, along with a federal election thrown in for good measure and the commission of inquiry compensation payments have all conspired to make the task of returning to pre-COVID expenditure levels more pressing and more challenging. This challenge has been further exacerbated by the need to square up to the added difficulties of global uncertainties, volatile interest rates and federal government neglect, together with cost-of-living pressures. We are not immune from those factors, and they are largely beyond our control. Our historic low unemployment has seen over 51,000 more of our fellow Tasmanians gain jobs over the past decade - a fundamental social good as much if not more than it is an economic good.

Today's budget is an interim budget. It has been prepared under a significantly compressed timeframe due to the timing of the 2025 state election. Despite that real obstacle, it is a budget that gets on with the job of delivering for Tasmania. The 2026-27 Budget, to be brought down in May next year, will mark the next phase in Tasmania's ongoing need for fiscal reform.

Tasmania's economy continues to perform well. We are leading the nation with an unemployment rate of 4 per cent, the lowest in Australia and well below the Tasmanian long-term average. Further, Tasmania's unemployment rate is forecast to remain close to its current record low, averaging around 4 per cent over the next two years. Tasmania has weathered a challenging economic environment over recent years, with high inflation, rising interest rates and global instability, from which Tasmania is not immune. Nevertheless, our economy has continued to grow. Real wages have grown. Wages grew by 3.1 per cent in the June quarter compared to the previous year. 

Targeted electricity rebates, energy bill relief and the state's supercharged Renewable Energy Dividend have all contributed to easing cost pressures for households which has, in turn, improved household purchasing power and supported consumer confidence.

In 2023-24, Tasmania's economy grew by 1.4 per cent, in line with the national rate. At $40.6 billion, the Tasmanian economy is now the largest it has ever been. Importantly, Tasmania's gross state product per capita grew by 1 per cent in 2023-24, while the national figure declined. Over the last decade, this growth equates to $8.5 billion, or 26.3 per cent.

Over the past seven years, Tasmania has been the strongest growing state economy in Australia. Despite global shocks from COVID to disruptions in tariffs and trade, we have achieved consistent broad-based growth. State final demand increased by 3.8 per cent to a record of $50.1 billion in 2024-25. Overall growth of 1 per cent is expected in 2025-26, rising to 2.25 per cent in 2026-27.

Exports remain a cornerstone of Tasmania's prosperity. In 2024-25, international exports totalled $6 billion. This was around 20 per cent higher than a decade ago. Non-ferrous metals, ores and aquaculture continue to lead in strengthening our economy. Tourism has also returned to strength, with visitor numbers now exceeding pre-pandemic levels and over 80 per cent of visitors coming from interstate and growth in international arrivals, particularly from the United States, the United Kingdom and Asia. Our visitor economy supports one in six Tasmanian jobs and one in three in our regions, as Minister Howlett reminded me recently, making it a very valuable sector to the Tasmanian economy. This Budget will enable Tourism Tasmania to maintain consistent marketing [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=29.9_C=0.82]  investment to drive visitation and support the 2030 Visitor Economy Strategy.

Tasmania's economy remains stable and strong, with the economy expected to grow. Yet beneath this resilience, there are structural fiscal issues we must address. The impact of external shocks, the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with rising service delivery costs, particularly in the [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.3_D=6.4_C=0.73]  delivery of health services and a tight labour market, have placed sustained pressure on our Budget. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=67.2_D=14.6_C=0.89]  Nationally, at both state and federal levels, governments are grappling with the same forces - higher wages, supply chain constraints and the ongoing cost of meeting community expectations for essential services.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=82.3_D=29.7_C=0.86] In Tasmania, these pressures have translated into higher recurrent operating expenditure, particularly in health and education. Since 2024-25, investment in health rose by 12 per cent to $14.5 billion and in education by 5 per cent to $9.9 billion. These are essential investments that support Tasmanians today [Bookmark: Phr6_O=112.2_D=2.7_C=0.66]  and build capacity for tomorrow. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=116.7_D=8.6_C=0.93]  

This government has made record levels of investment in health, education, police and public safety since coming to office. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=125.6_D=8.9_C=0.87]  We have worked hard to improve our infrastructure assets, making intergenerational investments for future generations of Tasmanians. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=135.1_D=15.5_C=0.90]  This is underscored with funding of $3.4 billion for infrastructure over four years across the general government sector and a further $1.7 billion in equity funding to support infrastructure investment [Bookmark: Phr10_O=150.7_D=25.5_C=0.87]  by government businesses and other entities. On our state road and bridge network alone, the government will invest $1.6 billion, with a further $696 million on hospitals and other health infrastructure and more than $300 million on schools. 

We remain committed to delivering 10,000 new homes before 2032 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=177.0_D=3.4_C=0.88] , with over $600 million budgeted to achieve this target. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=182.3_D=29.4_C=0.83]  

Significant support is provided for government businesses in key projects, such as $130 million towards Tasmanian Irrigation tranche 3 projects and $191 million in an equity contribution to TasNetworks' North West Transmission Developments. 

Equity funding of $609 million is provided over four years for the Macquarie Point multipurpose stadium, including the Australian [Bookmark: Phr13_O=212.4_D=25.6_C=0.86]  Government and AFL injections of funding. The stadium will not only be uniquely Tasmanian; it presents an exciting opportunity for Tasmania and all Tasmanians to fully engage in the well-recognised stadium economy from which we have been excluded for far too long. The multipurpose stadium [Bookmark: Phr14_O=238.5_D=4.7_C=0.65] , while an imperative to the state receiving a licence for our very own Tasmania  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=243.5_D=27.1_C=0.82] Devils to compete in the AFL, presents opportunities that are so much broader, offering unique function spaces for conventions, cultural and community events and a broad range of concerts, sporting codes and exhibitions on a scale never before possible. This is in addition to the economic enabler the stadium will provide for private investment. Realising this and more [Bookmark: Phr17_O=273.9_D=15.9_C=0.90]  with federal and AFL financial support is an opportunity which needs to be grasped with both hands. 

During construction, the project is expected to add $269 million to our economy over  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=289.9_D=15.0_C=0.83] five years and create at least 1500 direct and indirect jobs. Once operational, the stadium is expected to add around $30 million each year to the Tasmanian economy and support approximately 200 jobs on an ongoing basis. The eyes of Australia - and in some cases, the world - are on us to see if we have the ambition, the courage and the capacity to lay hold of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Success at Macquarie Point will open as many doors for our state, and especially our young, as failure will slam shut. Let's embrace that which beckons. 

The government is committed to creating employment opportunities. We're extending the payroll tax rebate scheme for apprentices for an additional 12 months to 30 June 2026. New funding is being provided for the online business advice platform and Tasmanian Business Advice Service, continuing our support for Tasmania's vibrant and jobs-rich small business sector. 

We're pleased to have delivered record investment in health and remain committed to building an even better health system. The Budget provides over $915 million to meet increased demand for health and mental health services. We're also delivering our elective surgery four-year plan, released earlier this year, with over $70 million allocated in this Budget. This will ensure we can continue to deliver record volumes of elective surgeries, as we have done now for three consecutive financial years, and ensure more Tasmanians get their elective surgery sooner.

The Budget also locks in $7.5 million for additional diagnostic breast imaging clinics to provide statewide public diagnostic mammography services to improve accessibility and reduce waiting times for all Tasmanians, which in turn alleviates the psychological, health, physical and financial impacts of breast cancer diagnosis and intervention.

Our strong commitment to education, children and young people continues in this Budget, with over $9.9 million invested over four years. The government is committed to providing the best possible facilities for our nearly 57,000 learners across the state to achieve the highest quality education. This Budget includes over $294 million for education facilities including schools, teacher accommodation and child and family learning centres. We are supporting over 8600 students with disability, with $10 million to support the delivery of education. 

We also need to ensure that our emergency services have the powers, tools and support they need to keep Tasmanians safe. We're investing $3.7 million in police protective equipment and safety enhancements, with new firefighting equipment, vehicles and capital upgrades, with an additional $2.5 million for a reinvigorated volunteer infrastructure investment fund for both the Tasmania Fire Service and State Emergency Service. We salute the service of our volunteers and thank them.

Members - Hear, hear.

Mr ABETZ - The government continues its investment in justice, corrections and rehabilitation initiatives designed to keep Tasmanians safe and ensure access to justice. This includes funding for programs to reduce reoffending and to continue family violence offender intervention programs.

We are committed to the delivery of a new youth justice facility. Further, we're providing over $4 million of funding to support community youth justice, early intervention and diversionary services, and have allocated $1.5 million over two years to support new local initiatives and partnerships that offer innovative place-based solutions that seek to target the root causes of youth offending.

This Budget also continues our strong support for sport and active recreation by investing in grassroots and elite sport, with targeted support for community sporting infrastructure, participation initiatives and programs that encourage inclusion and equal opportunity in sport.

We are backing community-led solutions through programs such as the Neighbourhood Houses, the Community Connector program, the Food Relief and Food Resilience Strategy and support for financial counselling, family support and the No-Interest Loans Scheme.

This Budget delivers real outcomes for Tasmania. We are delivering for primary producers, continuing the Agriculture Research and Development Fund, driving world-class innovation on Tasmanian farms and helping us reach our goal of a $10 billion agricultural sector by 2050. We are supporting farmers, water users and fishers through programs like the Rural Water Use Strategy, ongoing investment in irrigation, Seafood Industry Biotoxin Support and a road map for digital transition in our wild catch fisheries, ensuring sustainable, productive industries that underpin jobs across regional Tasmania.

We are backing our natural and cultural heritage with additional funding for Aboriginal Heritage Tasmania, support for the Aboriginal Land Council of Tasmania and measures to prevent delays in heritage assessments.

In our parks and reserves, the government is sustaining the very places that inspire us as Tasmanians and attract visitors from around the world. We are investing $7.6 million in Parks operational support and major upgrades to visitor infrastructure, from the Next Iconic Walk to Freycinet, Mount Field and Maria Island, ensuring these treasured locations are safe, accessible and sustainable for generations to come.

In 2025-26, total revenue for the general government sector is estimated at $9.5 billion. The state's income is derived primarily from Australian Government grants, which make up over two-thirds of total revenue, alongside state-sourced taxation such as payroll tax, land tax and duties. The largest revenue source, the Goods and Services Tax, is highly sensitive to national consumer spending, population share and GST relativities determined by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Just a 1 per cent change in the GST pool or Tasmania's relativity could result in revenue shifts of about $38 million and $20 million respectively. The potential consequences are real, very real. We are all in this together, and this means each and every Tasmanian, especially those serving in this place, need to put Tasmania's interests first in our justified advocacy for a fair go from Canberra. The revised GST distribution arrangements under the 2018 federal legislation pose a risk to Tasmania's revenue. The current No Worse Off Guarantee expires in 2029-30, and its non-renewal could result in substantial revenue loss. The government is actively engaging in the 2026 Productivity Commission inquiry to advocate for fair GST treatment. This is an area in which all of us in this place need to pull together. 

Australian Government payments for specific purposes, second only to GST in revenue importance, are also at risk due to uncertain long-term agreements, particularly in health and disability services. The Tasmanian Government is fighting to ensure the federal government meets its funding commitments under the National Health Reform Agreement. Again, we need all in this place to put Tasmania first.

For too long, the federal government has chronically underfunded Tasmania's health system. In 2023, National Cabinet agreed that the federal government would increase its health funding to 45 per cent over a maximum 10-year glide path from 1 July 2025, alongside a more generous funding cap. Over the next five years, Tasmanians face a $673 million shortfall to their health funding if the federal government does not increase its contribution to health funding to the 45 per cent level it should be paying. This is equivalent to 1.2 million emergency department presentations. The importance of being united to achieve a fair, reasonable and just outcome in health cannot be overstated.

Additional revenue streams include returns from government business enterprises and state-owned companies, investment income, and a range of fees, fines and charges for public services. That said, returns from government businesses are sensitive to market conditions, reform programs and policy decisions. A small number of entities, predominantly the energy businesses and the Motor Accident Insurance Board, provide the greatest returns, making the budget vulnerable to performance changes in individual businesses. This demonstrates the need to have our businesses perform to their very best. The government's business reform program is focused on doing exactly that. 

Our fiscal strategy seeks to maintain a stable and diversified revenue base, ensuring that temporary fluctuations in one source, particularly federal government funding, do not undermine the delivery of essential services. Total expenditure in 2025-26 is forecast at $10.5 billion, reflecting the government's commitment to delivering high-quality services for Tasmanians.

The largest areas of spending remain health, education, and public order and safety, which together account for more than 68 per cent of total outlays. Significant investment is also directed toward housing and community amenities, environmental protection and general public services. While these services support wellbeing and opportunity across the state, they also underscore the importance of continued fiscal discipline and structural reform to ensure that the delivery of these services remains sustainable over the long term.

Workers compensation costs are rising dramatically, driven by increased claims and psychological injury prevalence. The Tasmanian Risk Management Fund's liabilities have prompted significant budget allocations. Supplementary appropriation of $105 million was provided in 2021-22, with this Budget providing a further $183 million. It is noted that other state governments of a different political hue are now legislating to staunch this haemorrhaging of their state budgets.

Public sector wage outcomes are a major expenditure risk as well. A 1 per cent increase above the budget of 2.5 per cent wage indexation could cost an additional $250 million over three years, with public sector wages contributing over 46 per cent of total operating expenditure, current demands are simply unattainable. Wages is the single largest operating cost of the general government sector. Excessive wage requests have real consequences for fellow workers and Tasmanian taxpayers, whereas reasonable requests are manageable.

The general government sector superannuation liability is currently estimated to be almost $7 billion and the cost to service the defined benefit superannuation scheme is around $400 million annually. This remains a shameful legacy issue of those opposite who squandered the $1.5 billion of funds set aside for this purpose in a vain attempt to balance their budget.

The net operating balance is forecast to record a deficit of $1 billion, a modest improvement from the previous year. The fiscal balance deficit, which includes capital expenditure, is expected to be $1.4 billion. Our strict, necessary and achievable fiscal strategy projects a return to a net operating surplus, albeit marginal, of $5.6 million by 2028-29.

Without the future-proofing actions the government will implement, the general government net debt has been forecast to grow to $13 billion by 2027-28 as outlined in the Pre-election Financial Outlook report in June 2025.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=15.2_D=14.3_C=0.90] Given that certain people sent the state to an early election on the premise of the urgency of budget repair, the government looks forward to working with all members in this place to turn their political advocacy  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=29.7_D=16.2_C=0.81] into real, demonstrable action. The government has made a clear and principled decision to bring the budget back to balance and reduce debt over the medium term. Our goal for the May 2026 Budget  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=46.1_D=12.2_C=0.83] is simple and measurable: to reach peak debt, the point at which annual borrowing stop increasing by the end of the forward Estimates and to begin paying debt down thereafter.  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=59.9_D=24.3_C=0.85] 

The government remains strongly committed to maintaining our competitive tax regime with state taxes to be efficient, fair, simple and stable with no further taxes to be introduced. 

We need to be both responsible, economic and fiscal managers while ensuring sustainable service provision in our key areas of responsibility.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=85.2_D=4.4_C=0.89] We need to examine those areas that are discretionary spending  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=90.1_D=6.4_C=0.87] and those that fall within the clear responsibility of the federal government, such as health.  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=97.3_D=29.1_C=0.85] 

Our approach is guided by three interlinking core principles. First, to protect services such as health, education and community safety. To continue to achieve this goal, we will secondly drive efficiency. We will deliver better results for every dollar of taxpayers' money spent. That means reducing duplication, improving procurement, managing leases and offices more efficiently, [Bookmark: Phr9_O=126.6_D=5.5_C=0.83]  tightening discretionary spending across government and right-sizing our public service.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=133.1_D=7.9_C=0.92] None of this will occur without the third principle of strengthening accountability and transparency.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=142.6_D=28.2_C=0.88] The government has established an Efficiency in Productivity Unit. The unit will conduct performance audits, identify inefficiencies and assist agencies to deliver savings without undermining service quality. Indeed, all of us can play a role, especially those who are engaged on a daily basis in serving the public by identifying areas for improvement.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=171.6_D=27.6_C=0.85] Agencies will be provided practical assistance to review core functions, consolidate programs and reprioritise spending. This is a sensible and calibrated approach. It is one that reinforces a fundamental principle of responsible government: that public money must be spent wisely, purposefully and with objectively measurable benefits to the community.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=201.0_D=29.4_C=0.84] 

In February 2026, Treasury will release a fiscal sustainability report as requested by the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007. This will provide a comprehensive assessment of the state's financial outlook, including the long-term implications of current policies and expenditure patterns. The publication of this report will be brought forward from June 2026  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=230.6_D=29.9_C=0.85] to February 2026 to inform the development of a new fiscal strategy for inclusion in the May 2026-27 Budget. That strategy will set clear, measurable targets for debt reduction, operating surpluses and expenditure, reflecting the lessons of recent years. Objectively, the sustainability of a state's finances is a prerequisite to economic stability.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=262.4_D=24.6_C=0.82] The savings measures the government will be implementing will be proportionate to the size of the challenge and the strength of the Tasmanian economy. With gross state product forecast to grow to $41.1 billion in 2025-26 and returning to trend over the forward Estimates, the reductions in expenditure are both manageable and responsible.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=287.3_D=4.1_C=0.78] The government is continuing to work with the Multi-Partisan Budget  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=291.7_D=13.0_C=0.81] Consultation Panel. This panel provides a forum for constructive engagement between government and crossbench members on the long-term issues within the state's finances. The government is encouraged by the crossbench's genuine interest, while noting the opposition's refusal to engage in the panel.

This Budget is investing in the services of health, education and community safety that Tasmanians rightly expect and need. It makes vital capital investments to support the construction of intergenerational and economy-enabling infrastructure. In addition, the government is acting decisively to ensure the long-term sustainability of our budgetary position. We are deepening the culture of efficiency, accountability and reform across the public sector which Tasmanians rightly expect as an ongoing process.

This is a government that believes in strong finances, strong services, and strong families, which in turn deliver a strong future for Tasmania. Through discipline, yet sensitive management and clear purpose, we will ensure a balanced budget, confidence for the community, and strength to our state's economy.

Honourable Speaker, as was said in the opening line, Tasmania's future is bright. With these measures, it will continue to be bright, which is why this bill is commended to the House.
