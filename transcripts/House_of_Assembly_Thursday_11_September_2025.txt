DEBATES OF THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY 
 
 
 
 
DAILY HANSARD 
 
 
Thursday 11 September 2025
Preliminary Transcript 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
This draft transcript of debates is issued in advance of the final Hansard for the use of the members of the House of Assembly and copies made from this may not be protected by parliamentary privilege. 
 






Thursday 11 September 2025

The Speaker, Mrs Petrusma, took the Chair at 10.00 a.m., acknowledged the Traditional People and read Prayers.


STATEMENT BY SPEAKER

Absence of Minister - Mrs Archer

Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I wish to advise the House that Minister Archer is required to be absent from the Chamber today. As a result, I will take questions on ministerial portfolios of Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing; Ageing; and Aboriginal Affairs.


STATEMENT BY SPEAKER

Parliamentary Behavioural Standards

The SPEAKER - Thank you. Before calling on Question Time, I appreciate that today is Thursday and everyone is a little bit tireder than they were on Tuesday and Wednesday, but I want to make a statement to the House in relation to behavioural standards, particularly during question time. While Question Time is a time for robust debate, and I do not intend to curtail this, at times the interjections and conversations between members across the Chamber become disorderly. I remind members that when they ask a question they need to allow the minister to answer without interjection. It also helps Hansard in recording the comments more accurately. If a member is not satisfied with the answer, they can ask a supplementary question or use other forms of the House to pursue this. 

I will continue to issue warnings to members who continually interject and interrupt proceedings, and while I do not wish to suspend any member from the House, if a member is persistently disruptive to the whole Chamber, I will have no hesitation to do so. I also ask members to be mindful of the Motion for Respect report, which highlighted the importance of this Chamber being a safe place for all members. 


QUESTIONS

Education Facility Staff - Job Security Agreement

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.04 a.m.]
Your budget mismanagement is catching up with you. Yesterday, I asked why your government is dragging its feet in negotiations with an agreement for our courageous firefighters, but it's our hardworking school cleaners, groundspeople and kitchen assistants who are now so frustrated in trying to negotiate with your government over their new job security agreement that you have the very serious risk of industrial action on your hands. As a former teacher, I know too well how critical these workers are in ensuring schools are clean and safe for student learning. Are you aware that these workers' attempts to renegotiate a new Job Security Agreement (JSA) with the government have stalled and your ministers seem to be too busy with their own pet projects? Are you and your minister risking school closures by ignoring your workforce and not valuing the work they do? First it was the firies, now we have the education facility attendants. Are these stalled negotiations emblematic of your government, that has failed to invest in essential services and the people who deliver them?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. Can I say, as I said yesterday, how much we value the work of our public service, irrespective of department. The direct answer to your question is that we will engage in good-faith negotiations. I would have liked that engagement to be earlier, but it was emblematic of you forcing us to an election.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr Ferguson - A winter election.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It was a winter election, Mr Ferguson.

Members interjecting.

Mr Willie - They have a resource allocation from 1997.

The SPEAKER - Order, to all members. I just read out a statement saying that you will listen to the honourable minister or Premier making the response in respectful silence, please. The acceptable forms of interjection in this House are 'shame' or 'hear, hear'. I ask this morning that all members are cognisant of that.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will make the point very quickly because it's important to focus on the very good work of people in and across the public service. We have a delayed budget and delayed negotiations, effectively, because we had an election and then another month on top of that in terms of leading up to the no confidence motion on 19 August.

We are engaging now. More specifically to the facility attendants, we all gained a greater appreciation of the work our health staff did, our teachers, as you mentioned, Mr Willie, our facility attendants in our schools through the pandemic. We had a heightened appreciation of the very good work that had been done leading up to the pandemic, the pandemic itself and the very difficult circumstances where there were a lot of unknowns in terms of the pandemic and the effect of COVID and many other things. Not only was it very much appreciated, but also very brave as well.

The Department for Education, Children and Young People and the United Workers Union have been negotiating a replacement job security agreement, as I understand it, for education facility attendants over 2024 and 2025. I understand the negotiations have been difficult and protracted, but we continue to work on finding a mutually agreeable resolution to the process.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - My question to the honourable Premier is when does he plan to resolve negotiations so that our hardworking school cleaners, kitchen attendants and groundspeople can get the fair pay and conditions that they deserve? 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I appreciate the honourable member's supplementary question. The JSA is not a wages agreement but includes specific matters of importance such as the formula for staffing levels and commitments in relation to outsourcing. 

Again, I acknowledge the vital work of the education facility attendants (EFAs) and the work they undertake in our schools. We value all our support staff right across our education system in terms of school sites being safe and hygienic for our learners and other staff. We are in good-faith negotiations. We will continue and we will work hard to resolve the matters as soon as possible.


North West Regional Hospital - Minister's Comments 

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.09 a.m.]
After inheriting $1 billion of net debt when you became Premier, you're now set to rack up $13 billion of net debt, which will see us paying almost $700 million in interest a year. That's more than we spend on ambulance services and emergency departments combined. 

Yesterday, ambulances were told to bypass the North West Regional Hospital because the emergency department can't handle the high levels of demand. At about 2.00 p.m., there were 43 patients at the 12-cubicle emergency department, with 15 waiting for admission to the hospital for further treatment. When asked about the situation, one of your ministers said, 'I would also ask people presenting to the ED to explore their options.' Do you think it's good enough to tell genuine patients who need to visit the emergency department and who are being admitted to 'explore their options'?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his questions. I thank our hard-working health staff who are increasingly facing issues of growing health demand in our community. It highlights how important it is to invest in essential services and how important it is for state and federal governments to work together when it comes to our areas of responsibility. 

We increasingly reach into primary health care services, access to GPs, and other matters, which are the primary responsibility of the federal government. What we're keen to do when it comes to resourcing our health system is to strike a sustainable agreement with the federal government, when it comes to them effectively resourcing, to 45 per cent, our investment in health -

Mr Willie - There are genuine emergency patients being told to 'explore their options'.

The SPEAKER - I ask that the Premier be heard in silence, please.

Mr ROCKLIFF - First ministers and health ministers are united across the country in that we need to work together with the federal government. We expect more from the federal government when it comes to their responsibilities for primary health care and also ensuring the funding and support of our broader health care.

Mr Willie - This is happening in your hospital in your electorate.

The SPEAKER - Honourable Leader of the Opposition, you have the right to ask a supplementary. I do not want to have to give you a warning where it escalates to being ejected from the House. I ask that you let the Premier answer the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Again, I thank very much our hard-working health staff who continue to do an amazing job in our community. I reassure anyone needing emergency care that if you turn up to an ED, you will be seen and our staff will be there to care for you.

The North West Regional Hospital is currently experiencing high levels of demand. That happens from time to time across our acute care health system and our four major health centres, and more recently in other centres as well. Our hospitals, including the North West Regional Hospital, have well-established escalation procedures to manage surge periods. It is common for our hospitals to work together as one health system during these periods to ensure patients receive the right care in the right place at the right time. 

I believe we've also had challenges at the Launceston General Hospital with unplanned sick leave, which has further exacerbated problems in those areas. That happens from time to time as well. When it does happen, there are escalation procedures.

Once again, I thank the health staff for working through peak demands on their services.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Does the Premier agree with his minister that Tasmanians who are seeking emergency care should 'explore their options'?

The SPEAKER - It does relate to the original question, Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you for your question, honourable member. As I said before, if you need to be supported and cared for in an emergency department, you will be cared for. There's no doubt about that. 

What we do need to ensure is we're investing in other avenues of service delivery, including our urgent care clinics and alleviating the pressure on our emergency departments by alternative access to primary health care services, for example, our commitments during the election, and with the good work of previous health ministers, to broadening the scope of practice for our pharmacies. Our community pharmacies play a vital role when it comes to ensuring that primary healthcare service delivery and also more accessible health services for people in our community and the after-hours commitment, the broader -

AFAC Bushfire Review and Aerial Firefighting Capabilities

Ms BADGER question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

[10.15 a.m.]
Last summer, over 100,000 hectares of Tasmania's national assets were burnt. Last term we asked the Premier to commit to making a review of the fire a public process and to ensure the final report was released to all Tasmanians. That Australian and New Zealand Council for Fire and Emergency Services (AFAC) report was expected to be on your desk in August regardless of the election interruption. With the statewide fire briefing today, there are many questions about the lessons learnt from last year that are held in that AFAC report.

There are also questions on Tasmania's aerial firefighting capacity, with the additional winch needed in the now scrapped budget. We understand, that with the new era medical tender, Tasmania may be down several helicopters from the call when needed register.

Minister, when will you be releasing the AFAC review into last summer's bushfires? Further, what are you doing to ensure our available aerial firefighting assets will be able to defend this island in the coming fire season?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for Lyons for her question. I pay tribute to our incredible firefighters for the work they did over the summer. This was a very large-scale event that occurred on the west coast with the west coast complex of bushfires, more than 100,000 hectares burnt and an extraordinary all-in effort. We had our three fire agencies with the Tasmanian Fire Service, Sustainable Timber Tasmania, our incredible forest firefighters, and the Parks and Wildlife Service. We also had a national and international effort to address those fires. People came from all round the country to help out their mates in Tasmania, just as Tasmanians go interstate and internationally. There were also some New Zealand firefighters, our mates across the Tasman, who did extraordinary work. It was an excellent demonstration of the capability we have here in Tasmania. It was an extraordinary effort for a 100,000-hectare bushfire to be managed as it was.

In any emergency, particularly of that scale, there are things to learn and we're looking forward to that continuous improvement that comes from these reviews. AFAC has been working through that. We're expecting that review to be released very soon and we're looking forward to working through the lessons we can deliver from that. Parks has been the lead agency for these fires, given that 90 per cent of fires occurred on Parks and Wildlife Crown land, but there are opportunities for all of our fire agencies to continue to learn.

In terms of aerial capability, the aero-medical tender is a separate issue to that one. We're looking forward to welcoming the National Aerial Firefighting Centre fleet down this year, just as we did last year. I believe the success of the use of that capability and the way we were able to roll it out in some of the most remote and challenging parts of our state really showed the quantum leap that Tasmania has made in recent years - whether that comes from aerial bombing - water bombing, that is - or from our uplifted winch capability.

I know there were sceptics about the use of winch capability in some of these more remote areas. The briefing that I received from STT and Parks last week at the refresher day really demonstrated that the capability uplift from winching has meant that when we have large scale lightning strikes - like occurred on the west coast with a huge number of lightning strikes, thousands coming through - there are a number of starts that occur in remote areas, often inaccessible by road. We had about 14 key starts that with our winch capability we were able use the rapid weight of attack doctrine to put out at the source.

Supplementary Question

Ms BADGER - A supplementary question, honourable Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I accept the supplementary question.

Ms BADGER - I appreciate that the report is coming soon, when it was supposed to be on your desk in August. I also appreciate the separation from the aeromedical tender. That's because that process has gone from Emergency Services over to the Health department. Can you please explain what we're actually doing in Tasmania with our current aerial firefighting here? Are you asking for extra to be flown in from the national fleet? What are we doing here on the island?

The SPEAKER - The last part of your question is really a new question. The first section of it -

Mr ELLIS - I'm always happy to update, particularly in this area. I really welcome the opportunity to brief the Greens on the National Aerial Firefighting Centre fleet. It is a highly successful part of our program. It is very separate to the aeromedical tender. That's largely a small number of helicopters. It's particularly a police capability, rather than fire. We'll be expecting a significant number of aircraft coming through.

There is a bid process that we work through at a national level, because this capability moves around the country to address the different fire seasons that occur at different times around the nation. Typically as Queensland's fire season is coming off and quietening down, Tasmania is ramping up. We work closely with our federal counterparts and our interstate jurisdictions to ensure that we have the right capability at the right time, just as we do every year. We've demonstrated the success of that through the extraordinary effort in response to the 100,000 hectare west coast complex bushfires. I update the House that all of our firefighters -

Short-Stay Accommodation in Hobart

Ms JOHNSTON question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.21 a.m.]
The latest figures on the number of short-stay accommodations in Hobart shows a worrying continuation of the long-term upward trend. More short-stay rentals reduce supply in the long-term rental market, and drive up rents. The figures show a 23 per cent increase in the number of whole homes in Hobart that otherwise might be available for rent that are now being used for short stay accommodation. That's an increase of 117 homes in the 12-month period to September last year, taking it to 627 homes. Do you acknowledge the market has failed and we have the balance wrong between providing homes for Tasmanians and the right amount of short-stay options for tourists?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. There has been some discussion within the community for some time. I note various policy positions from other parties with respect to these matters, including our own commitment for an Airbnb levy as an example, which we will implement.

Tasmania has one of the clearest planning policies short stay accommodation, I'm advised, with flexible planning rules and data collection to support and inform local policy. I'm advised any council that has a case to support further limits on short stay accommodation can apply local restrictions with the approval of the independent Tasmanian Planning Commission. Our approach, in my view - albeit we are willing to listen on further ideas - is fair, consistent, and simply to administer compared with that of other jurisdictions, which place a limit on the number of nights that short stay accommodation can operate in a year. In support of our balanced planning regulations, we are extending the land tax exemptions for those who switch from short-stay accommodation to a longer-term rental. They are trying to address the matters that I believe you have raised here today. We will also seek to incentivise the return of some properties to the longer-term rental market to boost housing supply by providing a one-year land tax exemption to property owners who convert a property from short-stay to long-term rental. These are some of the areas where we can support the concerns that you have or, indeed, address them.

Other matters, more broadly, include the need to build more homes and incentivise more investment in homes and construction of homes. We have a range of policy areas and commitments to address that matter and those will be part of the budget this year, which has already been further announced by our Treasurer in terms of encouraging more construction of new homes and we look forward to that. Thank you very much for the question and I look forward to further ideas that you may well present, Ms Johnston. 


Short-Stay Levy - Funds Allocation to Homelessness Services

Mr O'BYRNE question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[10.25 a.m.]
At the outset, let me acknowledge the work of the cross-parliament budget panel and your commitment to open discussions on matters relating to the budget, but that does not mean we are unable to raise issues in parallel. There are now more than 8000 Tasmanian properties listed as short-stay accommodation. This is having an impact on housing availability for many Tasmanians. You have previously promised a short-stay levy but a levy will not go far towards fixing the state budget. However, if the funds were quarantined for homelessness services, this measure could make a real difference.

This is a sensible revenue-raising measure to help fund essential services. When I last asked the Premier about the promised levy, he said the government was waiting to see how a similar levy worked in Victoria. Treasurer, when will you implement the levy and will you guarantee to quarantine the funds to homelessness services?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thought the introduction to his question was too good to be true and that there would be a 'but', and sure enough, it came. In relation to the short-stay accommodation levy, the government is committed to that. Consultation prior to the levy's planned implementation is expected to begin later this year and, as we know, we have had some diversions in recent times where government has been in caretaker. That said, we are getting on with it. 

We expect to raise about $11 million from that levy and we did indicate that the money would go towards supporting first home buyers. That will assist more people to be able to buy homes and therefore, down the chain, assist in relation to the issue that you raised, namely homelessness. We have committed the $11 million already to first home buyers.

The government has been closely monitoring the introduction of a similar levy in Victoria from 1 January this year and the ACT from 1 July this year. When we announced our levy at the 2024 state election, it was about making it easier for Tasmanians to own their own home - 5 per cent short-stay levy. It was in that context that we were raising the levy, so I can't make the promise that you seek from me, but you can be assured, as I said yesterday as well, that given the tough times that we face in relation to the need for budget repair, it will have all the characteristics of good economic management, along with compassion.



Surgery Wait List

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.28 a.m.]
You came to office 11 years ago promising that Tasmania would be the healthiest state in Australia by 2025. After 11 years in government, you've thrown billions of dollars into hospitals, yet outcomes keep getting worse. Tasmanians are now waiting longer and longer for surgery. Today, there are 9000 Tasmanians on the waiting list for elective surgery and 66,000 Tasmanians on a waiting list to see a specialist. Take the case of Ally Hart, a 57-year-old music teacher who's been told she has to wait up to 800 days for a hip replacement despite being classed as semi-urgent and unable to work or even walk more than a few steps. 

How can Tasmanians trust you to deliver a healthier Tasmania when you've broken promises, wrecked the budget, riddled Tasmanians with eye-watering debt and now have Eric Abetz in charge of sacking public servants? If you do have an answer, why haven't you already acted to prevent people like Ally from suffering on the waiting list for years?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I empathise with Ally's circumstances and many people who are on a waiting list for an extended period of time. We have worked very hard over the course of the last 11 years with increasing investment in our health system to the tune of $10 million every single day. By the end of this three-day session of parliament, we would have invested $30 million into our health system. 

To the broader point of health funding, we do need - between me and you and our respective Health ministers, and indeed others - to have a united approach to the federal government to more fairly fund our health system nationally. The commitment was 45 per cent and we must simply address those matters. There are matters about the NDIS too, which we need to work through further. That is very important. 

What is also important is to ensure we are investing further into access to primary healthcare services to ensure that people are supported for their healthcare needs in a primary healthcare setting, whether it be a pharmacy, an urgent care centre or a GP, to alleviate their sickness getting worse, which further exacerbates the challenges within our health system and particularly our emergency departments and our waiting lists. 

The waiting list did reach a high of around 12,200 following the pandemic because we cancelled non-emergency elective surgery. That circumstance prevented people getting the timely health care within the clinically recommended timeframes. We have reduced the waiting lists down to around 8500, I believe. I haven't seen the figures in more recent times. That's been done by the four-year elective surgery plan, which has been patient-focused and, most importantly, clinically led. 

As Health minister, I recall working alongside Marcus Skinner at the time, who was very instrumental in developing that four-year elective surgery plan which was clinically led, and it needed to be. We recommitted to another four-year plan during the election to ensure that the key decisions were being made by those who are experts in their field. 

The SPEAKER - The honourable Premier's time for answering the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - How can Tasmanians trust the Premier to address the elective surgery waiting list when they've been in government for 11 years and outcomes keep getting worse?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Again, the focus should always be on the patient and again I empathise with Ally's circumstances. However, for the second consecutive year, highlighting the investment and the clinically led plan, we have delivered record numbers of elective surgeries in a financial year. We delivered 22,196 elective surgeries in the 2023-24 financial year. The previous year was a record 21,364. The most recent national data for the 23-24 year shows Tasmania had the highest per-capita admission rate for elective surgery of any state or territory at 38.7 admissions per 1000 population, well above the 28.9 admissions per 1000 population. I recognise the circumstances of Ali and many others, and we need to do better.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


National Park Assets Privatisation

Ms BADGER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.34 a.m.]
Recently, millions have been invested into reviving the Hastings Caves visitor experience, and in the last budget $7.8 million was allocated to making Mount Field a year-round destination. No further explanation of the specifics of that investment were provided. We now understand that funding is going toward the renewal of the park's public government huts.

Given your record of privatising our national parks, there is deep concern that the Mount Field huts and Hastings Caves may be leased out to a private commercial operator after millions of public funds have been spent on them. Premier, will you today rule out handing over these beloved publicly-owned assets, inside protected areas, to private commercial operators?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for your question. I will need to seek further detail of the question. Of course, at face value you've asked me to rule out, but I won't. I will need to see and seek further information. At face value, I don't see any massive issue here in terms of a private operator operating efficiently to ensure greater accessibility into the wonderful assets that Tasmania has.

Dr Woodruff - Why can't we do that?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, you've asked a question, I ask that the Premier be heard in silence. You can ask a supplementary. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am not philosophically challenged by your question at all, which is why I'm not ruling it out.

Members interjecting.

Dr Broad - He believes in privatisation.

The SPEAKER - Order, Dr Broad. The honourable Premier has the call. He's already indicated he's going to take the answer on notice.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, honourable Speaker. Honourable member for Franklin, Mr Winter, you're in no position to talk about positions of privatisation.

Mr Winter - What's your position today, mate?

Mr ROCKLIFF - We know your position, honourable member Dean Winter.

Ms Finlay - Where do you stand? 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Alright, okay. Can I simply say that I won't be ruling it out, Ms Badger. I accept your view. I happen to believe that we need to encourage entrepreneurship and our tourism sector and our hospitality sector -

Ms Finlay - Privatisation back on the agenda.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Opposition, you can ask a question soon.

Mr ROCKLIFF -  so many more people from around the globe can experience the wonderful natural assets that Tasmania has.

Ms BADGER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms BADGER - The Premier will happily provide you with more information on that. What you can rule out is that you will not allow private operators to have those assets leased out outside of the EOI process.

The SPEAKER - The EOI process wasn't mentioned in your original question.

Ms BADGER - I forgot the ruling; it was worth a try.

Members interjecting.


Royal Hobart Hospital - Nurses in Surgical Ward

Mr GEORGE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.37 a.m.]
Why is it that your government has been so tardy in employing urgently-needed nurses in the Royal Hobart Hospital surgical ward that their union has been forced to take this matter to the Tasmanian Industrial Commission? This is not a matter of wages; it is actually a matter of saving lives and of patient dignity. Why is it the Health department is so inefficient or so under resourced that the union is forced to take urgent matters of this nature to the commission?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for your question. Indeed, the great interest in this matter and health has been the topic of discussion for a large part of Question Time today. What I can assure the honourable member is that we are, and have been, actively recruiting health staff consistently over the course of a number of years. The last few years post-pandemic would demonstrate that we've had large increases when it comes to health professionals more broadly. In more recent times, I believe it was about 2200 or so extra health professionals in the last couple of years - I stand to be corrected on that figure, but a significantly increased amount. This is a reflection of the demand. I haven't got the detail on the circumstances within the area that you speak of. I'm happy to provide that detail to the House at a later time.

Mr George, I understand the circumstances and the pressures within the health system, right across the health system. We have been in very active recruitment mode previously when it comes to these matters. I do appreciate the work and the round table. When I was Health minister, I believe the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Foundation (ANMF), the Health and Community Services Union (HACSU), the Australian Medical Association (AMA) and others worked very hard around this matter, certainly the ANMF and the AMA. That needs to continue. I will take the question on notice and provide more detail if I can and get back to you. But that's my answer.

Supplementary Question. 

Mr GEORGE - Speaker, a supplementary question, if I may, briefly.

The SPEAKER - The Premier has taken it on notice.

Mr GEORGE - I would simply like to ask if the Premier would also take on notice my request relating to this parliament, the action he's taking to ensure that these matters don't have to go to the Tasmanian Industrial Commission in the future.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, honourable member. The Department of Health provides nursing staff awards through an agreed tool with the ANMF: the Nursing Hours per Patient Day (NHPPD) agreement. The ANMF also have representation in the development of the NHPPD tool benchmarking. Where there are disputes there are appropriate mechanisms, including a submission to the Tasmanian Industrial Commission, to resolve those disputes, but we are committed to continuing to work collaboratively and in good faith with the staff and the ANMF to address any of these concerns.

I'm advised that the department is in the process of onboarding 5.84 FTE additional assistance in nursing, and has provided the AMF with an implementation plan.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Federal Funding and Housing Plan 

Mr BAYLEY question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[10.41 a.m.]
Treasury's Pre-Election Financial Outlook (PEFO) has identified the significant risk to the already-struggling budget from building a stadium. Your government has consistently claimed that the federal government's $240 million Macquarie Point urban redevelopment contribution will be for the stadium, but the agreement doesn't even mention a stadium. Instead, it explicitly requires affordable and key worker housing. The PEFO says:

To the extent that the Australian Government funding is required to address these matters, it would not be available to fund the construction of the stadium. The state will need to fund any gap, and this represents an unfunded budget risk. [tbc]

Treasurer, your government agreed to deliver a finalised housing plan to the feds by June 2025. Have you done this? If so, can you table it in this House today? What commitments have you received from the Federal Government that the entirety of its $240 million contribution can fund construction of the stadium, or will Tasmanians be saddled with another stadium cost blow out?

The SPEAKER - The member's time for asking the question has expired. The Treasurer doesn't have to answer the last part of that question that was after the time.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, the Deputy Leader of the Greens, along with the Greens, are well known for being opposed to the stadium, and they nod their head in agreement with that, so at least we have that agreed between us. As a result, every single question and move that the Greens, with respect, make in this House is all about trying to criticise the stadium, as is their right, and in trying to ensure that it doesn't occur.

As I understand it, the Premier and the Prime Minister had discussed this. I will stand corrected on this, but my recollection is that the Prime Minister indicated on a recent visit that the $240 million was for the development of the precinct and the federal government was absolutely committed. I stress 'federal Labor government', so we have bipartisan agreement now, not only in this House but also federally, in relation to the development of the precinct.

The PEFO provided by Treasury is there for all to see, read and make comment on. It is appropriate that Treasury provides such information but, as I've said previously in this place, while Treasury and other sources can provide advice, at the end of the day, it is the government and this parliament that decides. We can get advice, they can provide the risks and concerns, but at the end of the day it is the democratically elected people in this place that need to make the decisions for the future of the state. I can't recall any at this stage, but I'm sure that there have been other projects where Treasury may have expressed concerns about risk or whatever; nevertheless, they've proceeded.

We have had varying views in relation to the financial viability of a whole host of issues. Men and women of economics have disagreed in relation to the return the stadium is going to provide. You can pick Dr Nicholas Gruen, KPMG or the Hobart City Council's economic analysis, to which the Lord Mayor said, 'Discard that, ignore that, because we're so supportive of the stadium' - over $170 million worth of economic stimulus just for the Hobart City Council area. Men and women of economics will disagree. It's not an exact science.

The SPEAKER - The Treasurer's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Mr BAYLEY - The Treasurer confirmed that in the conversations with the PM, the $240 million was for the precinct. That's exactly what I said in the question. That's what the agreement says. The real question was, has the federal government given a commitment that the entirety of the $240 million can be spent on the stadium? 

The other part of the question stands: Have you delivered a finalised housing plan, as agreed by June 2025? If so, can you table it in this House today?

The SPEAKER - That does refer to the original question, Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - Honourable Speaker, part of my role, not only as Treasurer but as the Minister for the Macquarie Point Urban Renewal task - if I've got that right - I'm still battling with the title you've given me in relation to that, Premier. It deals with the totality of the precinct. As I understand the Prime Minister's wording, it was in relation to the precinct, but we see the development of the stadium as being fundamental to the development of the precinct. It will be, if you like, the anchor tenant the stadium will be the anchor development for the totality of the precinct.

In relation to the housing plan, I will need to get back in touch with the honourable member and provide that information.


State Budget Management

Mr WINTER question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[10.47 a.m.]
During the election campaign, Treasury was able to tell the truth about the dire state of Tasmania's finances when it released the PEFO. Saul Eslake said that the PEFO was vindication of his review of the state's finances last year, which found that they were on track to be the worst in the nation. Treasury revealed that, under your government, Tasmania is on track to reach $13 billion of net debt with interest repayments of almost $700 million every year. Free from political interference, Treasury said, 'This will reduce the state's ability to manage economic shocks and provide services to the community in the future.' Translation: because of the Liberals' budget management, Tasmanians relying on essential services like health, education and housing will suffer.

Your government already has a plan to cut 2500 public sector workers and earlier this week you said not all previously committed funding will be included. Treasurer, what promises are you planning to break and what services are you looking to cut?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, this comes from the shadow treasurer who was so confident in the ability of his own team that he had to reach out of his team to appoint another shadow treasurer, the honourable member for Murchison, for a nanosecond. That was because the shadow treasurer, whilst he was the leader of the opposition, had no confidence in the then-shadow treasurer, who is now Leader of the Opposition -

Members interjecting.

Mr Willie - Talk about us all you like; Tasmanians want you talking about them.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ABETZ - as a result, he has returned the favour by appointing the former leader of the opposition as the shadow treasurer.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Sorry, Treasurer, I am going to interrupt.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Honourable members to my left, this is a first warning to all of you. I will not hesitate to suspend people in this House. You have asked a question. I ask that the honourable Treasurer be heard in silence. You can ask a supplementary question if it is relevant or you have a few more questions to go. Honourable Treasurer, please resume.

Mr ABETZ - Thank you, Speaker. Might I add, this is from an opposition, now led by a Leader of the Opposition, who failed to produce an alternative budget.

Mr Willie - Answer the question. He's inciting us.

Members interjecting.

Mr ABETZ - I am answering the question, Leader of the Opposition -

The SPEAKER - Honourable Leader of the Opposition, this is your first warning.

Mr ABETZ - You cannot continually come into this place complaining without presenting an alternative. I would have thought you would have learnt that lesson from the result on 19 July.

Mr Mitchell - Do your job.

The SPEAKER - Honourable member for Lyons, this is your first warning too.

Mr ABETZ - You can be full of criticism, but you actually need to provide an alternative.

In relation to the $13 billion debt to which the shadow treasurer referred, that was on the basis of there being no remedial action. Guess what? There will be remedial action. We have been talking about budget repair. If budget repair occurs, it stands to reason that the projected $13 billion will come down. This is the mischief that the Labor Party so often engages in that they only tell half the story and not the full story. What Treasury said was without remedial action -

Ms Finlay - On your guy's side you don't even tell the true story.

The SPEAKER - Ms Finlay, this is your first warning.

Mr ABETZ - which is then translated by the shadow treasurer into 'political interference'. Do you want us to do something or not? If we do rectify, it becomes 'political interference', in the language of the Labor Party, and if we don't do anything, we're being hugely irresponsible. This is another example of the relentless negativity from the opposition.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - Just to repeat the question because the Treasurer didn't go near it: what promises are you breaking and what services will you be cutting?

The SPEAKER - That does refer back to the original question.

Mr ABETZ - Honourable Speaker, much as I'd like to deliver the 6 November budget today, I'm not in a position to do so. You will need to await the outcome of the budget on 6 November as to the details of it.

What I would say, not only to the opposition but to the hapless public that might be listening in to our question time -

Members interjecting.

Mr ABETZ - Well, people who listen in to Question Time, with great respect, what else can you do with your life other than see us at Question Time? 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ABETZ - This government set up a panel for all members of this parliament to partake in, and the government, all the crossbench and the Greens are partaking in it. Who were the absentees?

Dr Broad - The opposition.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, the opposition. The people who moved the no confidence motion about the budget are the ones who won't do anything about it.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Treasurer's time for answering the question has expired.


North West Regional Hospital - Emergency Department

Mr GARLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.53 a.m.]
I too want to ask about the crisis in our North West Regional emergency department. Our emergency departments are bursting at the seams and it is patients who are suffering, as well as staff who are under immense strain. During the election campaign, I threw my support behind adopting the Victorian virtual emergency department model of care, which is seeing up to 1000 patients a day in Victoria online and diverting up to 87 per cent of them from the emergency departments. It has a proven return on investment of $4.70 for every dollar spent. Premier, isn't it time for the government to adopt the Victorian virtual ED model?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. We often get questioned, rightly, on the investments we are making in and around public services across the state, irrespective of department, but particularly the investment in health and funding is vitally important, which is why we need to be very strong advocates when it comes to the National Health Agreement and improvement. in the investment the federal government is making, so there's no doubt that funding is very important.

What is also very important - to your question, honourable member - is what we do with that funding and to ensure that we are always being very innovative when it comes to investment in our health services. Funding is important, but innovation in health is also, I would say, equally important, which is why the example that we use in terms of broadening the scope of practice with our pharmacies, urgent care centres and other areas of access for health are vitally important. We are in furious agreement on that point.

I can advise that a virtual emergency department is currently being developed for implementation in Tasmania in 2026. The virtual emergency department, as you correctly stated, is a Victorian government program which supports health professionals, paramedics, nurses and GPs with access to an emergency medicine specialist. It is a 24/7 statewide virtual emergency care service offering video-based clinical assessments and medical advice for non-life-threatening conditions, accessible via self-referral or various healthcare providers.

I am advised that in 2024 the Victorian service averaged 720 video calls per day, with 88.5 per cent of patients avoiding an ED presentation as a result, so that is another example of an innovation that prevents people having to attend an ED which alleviates the pressure, which is the crux of your question. Work is underway, I understand, to establish formal agreements between the Victorian and Tasmanian departments of health to provide Tasmanians with direct access to the virtual emergency department program and its services in our state: Again, I want to reassure you and indeed anyone needing emergency care that if you turn up to an emergency department, you will be seen and our staff will be there to care for you.

It is important to continue to be innovative and look at other areas across the country as well. I am very proud of our emergency response for people who need mental health support as well, which is working well.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Budget Repair Measures

Mr WINTER question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ 

[10.57 a.m.]
You have stated the budget repair measures already underway will continue. Your government has consistently failed to ensure departments adhere to their allocated budgets, especially the Department of Health, where overspending is chronic. The Preliminary Outcomes Report 2024-25 shows the budget blowouts for expenses related to the Department of Health include a $261.5 million overspend in employee expenses and a $135.3 million overspend in supplies and consumables. What budget repair measures do you plan to implement and how do you ensure your proposed budget repair measures are realised without impacting the delivery of essential services that Tasmanians rely on and without sacking workers?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I detect a bit of jostling between the former leader of the opposition and the current Leader of the Opposition with the questions they're asking. The Leader of the Opposition asked questions in relation to as to why we were not spending more and doing more in relation to the Health budget and now the shadow leader of the opposition is asking questions as to the overspend and why we are spending this inordinate amount of money, the subtext being that we should be cutting and reducing that expenditure. 

Members interjecting.

Ms Finlay interjecting. 

The SPEAKER - Order. Ms Finlay, this is your second warning. 

Mr ABETZ - The opposition cannot have it both ways. They have been relatively good in recent times at speaking out of both sides of their mouths or speaking with a forked tongue.

Members interjecting.

Ms BUTLER - Point of order, Speaker. The member is inciting this side of the room. Would you please ask him to remain relevant?

The SPEAKER - I do ask the honourable Treasurer to answer the question and not incite interjections, please.

Mr ABETZ - Speaker, can I say that the opposition do have personal agency as to whether or not they are incited to interjecting and they can control themselves, I am sure. 

Ms Finlay - Are you reflecting on the Chair?

The SPEAKER - Order, Ms Finlay, you are already on two warnings. I will have no hesitation to suspend you. 

Mr ABETZ - I will seek to be less provocative with my commentary that points out the bleeding obvious: that there is a complete and utter inconsistency in their questions in relation to health today. 

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. Although the Treasurer did just say 'in relation', perhaps he's about to answer the question, can you please draw him back to the question? 

The SPEAKER - He still has one minute and 14 seconds. I am sure he is going to address the question and be relevant.

Mr ABETZ - In relation to the Budget, as I have indicated previously to the honourable member, I will not be indicating today, or indeed any day before 6 November, as to what is going to be in the interim budget. We know the date, we are working on it. We are dealing with issues and health expenditure has been an issue for some considerable time for our budgets, but wouldn't it be good if the opposition were actually on the budget consultative panel, so they could tell us whether they want more spending on Health, according to Mr Willie, or less spending on Health, according to Mr Winter? It would assist me as Treasurer to know what that cohort in the House, the 10 Labor members, would actually wish in the Budget. 

Mr Willie - You caused the mess.

The SPEAKER - Order. 

Mr ABETZ - Speaker, I will not divulge that which is going to be in the interim budget on 6 November.

Macquarie Point Development Corporation Interim Stormwater Assessment Report

Ms BURNET question to MINISTER for MACQUARIE POINT URBAN RENEWAL, Mr ABETZ 

[11.01 a.m.]
In its submission to the Planning Commission on the Macquarie Point stadium, the State Emergency Services criticised the Macquarie Point Development Corporation's interim stormwater assessment report, saying that the report was done in isolation from adjacent catchments to the Hobart Rivulet and the comprehensive report should consider current flows and capacity of the existing stormwater systems. In the May 2018 flood surge, first responders' lives were put at risk in this part of the Hobart Rivulet. Minister, getting this right is a matter of life and death. The SES is concerned. How is the TPC meant to make its assessment on such paucity of information?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I am not exactly sure as to the totality of that question, but the TPC will undoubtedly do its task. I suggest the chances are it has already done its task and is busily finalising its report which will be dropped in six days' time. Our emergency services personnel do a great job. We should ensure, to the very best of our ability, that any unnecessary danger to them is avoided. I am sure that that is forefront in the mind of the TPC and also the Macquarie Point Development Corporation and all those dealing with the development of the precinct. 

However, I remind the honourable member that this industrial wasteland that has been there for 10 years was, in fact, a very thriving area of economic activity previously. Therefore, the risks to which the honourable member refers undoubtedly were present previously. I'm not sure whether or not any emergencies occurred as a result of flooding or natural events there.

I am sure that our architects, engineers and other personnel will work exceptionally closely with SES or any other personnel that can offer good, expert advice to ensure that any risk, not only to our emergency services personnel, but anybody using the precinct will be minimised, with the very best possible designs and the collaboration with the experts that help us in government and in building these facilities. We want public safety. I believe that might be something all of us can be agreed on, whether we support the stadium or not, that if the stadium does go ahead, that all the surrounds and all the facilities be as safe as possible for all. In particular, we want to ensure that our emergency service personnel are not put in unnecessary harm's way.

Supplementary Question.

Ms BURNET - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms BURNET - The minister touched on the SES report. I suppose it shows that there was very little information. How is it likely that the Tasmanian Planning Commission can actually draw from the information if there's not enough information in the first place?

The SPEAKER - It's a further question than what you asked in the original. I don't know if the honourable Treasurer has anything more to add.

Mr ABETZ - Speaker, I don't think I have anything further to add. The question is largely hypothetical. You're asking whether or not the TPC can deal with that particular matter. When we open the volume or volumes in six days' time, I'm sure we'll find out whether or not they have dealt with that particular matter.


St Patrick's Catholic School Childcare Centre Closure

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.06 a.m.]
Recently I met Kate, a working mum with two kids and one of a dozen families in the Latrobe area having to seek alternative care for their children once the childcare centre at St Patrick's Catholic School closes on Christmas Eve. There are more than 50 children enrolled at the centre with another 150 children on the wait list. Parents have told me that they will have to resign from their jobs if they can't get the care for their children that they deserve.

The CEO of the nearby Devonport Childcare Centre says that she's been inundated with requests from St Patrick's families, but they already have 300 on their wait list. What is your government doing to assist Kate and the many families in your own electorate impacted by the closure of St Patrick's childcare centre? And when your budget is such a mess, with only promises of cuts to come, where are you going to find money to respond to the crisis in early education and care impacting so many Tasmanian families?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I'm well aware of the circumstances of childcare in Latrobe. I first became aware of this matter when Mayor Peter Freshney contacted me. I know our Minister for Education then spoke to the mayor and other people of course, and has spoken to the local member, Mr Ellis, as well, who has intimate knowledge of the circumstance.

On the 26th of August, the Minister of Education was advised by Catholic Education Tasmania (CET) of its intention to close the St Patrick's childcare centre in Latrobe on 24 December this year. Like the minister, I acknowledge this announcement from CET will have a significant impact on the community, particularly for families with children enrolled or soon to be enrolled at the centre, and, of course, the dedicated staff. You have mentioned Kate, and I empathise again with Kate but also the affected families.

I understand that while childcare is largely a federal government responsibility, I understand that the Minister for Education has been actively engaged with CET and the Latrobe council, as I've previously stated since the announcement, to understand whether there are any alternative options available or actions that could be taken to provide greater certainty for families.

These conversations are ongoing. We recognise that despite this being a federal government responsibility, we as the state government are closer to the community and therefore better understand the impact. We will work hard to find alternative options for families, as is our job as local members and for the Minister for Education as well. These conversations are ongoing and I know that the Minister for Education will look forward to updating the community at a later time.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, honourable Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will take the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - My question to the Premier is: state government can take a more active role - capital properties, you can wash your hands and say it is a federal government responsibility - what is your government going to do to help these families?

Mr ROCKLIFF - I understand. I believe what I have said already, and I certainly wouldn't characterise our response by any stretch of the imagination as you have characterised it, because we've been very active since we've been alerted to these challenges by parents and families, and the Mayor of Latrobe, Peter Freshney, who is an outstanding mayor and citizen of the north-west coast.

We will work hard to resolves these matters. I look forward to conversations continuing in the community, with Catholic Education Tasmania and other childcare providers. No doubt people will have ideas and options for how we can support ongoing care for children and their families.


UTAS Stadium Hawthorn Football Club Agreement

Prof RAZAY question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[11.11 a.m.]
We had the most successful football program in the north through arrangement with the Hawthorn Football Club. That's manifested with the highest attendance of fans in UTAS Stadium. It has brought nearly $30 million yearly economic benefit in the north. Businesses are very concerned that building the Macquarie Point stadium in the south might compromise that economic benefit. What assurance would you give to the people of the north that this economic benefit would not be compromised, and whether we should continue with the arrangement with the Hawthorn Football Club in the future?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank Prof Razay for the question. When you were starting to ask questions about football, I had visions of Bob Gordon, who continually tells me that 'football' is in fact the correct name for what I would refer to as 'soccer'. I understand your question is about Australian Rules Football and will respond accordingly.

It would be fair to say that the Hawthorn Football Club arrangement has been a successful one for Tasmania, and particularly for northern Tasmania. The increased capacity that is being developed at the York Park UTAS Stadium these days is something that I trust and believe the people of northern Tasmania will appreciate, and indeed all the people of Tasmania who travel to watch football or Australian rules being played there.

In relation to that which is occurring at Hobart with the new stadium, the simple fact is that with all the best will in the world, those that know the AFL world the best tell us that you can't redevelop York Park or Bellerive to the standard required for a successful AFL club. I can assure you that if people were of a view that it could be, the AFL wouldn't be spending as much money on a new stadium, federal Labor wouldn't be convinced of spending money and nor would we. The simple fact is if we want a team, we need a new stadium. A Tasmanian taskforce in 2019 came to the conclusion, after considerable deliberation, that to have a successful AFL team in Tasmania we needed a new stadium located in the CBD and with a roof. That was presented to the AFL and the AFL, in general terms, accepted that that is what is needed.

The Tasmanian AFL taskforce six years ago informed itself as to all the requirements that were needed for a successful football team. Yes, you can play at York Park and if you fly in and fly out, it is like when you do business interstate; you can do that from a hotel room, but you don't call it home and it's not home. That is the difference with the fly in, fly out in Launceston. We need a proper home, not a hotel room.

The SPEAKER - The honourable minister's time has expired.


Recommendations of Independent Education Inquiry

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.15 a.m.]
Your Education minister's determination to push through her multi-school organisation pet project is going down like a lead balloon with educators and school communities. Your government came to office promising to improve Tasmania's education outcomes. After 11 years of Liberal government, our year 12 attainment and completion rates are the lowest in the nation and NAPLAN and school attendance rates are below the national average. Tasmanian teachers and educators are confused, angry and frustrated that their minister is not listening to them. They've seen structural groupings of schools all before, like clusters, districts, networks, and collectives.

Premier, your minister hasn't done the work to build support and is ignoring the recommendations of the independent education inquiry which says that for any reforms to be implementable they need to have sustained multi-partisan support. Why does your minister think she knows better than her workforce educators - 

The SPEAKER - The honourable member's time for asking the question has expired.

Mr WILLIE - and isn't this attitude likely to end in disruption, wasted resources, and no improvement in student outcomes?

The SPEAKER - The Premier does not have to provide an answer to the last 10 seconds of that question.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. Quite clearly, our government values education and has been very consistent in investing in education and our schools over the course of the last decade. We're very much committed to the principles founded, particularly in Gonski and Gonski 2.0, when it comes to fair funding for our schools and ensuring that the resourcing of our schools goes where it's most needed, the areas of disadvantage around our state, so we're investing the resources where they would be most valued around our community, as per the Gonski principles.

We're also making education to years 11 and 12 more accessible by extending our high school subject offerings to every high school around Tasmania, which has supported thousands of students completing year 12. The value we place on education is also law now, with the review of the Education Act 1994 and the new Education Act 2016, where we made it law to ensure that our young people finish their education either at year 12 or when they turned 18, or engage in vocational education and training.

The multi-schools program is an extension of our reforms to ensure that we can support schools to work together in the best interests of all the students, which is part of our ongoing reform. We're also strengthening literacy and numeracy teaching in our Tasmanian schools, including the year 1 phonics check. We're extending the amount of time students spend learning reading, writing and mathematics, with all schools required to teach one hour of literacy a day and one hour of numeracy.

We have implemented evidence-based phonics literacy instruction and by 2026 all Tasmanian students will be taught to read this way. We know this is working, with a number of students meeting or exceeding expected phonics achievements increasing by 5 per cent. We have delivered more than 800 decodable readers to every prep classroom for term 1 2025, and we continue to drive a range of initiatives to deliver literacy and numeracy outcomes in our schools for our students.

We've also signed the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement - 

The SPEAKER - The honourable Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Premier, why does your minister think she knows better than her workforce educators and isn't this attitude likely to lead to disruption, wasted resources and no improvement in student outcomes?

The SPEAKER - The disruption wasn't part of your original question.

Mr Willie - It's supplementary.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I don't agree with you. Our minister is very passionate about her role and travels right around this state visiting education settings and many schools and engaging with principals and teachers and they appreciate that engagement. Our minister learns every single time she walks through a school gate as to the needs of teachers, staff, support staff and others, and has worked to deliver a very good deal for Tasmania in the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement with the Commonwealth, where Tasmanian public schools will be funded at 100 per cent of the schooling resource standard by 2026, delivering an estimated additional $447 million to Tasmanian public schools over the life of the agreement. That's due to the very good and constructive work between the honourable member, Ms Palmer, and Jason Clare, the federal Education minister.

Greyhound Racing Ban

Mr Di FALCO question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.21 a.m.]
Your decision to ban greyhound racing in Tasmania has left thousands of participants, volunteers and regional communities devastated. This industry supports jobs, tourism and regional economies, while also having undertaken significant reforms to improve animal welfare. These owners and trainers deeply care about their greyhounds and animal welfare. How do you justify punishing an entire community and industry with a blanket ban rather than working with stakeholders on further reforms that balance welfare with livelihoods?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question and I know of his considerable interest in this matter. As members are aware, our government announced we would phase out greyhound racing in Tasmania by 30 June 2029. This coincides with the expiring of the current funding deed, providing an opportunity to deliver a measured transition that focuses on the welfare of greyhounds and, of course, the participants. I acknowledge within your question the deep disappointment of participants in the greyhound racing industry around our government's decision.

As I said, the time has come to make a call on the future of greyhound racing in Tasmania. I have set out my beliefs about the future of the industry and continue to be concerned about animal welfare and the social licence. My view is the time has come to draw a line in the sand and ensure an orderly exit from greyhound racing in Tasmania. 

The Racing minister, Ms Howlett, and I have requested that the Independent Racing Integrity Commissioner, Sean Carroll, develop a comprehensive plan to deliver all operational animal welfare and integrity components of the transition. A Joint Parliamentary Committee will be established to provide parliamentary scrutiny and public accountability for the work being undertaken by the commissioner. It is an important process for the industry to engage with the parliamentary committee and express their views on the transition. The welfare of greyhounds is very important and it has to be done in a measured and considered way. There are well over 700 greyhounds that need to be supported, housed and the like over the course of the next number of years until we end greyhound racing. Therefore, the industry engagement is going to be extremely important. 

Your advocacy in that space will also be very important, Mr Di Falco, to ensure that the concerns of participants are well catered for, so we can support participants as well. I acknowledge the difficulty this has placed on a number of participants. We need to be very measured in this. I know there's a lot of passions within the community - 

The SPEAKER - The honourable Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Macquarie Point Stadium - Federal Funding and Housing Plan 

[11.25 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Treasurer) - Honourable Speaker, I have three further bits of information in relation to Prof Razay's question. A minimum of four games will be locked in for the Tassie Devils at the UTAS Stadium. Bass will be a beneficiary as well of the $360 million AFL investment that will be right around the state. 

In response to the member for Clark, Ms Burnet, I have a letter in front of me which is on the MPDC website from the State Emergency Service. Paragraph 2 reads:

SES notes the additional and ongoing comprehensive stormwater modelling and work being undertaken by the project team since the 8 May report addresses the areas previously raised by SES.

In relation to Mr Bayley and the housing aspect, the schedule of the federation funding agreement set out requirements for the Tasmanian government, including housing as part of the development of Macquarie Point. The precinct master plan, including a housing plan, is expected to be provided to the Australian Government before the end of the year. A draft was discussed at officer level during the caretaker period and feedback is being incorporated into the final plan. 

In relation to the 30 June date mentioned, this was an expected completion date and was delayed by caretaker government. MPDC provided the draft at officials level and are working through feedback to make sure it addresses additional matters of interest.

I can confirm that the Prime Minister did make the comments that he did in relation to the $240 million being for the precinct and not specifically for the stadium. 


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Greyhound Racing Ban

Ms BUTLER question to MINISTER for RACING, Ms HOWLETT

[11.27 a.m.]
A constituent has asked why you, of all people, with a family involvement in the greyhound industry spanning decades, has dealt the final death knell for the Tasmanian greyhound racing industry. Was your agreement to ban greyhound racing, a political agreement to secure crossbench support for your Liberal-Greens government. Will you stand up for the greyhound community? What's more important: greyhound families or you keeping your job?


Ambulance Wait Times

Ms ROSOL question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mrs ARCHER

My question is on behalf of a Bass constituent, Peter. Last week, an elderly man fell in Kings Meadows and an ambulance was called. However, Peter and others had to care for the man as best they could for over an hour before the ambulance arrived. Peter was deeply concerned that community members were left to provide care for so long when medical treatment was required, meaning the man was missing out on the care he needed.

Peter asks why this is allowed to happen in Tasmania. Why are the stadium and other non-urgent infrastructure projects being prioritised over ensuring we have enough emergency services to meet community need? And what are you doing to fix this problem so Tasmania has enough ambulances to meet the emergency care needs of all Tasmanians at the time they need it?


Smithton Child and Family Learning Centre - Planning

Mr JAENSCH question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, CHILDREN and YOUTH, Ms PALMER

My question is for the Minister for Education, Children and Youth, on behalf of constituents of mine in Circular Head following commitments made to that community during the recent election. Can the minister please confirm when a local enabling group will be established to commence planning for the Smithton Child and Family Learning Centre?


Treasurer's Comments in Question Time - 11 September 2025

Mr MITCHELL question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

I have a question from Mary of Dunalley, who was listening in to the broadcast earlier. The Treasurer's reference to people as 'hapless' who listened to Question Time in parliament. I have here a definition of 'hapless':

Synonyms - miserable; misfortunate; pathetic; piteous; pitiable; pitiful; poor, wretched; unfortunate; not favoured by fortune; marked or accompanied by, or resulting in ill fortune. 

Mr MITCHELL - Which of these does the Treasurer think describes Tasmanians who listen in to Parliament?

Mr Abetz - Unfortunate. Get a sense of humour.


Caretaker Conventions - Marinus Agreement Termination Clause

Mr GARLAND question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

My question is from Joan from Natone. The guidelines on the caretaker conventions and the operations of government during caretaker period specify that if it is not possible to defer a major contract or agreement until after the caretaker period for legal, commercial or other reasons, then the minister, after agreement with the Premier, should consult the relevant opposition spokesperson regarding the commitment. Agencies should also ensure new contracts entered into during the caretaker period include clauses providing for termination in the event of an incoming government not wishing to proceed.

Minister, at the time that you signed the Marinus agreement, the election votes were still being counted and it was not clear which party would form government. Therefore, could you please state whether the Marinus agreement contains a termination clause as specified in the guidelines on caretaker conventions?


Power Line Installation - Policies and Compliance

Mr Di FALCO question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

My question is on behalf of a concerned constituent regarding the installation of distribution and transmission lines along main streets and local roads. Many of these lines appear to have been placed too close to homes that pre-date the power infrastructure. My constituent would like to understand the legal minimum distance requirements for easement widths that power lines on main streets and roads must maintain from existing residential buildings, especially in cases where those houses were established prior to the installation of the power infrastructure.

Minister, are there any policies or programs such as formal reviews, adjustments or relocation schemes, for properties where lines are found to be installed within potentially unsafe and non-compliant distances from homes?


Northern Recreational Hub - New Basketball Courts

Mr FERGUSON question to MINISTER for SPORT, Mr DUIGAN

My constituents in Bass have received news of a further four indoor courts to be added to the Northern Recreational Hub under development in Mowbray with great excitement. Can the minister please provide an update to my constituents on what progress has already been achieved on site, how the government contract is enabling the additional courts and how that development will benefit participants across other sporting codes, including basketball, to enable additional court time?

The SPEAKER - Are there any other independent member questions?

Mr Di FALCO - Honourable Speaker?

The SPEAKER - Sorry, you only get one each. Good try.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Sorry, the Clerks have advised that because there are three set aside for the Independents, Mr Di Falco, you are allowed to ask another Independent question.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - You've raised the standard very well.


Transfer duty concession

Mr Di FALCO question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

The 50 per cent property transfer duty concession for eligible pensioners who were downsizing to a new home in Tasmania expired on 30 June 2025. This concession provided a 50 per cent reduction in transfer duty to pensioners who sold their former homes and purchased a smaller one up to the value of $600,000. It was a welcome relief and an incentive to downsize, especially in a time of housing shortages and rising living costs. As of now, there is no indication that the 50 per cent concession has been extended past 30 June 2025. Will this concession be reestablished to assist pensioners in downsizing?

Time expired.

STATEMENT BY SPEAKER

Mr Garland - Resignation from JSC on Integrity

[11.37 a.m.]
The SPEAKER - I've received the following communication from the honourable member for Braddon, Mr Garland, dated 9 September 2025:

The Honourable Jacquie Petrusma MP
Speaker of the House of Assembly
Parliament House
Hobart TAS 7000

Dear Honourable Speaker,

Re: The Joint Standing Committee on Integrity

In accordance with Section 25 of the Integrity Commission Act 2009, I hereby notify you of my resignation from the Joint Standing Committee on Integrity.

Yours sincerely
Craig Garland MP
Member for Braddon


MOTION

Committee Appointments

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of Government Business) (by leave) - Honourable Speaker, I have a number of motions this morning and the first one dealing with a matter that you've just raised. I move - 

That the honourable member for Clark, Mr Vermey, be appointed to serve on the Joint Standing Committee on Integrity in accordance with section 23(4) of the Integrity Commission Act 2009 (No. 67 of 2009).

The honourable member for Clark, Ms Burnet, be appointed to the Standing Committee on Government Administration A in the place of the honourable member for Braddon, Mr Garland.

Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the House. I just want to comment on the motion moved by the Leader of Government Business. The opposition wasn't aware that Mr Garland had resigned from the Joint Committee on Integrity. I do just note that by appointing a second government member, the committee will now have two Lower House members of the Liberal Party and just one Lower House member of the Labor Party. I wonder what thought was given to replacing Mr Garland with another Independent member of this House, or a Greens member of this House, or a second member of the opposition, or at least consulting with the other parties in this House around the membership of that committee. I do note now that there will be two members of the government and just one member of the opposition.

Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, on behalf of the Greens, I don't believe we were aware of this. This is an unfortunate misstep after all the good work that was done and the hard work that was done. It might be unintentional, and I'm sure it is.

It's a very important committee. It's possibly the most important committee of this House. We can't be blindsided by emotion. I'm not wanting to cast aspersions, but we are blindsided. Whether that's intentional, I assume it's unintentional. The makeup of that committee is absolutely critical. We want to understand how this affects the representation of the government and non-government members on that committee.

If it changes the proportion of current sitting government members on that committee, then we would seek either for it to be withdrawn so there can be conversations across the bench - I don't want us to be in a position where we'd have to take a vote. We've been working in good faith on these matters. I don't believe it's intentional. It's such an important committee. The Greens would have to - without understanding the proportion, we don't have anything in front of us. We'd have to vote against the motion. We don't want to do that. If there's a way it can be withdrawn, we can talk about it and then understand it and bring it back. We would be happier with that.

Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, this is not a reflection on Mr Vermey at all, but it is more of the make-up of our committee. The point is well-raised by the Leader of Opposition Business and the Leader of the Greens. There're a lot of committees flying around. Let's be gracious, this may have been missed. I think it is important that an appropriate conversation is had. If there is an ability to deal with it in another, more reasonable way, to bring back to the House, I think that would be appropriate.

[11.42 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of Government Business) - Honourable Speaker, can I indicate that yes, I will withdraw the motion for the benefit of further discussions taking place. As I understand it, the government is entitled to two members on the committee, given that we have three ministers in the other place and no backbenchers up there. That is why Mr Vermey was appointed. I understand it is open to the Greens to nominate Ms O'Connor from the Upper House onto this committee as well, and that way we can get the numbers.

Look, having said that, there was a lot of goodwill expressed on Tuesday in relation to the committees. A lot of praise was quite rightly given to a particular staff member who had put all this together. He has worked assiduously to ensure that the harmony that we had on Tuesday continues to break out. As a result, I will withdraw only the first part of the motion, because I understand, Ms Burnet, you're happy to serve on the Administration A Committee. 

Ms Burnet - Yes, if you can split it up. 

The SPEAKER - Treasurer, the advice is that you need to first seek leave to withdraw the whole motion and then you can move the second part of that motion as you outlined. 

Mr ABETZ - All right, thank you for that guidance, Speaker. 

I seek leave to withdraw the motion.

[11.44 a.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I'm not trying to play funny buggers, I just wanted to reiterate that also there was no shade on Mr Vermey in the comments I made earlier; it was simply about the composition of the committee. I take on notice what the leader of the house said regarding the entitlement to a number of members of the government. 

What I would say when it comes to the composition of that committee is that even if we as a Chamber expressed a wish for a particular upper House member, Ms O'Connor or any other, to be appointed to a particular joint House committee, that's not a decision for us. As my upper House colleagues remind me very often, it's a matter for that Chamber to decide who they appoint to joint committees. If we wanted one of our members, we could nominate them, of course - not for this in particular but for any committee - but ultimately that will be a vote for that Chamber to decide who serves on joint committees.

I acknowledge that you don't have backbenchers in the upper House, but that's really not a concern for this House in deciding on the members that we appoint to a joint committee and it does affect the numbers in terms of government and non-government representation. As the member for Franklin said, it is a very vital committee of this parliament that conducts very important work, not that any committee doesn't conduct important work, but the Integrity Committee is one that Tasmanians really rely on. 

Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, if I may quickly reiterate some of those points, just to comment that this is not a reflection on Mr Vermey's capacity to perform a good role on that committee. Likewise, Mr Street and other staff would have helped negotiate through all of these committee processes. As a matter of principle, the simple fact that we don't have even a written copy of the motion in front of us is reason enough to question our ability to have this conversation here and now. 

I am absolutely sure this can and will be worked through satisfactorily, but I reiterate that while the Greens are eligible for a position on that committee, there is no guarantee that Ms O'Connor will be selected for that. We would want to have a conversation with her as to how those conversations in the other place are going and reserve our right to nominate someone from this House to that committee. On that basis, we absolutely accept and thank the leader for withdrawing this motion and we obviously support that. 

Leave granted.

Motion withdrawn. 


MOTION

Committee Appointment - Ms Burnet - Government Administration A

[11.47 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ - Honourable Speaker, I thank the House and will try again with the second part of the motion. I move - 

That the honourable member for Clark, Ms Burnet, be appointed to the Standing Committee on Government Administration A in the place of the honourable member for Braddon, Mr Garland. 

Motion agreed to. 


SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS

Debate Motion Forthwith

[11.47 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of Government Business) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent a motion concerning committees from being debated forthwith. 

That relates to greyhounds, domestic violence, and that shameless power grab by the Greens for the Parliamentary Library.

Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, my goodness, I am really sad that the leader of the house missed my very lengthy contribution on the value of the Library Committee on Tuesday. I am going to address these three committees in reverse order. I might have sounded sarcastic, but I know the Library Committee doesn't meet regularly. 

The SPEAKER - This is on the motion that the Standing Orders be suspended. Do you have another motion to speak to? 

Ms HADDAD - No. 

Motion agreed to.

The Speaker;
The Chair of Committees;
Ms Brown;
Mr Fairs;
Prof. Razay
Mr Shelton.

[11.48 a.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I'm new to this role, I will one day work out which vote we're on at which time.

I will address these three committees in reverse order. I know the Library Committee is not one that meets regularly, but it is nonetheless one that is important for us to retain as a parliament for many reasons. One, not least of which, is recognising the enormous body of work that the library staff do on behalf of all of us - all the library staff. In particular, the Research Service does a lot of work for Independent, opposition and crossbench members of this parliament that we rely on very heavily. I am confident that those members of this Chamber will contribute where required to the Library Committee.

The Joint Standing Committee on Family, Domestic and Sexual Violence is one that the opposition welcomes. My colleague, the shadow minister for the prevention of family and sexual violence, Ms Brown, will be our nominee for that committee. I know from working now for some time with Ms Brown that this is a particularly important area for her, as I know it is for you as well, honourable Speaker. I think it is very pertinent that the parliament establishes an ongoing sessional committee to deal with the scourge of family and sexual violence. It is a scourge on our society. It affects so many Tasmanians and it is the responsibility of all of us as parliamentarians to do everything that we can within our power as community leaders to reduce and prevent the incidents of family and sexual violence. Having a standing committee that will be able to apply a lens of family and sexual violence to bills that come before this parliament and to policy issues that are referred to it by either Chamber of this parliament is going to be very important. It is indeed a responsibility of all of us as parliamentarians to do what we can to make sure that that occurs.

Our family violence laws were really groundbreaking and nation-leading when they were adopted back in 2004. In saying that, I want to recognise the work of former attorney-general Judy Jackson, who introduced those laws, not without significant pushback. It was a massive task for Judy Jackson to achieve that legislation as attorney-general. I joined her staff about a year after those laws were enacted, and daily we were still receiving in her office some pretty significant pushback from community members around the introduction of family violence laws. I think that was because people didn't want to acknowledge that it's real and it's a very serious thing that happens in our society, and there is a responsibility for government to legislate. That said, in those intervening 20-odd years, our understanding of the complexity of family violence has continued to grow and evolve. The understanding of coercive control, non-physical forms of family violence - although they are actually included in our legislation, that part of our legislation could definitely be strengthened. As I said, as our understanding of the complexity of sexual and family violence continues to evolve and grow, it is important that our laws evolve and grow as well. I hope that's something that this new committee will be able to look to. I know that my colleague, shadow minister Meg Brown, will make a contribution on the importance of that committee as well.

Lastly, this motion establishes a joint standing committee on the greyhound racing industry in Tasmania. This is one of the first very tangible examples that we have of the deals that Jeremy Rockliff did to retain power in this place, the backroom deals that he did - without consultation, without talking to the community, without talking to anybody affected - in order to cling on to power. Whatever anyone in this place thinks individually of the greyhound racing industry, it cannot be characterised as a genuine policy shift from this government. It has to be seen in the context that it was, which is a backroom deal to hold on to power. 

Just weeks before this policy shift was made by Jeremy Rockliff to hold onto power, a letter was sent to the industry showing that this Liberal Party had full support for the industry. No matter what you think about the industry, to have a letter that says, 'We back you in', and then a deal for power is done behind closed doors in a windowless room in this building, with a complete 180-degree change in that position, whether you like the change or not, you can't trust the word of this premier. If anyone in any industry has a letter from Jeremy Rockliff saying, 'We back you', well, you might as well throw it in the bin today because it's not worth the price of the paper that it's written on.

My colleague, the shadow treasurer, will make comments about the establishment of this committee, but there has been so much misinformation in the weeks since the election. When the Liberal Party makes a change, it's welcomed by others as a policy concession. However, if the Labor Party ever changes position on anything - and we have done, it's seen as a terrible backflip.

Mr Abetz - No, we supported you on the stadium.

Ms HADDAD - That is how it has been characterised, perhaps not by you, honourable Leader of the House, but by others: a terrible backflip and no-one knows where we stand on anything. However, when the Liberal Party writes letter after letter to industry saying, 'We back you', and then next minute, 'You're gone', that's not a backflip from the Liberal Party; that's a welcomed policy change.

I understand this is a minority parliament. Had we formed government, we would have known we were governing in a minority. However, these were deals done by Jeremy Rockliff to hold on to power. Whether you support the deal or you don't, name it up: 'Yes, we wanted to stay in government. Yes, we wanted to keep our ministerial positions. So, we did deals to keep those positions, we did deals to stay in government.' People would respect you more if you characterised it that way and were honest with the Tasmanian people that these are the backroom deals you did to stay in government.

[11.56 a.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I will make some brief comments on the establishment of the joint standing committee on family, domestic and sexual violence. Our shadow for family violence, Tabatha Badger, the member for Lyons, will also make a few comments.

This is a historic moment. Many women in this party - people in this party, we all support the establishment of this committee. I commend Ms Badger for her work in pushing to have this committee established. I am proud of the work she has done, not only in her portfolio, standing up on family violence, but to have done the work across the parliament, for this joint standing committee to be established. It will be an opportunity to provide the scrutiny that is needed on the policies of the government of the day, on the budget of the government of the day, to hear the stories directly from people who are working on the front line and victim/survivors, to find out and make sure we can do everything we can. I look forward to the work of that committee and to making the changes we need so that we can put an end to family violence in Tasmania.

I am so pleased to see that the joint standing committee on greyhound racing in Tasmania is finally being established with the terms of reference we have before us. The Greens have been speaking publicly for at least one-and-a-half decades about the cruelty and suffering our beautiful greyhounds experience that is an unavoidable and inevitable part of the greyhound racing industry. It has been our policy for over 10 years to ban a greyhound racing because of the injury and because everything about it shows there is no way to prevent that cruelty. 

We saw from the evidence in Saul Eslake's recent report that the funding from taxpayers to prop up the greyhound racing industry has been steadily increasing in Tasmania over the last 15 years. At the same time, the participation of people attending the gambling sport of greyhound racing has been declining, and the economic benefits have been going down. Tasmanians are propping up an industry that, at its heart, cannot avoid cruelty and suffering - the deaths, the broken bones and all the other damage that occurs to greyhounds. 

The phasing out the greyhound racing industry, which is what this committee will be working on, is backed by 74 per cent of Tasmanians. My message to anyone who puts their hand up to be on the committee is that this is not a committee to debate the phase-out of greyhound racing in Tasmania. That decision has been made. This is a committee to phase out the greyhound racing industry, to protect the welfare of greyhounds and participants in the industry during the phase-out period, have transitional arrangements for participants and fair and reasonable compensation requirements. 

It's a committee to make sure that greyhounds are rehomed and to make sure that breeding doesn't continue. It's a committee to make sure that beautiful dogs who have given their life in the industry can live in a home and be cared for, not be euthanised, exported to the mainland or dumped inappropriately because of the phase-out.

It's a very important committee, so we must have committee members who are signed up to the terms of reference. If there is any party or any member not prepared to do that, then just cede your position to somebody else who is. There are plenty of people in this parliament with goodwill who will work towards the terms of reference on this committee. It would be disingenuous if any member of a party who is committed to overturning this ban put their hand up and did not want to act in good faith on this committee. We expect that members of parliament will only want to be involved in this if they want to be involved in good faith. 

There will be many conversations about what fair compensation looks like, what rehoming requires and all the other matters over the next four years. I need to follow on from some comments made in the Chamber yesterday. There is four years ahead of us in the phase-out of greyhound racing. We know that a cashed-up mainland sporting group, with the backing of big gambling interests, has come down to Tasmania with a view to oppose the ban on greyhound racing. That is concerning because of the public statements that were made, because it was headed by Luke Gatehouse, who was the president of the Brisbane Greyhound Racing Club for over 17 years. The Brisbane Greyhound Racing Club is one of the most notorious in terms of the animal suffering and cruelty, and the deaths that have occurred.

We know is that during the lunch break yesterday, at 1.25pm, the honourable member for Franklin, Dean Winter, uploaded a video clip of the Minister for Racing, Jane Howlett, onto the Save Greyhound Racing in Tasmania Facebook group's page. It was a clip presented in a frame designed to bait members, and it worked -

Mr Winter - Those were her exact words.

The SPEAKER - The honourable member for Franklin can have his opportunity to respond in the appropriate way.

Dr WOODRUFF - Comments from the Facebook members on Mr Winter's post included vile, misogynistic and hateful abuse directed towards the honourable minister, as well as veiled threats to herself and the Premier. Other Labor members are also included in that Facebook group, including the honourable member for Bass, Ms Finlay. For a member of the parliament to initiate, and allow to continue by omission, the endorsement of a social media pile-on that was misogynistic and abusive is utterly at odds with our Standing Orders' code of practice, the ethical code - 

Dr BROAD - Point of order. If the member is going to make an allegation, she should do it in the substantial way. 

Mr Bayley - Which point of order?

Dr Broad - It's Standing Order 2. She's making an accusation. There are forms of the House to make an accusation and she should use the appropriate forms instead of in this manner.

The SPEAKER - The honourable members can have the right of reply and you can respond to the debating points Dr Woodruff is raising.

Dr WOODRUFF - Thank you, honourable Speaker. I'm treating this seriously because yesterday in the House, the honourable member said:

I did not incite and would never incite anyone in the way that the minister inferred that I did.

But we know that this member - and I don't know if the honourable member has taken down his post from that Facebook page - 

Dr Broad - Why should he?

Dr WOODRUFF - If he hasn't, he is involved in inciting misogynistic comments towards a member of this House.

The SPEAKER - Honourable member for Braddon, you have the right of reply.

Dr WOODRUFF - It's a very important point that we make a stand about the tone and the words people in this place use.

Dr Broad - Check your own Facebook posts.

Dr WOODRUFF - We do need to. When we are told that anything that we've done on our Facebook page has received vile and misogynistic comments, we should take them down.

Dr Broad - On somebody else's page?

Dr WOODRUFF - Yes, but -

Dr Broad - We're responsible for somebody else's?

The SPEAKER - Order, the member for Braddon. Dr Broad, you can have an opportunity to respond. I ask that the honourable Leader of the Greens is heard in silence, please.

Dr WOODRUFF - We know that the member has been involved in stoking these fires, basically, for a number of weeks, because he put a post to that group three weeks ago -

Mr WINTER - Point of order, honourable Speaker. There are forms of the House for the member to make allegations like this. It's not in a debate about the establishment of committees. If the member has allegations to make, she should make them in the correct form of the House. This is completely irrelevant to the motion.

The SPEAKER - The honourable member for Franklin does bring up the point of Standing Order 45, relevance. I ask the Leader of the Greens, do you intend on -

Dr WOODRUFF - I will make myself clear. The reason I've raised it in this form is because we're establishing a committee. This committee is about the phase-out of greyhound racing. That is a decision that's been made. There is a mainland group that's come down to Tasmania that is trying to do everything they can to overturn that ban. That is the right of a group to do that. However, we have a member of this House who has posted a clip of the Minister for Racing onto that page and a whole range of vile, misogynistic and abusive comments that have been made as a result of that -

Ms Brown - It has nothing to do with the motion here, and she's characterising our shadow treasurer.

The SPEAKER - Honourable member for Franklin, you will resume your seat. The Leader of the Greens has stated that she has made it relevant back to the committee by stating that it's about a safe place. You can have your right of reply after the honourable member is finished.

Dr WOODRUFF - My point is there are four years to go for this committee. A member of parliament should do everything possible to dissociate themselves -

Ms Finlay - How do you dissociate from your people?

Dr WOODRUFF - from vile and misogynistic comments.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition, you can make you contribution soon.

Dr WOODRUFF - There is a real risk of harm that can come from these sorts of things. We've already seen animal activists in Tasmania -

Members interjecting

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable Leader of the Greens has the call. Each one of you can make a contribution to this motion. I ask that the honourable member be heard in silence. I do ask the honourable member to be relevant to the formation of committees.

Dr WOODRUFF - Animal welfare activists for years have been attacked by people in this industry when they have tried to raise the cruelty and suffering in this industry. It is because of the evidence they have brought of the cruelty and suffering that public sentiment has tipped over and three-quarters of Tasmanians are backing the end of greyhound racing. We're in this phase now. We know that social media pile-ons can be dangerous. There is a real risk of harm. 
We know that people have been assaulted and murdered for standing up on unpopular things. I call on every member of this House to make sure that we do the best we can to disengage ourselves from social media posts that have got to this dangerous place. I call on the member for Franklin, Mr Winter, to take down his post that is generating those sorts of comments from that public page. The Greens will work in good faith on that committee to end greyhound racing. 

I thank all the community groups that for many years have been doing the hard work of protecting greyhounds from the cruelty that had been occurring in the racing industry: Animal Liberation Tasmania, Let Greyhounds Run Free, the Dogs' Homes of Tasmania, the Coalition for the Protection of Greyhounds, Brightside Farm Sanctuary, the RSPCA (all checked) and all the good-hearted Tasmanians who care about the welfare of animals. We have long backed them. 

We are really grateful that there is an opportunity to work in good faith to phase out greyhound racing. I commend Ms O'Connor, the MLC for Hobart, for the work she has done over this time. She will be a very active participant of that committee.

[12.10 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise to give my contribution on this motion regarding the establishment of three very important committees. I reiterate the comments from others. I will do as the opposition business leader did and go in the reverse order.

The library committee is a very important committee in the work that it does, certainly in providing, as the member had indicated, significant support to crossbench members, in particular where we have limited staffing resources ourselves. I very much appreciate the parliamentary research team and library team as well. I am, however, somewhat relieved to say that I am not on this committee as I am on many other committees. I fully endorse this committee. 

In relation to the joint standing committee on family and domestic and sexual violence, as the honourable leader of the Greens has already done, I acknowledge and appreciate the hard work of a number of people in this particular area. In particular, the member for Lyons, who is not here at the moment, Tabatha Badger, in working with a number of other people. I also acknowledge the member for Franklin, Meg Brown, who is very keen to stay on this committee. 

It is an incredibly important move. I know there was some discussion about whether this could be done within the context of the existing Gender and Equality Committee. However, given the gravity of the matter, it deserves elevation to committee status. I am really pleased to see that this has been brought forward. Also, in relation to the joint standing committee on greyhounds, I am encouraged to see this committee come forward at a very early opportunity within this new parliament.

I want to again, as I did yesterday, state in response to the member for Clark's comments on contribution on this motion, that no deal was done. I did not ask the Premier to end greyhound racing in return for my support. What the Premier did and, indeed, I am sure what the crossbench - and I know in the meetings that we had with the Labor opposition during that period, we asked the opposition to consider policies on the basis of good evidence, on the basis of social licence and on the basis of understanding the needs and desires of the community.

The Premier read the room. You know, one could suggest that the tragic death of Raider's Guide in late July was, perhaps - I hate to use the pun - the straw that broke the greyhound's back, to indicate that a line needed to be drawn in the sand. The community has been advocating for this for decades and talking about it for decades.

Ms Haddad - Why not something else? Why not conversion practices or expungement or anything else?

Ms JOHNSTON - Honourable Speaker, I sit quietly and listen to the contributions of members. I note that other members of the opposition don't afford that opportunity to members of the crossbench.

The SPEAKER - The honourable member will be heard in silence.

Ms JOHNSTON - Thank you, honourable Speaker. So, again, there is plenty of evidence, there was plenty of strong indication of community desire. EMRS polling consistently showed 74 per cent of Tasmanians wanted to see an end to this industry. The tragic death of Raider's Guide in late July, and the Premier acted. The industry has been on its last legs for a long time, not just in Tasmania but across the globe. It was inevitable, so I commend the Premier for his actions here and reiterate this is what good evidence-based policy looks like in a power-sharing parliament.

I'd also like to acknowledge and thank, as some others may have done, Mr Street in providing opportunity for input into these terms of reference. I also acknowledge that it's the government that has brought this forward in other formal business rather than requiring another member of this place to bring it forward in their own private members' time. That is greatly appreciated and again shows the collaboration.

I would point once again to the title 'joint standing committee on greyhound racing transition', and note this is not a committee for which the policy is up for discussion. This is a committee in which we will discuss the transition arrangements, protection and welfare of greyhounds and participants in the industry, transitional arrangements, including any fair and reasonable compensation requirements, the requirements of rehoming organisations. I know that's something that we are very keen to understand and, of course, any other legislative requirements for transition. We will provide valuable support to the Racing Integrity Commissioner in the work that he is doing and undertaking at the moment.

The people who serve on this committee need to be dedicated to the transition, to making sure that there is a just and fair and reasonable transition, both for the animals involved and the participants. From experience, when dealing with a number of people in this industry, I know that those people will need to have a very strong backbone because there will be a lot of pressure coming from the industry to change this committee and the work this committee will do. 

As the honourable Leader of the Greens did in her contribution, I want to caution those who participate in the committee. I recognise that there has been a lot of passion about this topic. However, there is absolutely no place for threats to members of parliament, whether they are on this committee or not, whether they support this transition phase or not. There is no room for that. I want to put on record that I know that a number of greyhound welfare advocates, both in this place and the other Chamber, have received messages that are unacceptable. I particularly want to express publicly now my disgust at a comment on the social media post responding to a post from the honourable member for Franklin in which it references the minister and says, and I won't use the actual word, Deputy Speaker, 'What an effing joke. She needs something between the eyes.'

That is unacceptable. No-one in this place should be subjected to that. That is a threat. It's not a thinly veiled threat. I strongly urge those members of the joint standing committee on greyhound racing transition to stand strong in the face of threats like this and to stand up. I urge every member of this House to condemn that comment.

Dr Broad - They set the whole bloody thing up.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order. I ask Dr Broad, can you not point across the Chamber, please? We will hear the member in silence.

Ms JOHNSTON - I urge every member of this place to condemn those comments and to support the important work of this committee. Thank you, Deputy Speaker.

[12.17 p.m.]
Ms BROWN (Franklin) - Deputy Speaker, I will comment on a few of these committees, starting with the library committee. As a member of this committee in the past term, I'm very glad to see it re-established. I am also glad that I was reappointed by my party for that committee. Thank you very much, Treasurer.

As for the forming of the joint standing committee for family, domestic and sexual violence, there are a lot of things that we talk about in this place that transcend the political divide. This is one of them. This is something that we should all be turning our minds to every single day when it comes to new policy that we bring to this place, because of the effects that it could have on people experiencing family, domestic or sexual violence. I want to pop on the record Labor's strong commitment to protecting victim/survivors of family domestic and sexual violence. This includes, as the member said, Judy Jackson, but also more recently Michelle O'Byrne - she was a staunch advocate in this space and a mentor of mine in it. She has done so much work for the people of Tasmania when it comes to this issue.

I've said many times, inside and outside of this place, that any step forward towards equality and towards abolishing this scourge on our societies is one worth taking. I fully back the forming of this committee and I am pleased to be elected by my party to sit on it.

Lastly, I would like to talk about the greyhound committee. I want to ask: where were you lot when it was Ms Haddad getting all the shots from the community about this absolute lie about the fireplaces? Where was your support for her when she was getting the exact same posts?

Ms Ogilvie - We've all had it. We've all had threats.

Ms BROWN - Don't you dare look at me like that - when it was Ella getting those posts. You are a disgrace on that side if you don't think that she deserves the same support that you -

Ms Ogilvie - Are you going to get some more people to do a parody of me and upload that?

Ms BROWN - What was that?

Ms Finlay - Minister Ogilvie, you don't even have a backbone to stand up for yourself.

Ms BROWN - No, I didn't. Don't act like this is one-sided. Don't act like you were there for Ella, for Ms Haddad, when she was getting message after message after message.

Ms Finlay - For something that was made up.

Ms BROWN - For something that was completely untrue -

Ms Haddad - It was a complete lie from Felix Ellis. It wasn't sharing a clip of me speaking in parliament, it was a complete lie.

Ms BROWN - from Mr Ellis. Don't you dare act like this is one-sided. Thank you.

[12.21 a.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - I thank the honourable Speaker for the opportunity to say a few words on this particular motion. I commend those that have been acknowledged by the leader of the House and others for working together when it comes to the establishment of these committees.

My name has been mentioned a few times in the course of his debate, so I might make a few comments. First, on the Joint Sessional Committee on the Parliamentary Library, I commend the Parliamentary Library team for the work that they do. I say what a valuable resource that was for me in my 12 years of opposition. I think I just about wore out the carpet going from the opposition rooms into the Parliamentary Library. Juliet Webster was the person in charge of the library then. I commend all the team that are there. We welcome the establishment of this committee.

On the Joint Standing Committee on Family, Domestic and Sexual Violence, I also agree with Ms Brown, who just spoke, about the importance of this committee and the multipartisan nature that is needed with respect to this committee. I believe Ms Badger is the real driver of this committee, both in the previous parliament and this one as well. I look forward to that committee doing the work that it does. Yesterday we spoke around a matter of the importance of acknowledging migrants in our community and condemning racism. We were in furious agreement at that particular point in time, and when it comes to this committee we will be as well.

There was cause for some discussion on the Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing. The honourable Leader of Opposition Business made some comments about deals done and of that nature. I say very clearly that the policy positions that we have taken on a number of matters, including the pause on salmon study, on our forestry policy, and indeed on greyhound racing, were led by me. I initiated all those policy positions because the election on 19 July elected new members of parliament and a larger crossbench, and we listened. The people spoke and we listened in a range of areas and took note of that and those three matters were an example. We had a policy position taken following the election as a result of listening to the community. That is it. I stand by all of those positions. 

When it comes to the greyhound racing industry, as I acknowledged with Mr Di Falco's question today, there is a great deal of passion on all sides of the discussion about the banning of greyhound racing. Greyhound racing will end in 2029.

A committee has been established to look at a number of factors, including the transition and fair and reasonable compensation requirements which, in my view, is needed, given that we are ending an industry in Tasmania that will impact on a number of individuals. I accept that. Others might have a different view, but we need to support the welfare of the animals and indeed the welfare of the participants in the industry as well.

There is no excuse, however, for those passions to present in such a harmful way as has been spoken about in this Chamber today and, indeed, the online commentary against our Minister for Racing in a cruel, heartless and very threatening way is absolutely unacceptable. 

Members interjecting. 

The SPEAKER - Order. Honourable members can have their opportunity to make a comment on this after the Premier has finished. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - No-one in this place deserves to have online commentary of the nature that our Minister for Racing of the nature- 

Mr Winter - Why did you do it then? 

Ms Finlay - Not even from you against me? 

The SPEAKER - The member for Franklin and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. 

Ms Finlay - Your social media page - 

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Opposition, you have already had two warnings today. You can make your contribution soon. I ask that the Premier be heard in silence. You could then have an opportunity yourself. 

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 2 requires that people in this place are honest and they need to reflect on their own behaviours.

The SPEAKER - That's a debating point. You are welcome to make a comment soon. 

Mr Winter - They industrialised online hate. 

Ms Finlay - It requires that he is honest. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Honourable member, this is a very serious matter, particularly on this R U OK? Day. It needs to be said and it needs to be called out. I was very troubled by what happened in this place yesterday. The honourable Minister for Racing spoke out after a social media post by a member of the Opposition which incited a number of comments and led to appalling comments, including, I am very saddened to say, death threats to a minister of the Crown and a member of parliament. Death threats to anyone are utterly unacceptable.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Instead of condemning the vile comments that followed that post, others inferred that Ms Howlett should expect such appalling attacks because she's a minister of the Crown. That's an appalling interjection and utterly unacceptable, whether it's a minister of the Crown or anyone in this House or anyone in the community. 

Ms Finlay - That's right. Or by anyone, including you, Premier. 

The SPEAKER - Ms Finlay, you've had two warnings today. You are on your last one now. You can make a contribution soon. I ask that the Premier makes his contribution in silence and then one of you is welcome to get the call next.

Ms Finlay - Speaker, Standing Order 2 requires -

The SPEAKER - Thank you for your point of order. Standing Order 2 requires a substantive motion. It is not a point of order.

Ms FINLAY - I'm happy to bring one. He needs to be honest.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I believe the Leader of the Opposition also needs to be held to account because when Ms Howlett pressed the Leader of the Opposition to condemn the behaviour, he said, 'I will not be lectured by you'. The Leader of the Opposition needs to apologise on behalf of his members, condemn these posts and instruct the member for Franklin to desist from egging on such appalling behaviour.

Mr Winter - You are such a massive hypocrite.

The SPEAKER - Mr Winter, this is your second warning today. You need to listen to the honourable Premier in silence. You can make a contribution next.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The honourable member said in that Facebook group, 'Time to put pressure on Jane Howlett', referring to the honourable member for Franklin. We need to ensure that we have a respectable working environment. This sort of behaviour is unacceptable. I'm not inferring for one second the honourable member agrees with the terrible comments, an example of which was read out, but my understanding is that you can withdraw that post and those comments will go.

Dr Woodruff - Exactly. Take the video down.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That's exactly what Mr Winter needs to do and what the Leader of the Opposition needs to call on Mr Winter to do.

[12.30 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I've heard hypocrisy before, but not like that. I hope the Premier's actually going to stay here for this, because he should. I will make it as a statement of fact and see if anyone wants to disagree. No one in here has been faced with more online abuse than me. Does anyone want to argue with that? 

The SPEAKER - I do remind the member that you have to be relevant to committees as well. The other members have mentioned committees in their contribution, so you need to do likewise.

Mr WINTER - Honourable Speaker, I take full responsibility for the decisions I make and the things I say in this place. I also took full responsibility for our election campaign that we lost. I took full responsibility for not only the result but for the behaviours that I put forward. I wonder if the Premier will take full responsibility for the campaign that he ran. During the declaration of the polls, he said that he didn't like personal attacks.

Mr Rockliff - No, I don't.

Mr WINTER - Well, I'm not sure he was really watching, honourable Speaker, because the election campaign he ran was a personal attack. It was a relentless personal attack but I never complained at any point in time and I won't today either, because I take responsibility for decisions that I took, I take responsibility for the things that I say and I take responsibility for the positions that I take.

The Premier is in here today because he wants to show the Minister for Racing that he's prepared to defend her, but he's the person who put her in this position because he's the person who wrote that letter.

Dr Woodruff - It's good that he's defending her; that's what a leader should do.

Mr WINTER - He's the person who wrote the letter to Northwest Greyhound Racing Club -

Dr Woodruff - Just take the video down. Just take it down.

Mr WINTER - and told them that he supported them. He's the person who stood with them for 20 years and said he supported greyhound racing. Only weeks later, he tells the Minister for Racing, 'Actually, we're going to shut down greyhound racing. Minister, this is what we're doing.'

We don't know all the details yet, but both the Minister for Racing and the Premier had given that industry years and years and years of support. The minister stood in this place only last year and said, 'I won't be shutting greyhound racing down.' The Premier had said it himself as Minister for Racing in the years before that, 'We won't be shutting greyhound racing down,' so he's put her in this position of having an industry that thought she had their back and now she's faced with this position where it must be incredibly uncomfortable to sell out an industry in the way that this Premier has. It must be incredibly uncomfortable for a minister to have to sell out an industry that she told us she supported for all of those years.

The SPEAKER - Mr Winter, I do encourage you to make it relevant to the committees.
Mr WINTER - Honourable Speaker, I'm being as relevant as other speakers have been.

The SPEAKER - No. Every other speaker has actually drawn relevance to the make-up of the committees and making sure that the committees are a safe place.

Mr WINTER - We're talking about the committee, honourable Speaker. That's the position we're in. When it comes to this position, of course, I'm going to be respectful in the comments that I make.

My post made no commentary apart from to say, 'This is what was said today,' and I think we all should be prepared for the things that we say in this place to be put in public. The comment that was repeated a couple of times, I understand, has been deleted by the administrator of the group today, which is appropriate. The comment should not have been made, ever, at any stage. Online abuse is not okay. It is not. I believe it was minister Ogilvie who said by interjection, 'We've all had it,' and she's quite right. All of us have been subjected to online abuse and it is not okay. But is it also not okay to shut down debate? It is also not okay to change your position -

Dr Woodruff - It is when it's violent, abusive and threatening.

Mr WINTER - To shut down debate?

Dr Woodruff - Yes, absolutely.

Mr WINTER - Sorry, I'm talking about not shutting down debate. I'm not talking about the post. It is not okay to shut down debate in this place because you don't like the scrutiny that's being put on you, and the scrutiny that has been put on by the racing industry onto this Liberal government is very, very concerned about the approach that the government has taken. I absolutely do not endorse those threatening comments. I don't endorse them one bit.

Dr Woodruff - Take down the video that's inciting them.

Mr Abetz - Surely, you condemn them?

Mr WINTER - I do condemn the comment, absolutely. In fact, I already have, I believe.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr WINTER - As I said this, this industry is reeling at the moment. They thought they had a Premier and a minister that had their back and it turns out that they didn't.

We don't support the Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition, and that's why I'd like to move an amendment today to the motion - it is pretty simple, but Ms Haddad does have some copies if people need it. I move an amendment - 

Delete 'Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition' and the following two points from the motion. 

So, there are three committees this amendment deletes.

I want to put on record, now that I've moved the motion, that we do not support the establishment of this committee because we do not support the shutting down of greyhound racing in this state. We don't support it because we made commitments before the election that we will stick to. Our commitments said that we support the greyhound racing industry as we did the other codes, the same commitments that the Premier made, the same commitments that the Minister for Racing made and then backflipped on. They sold out those Tasmanians who were so aghast at the decision by the Premier to simply tear up their industry.

The establishment of this committee, I understand, allows the government to implement its policy, which is supported by most members of this House, because this is what the crossbench was asking for. The crossbench can say there's no deal, but of course it was minister Ellis during the election campaign, or just after it, who said, 'Accepting confidence is a deal, a very big deal.' It's not my definition of whether it's a deal or not. It's a definition of the government, a definition of the Premier, minister Ellis, that it's a deal. They say this is a deal with the Greens to accept confidence. The Greens have given them confidence on the basis of their moves to take up large sections of what was asked for of the salmon policy by the crossbench, and also the deal to shut down greyhound racing.

These are deals which will define this government; deals that will define this government for its entire existence. Deals that mean that people in the greyhound racing industry will watch their livelihoods start to disappear over time. Not in one fell swoop, but cruelly, over four years, as they watch the decline of their once-great industry. People who thought this Liberal government had their backs are losing their industry for good, so we don't support this. We don't support the establishment of this committee.

I will say, though, if the House does decide to instigate this committee, Labor will be seeking to take a position on it, because I will be seeking to hold this government to account for the way in which it treats greyhound racing participants throughout this. Whether it will show them some level of respect as it attempts to shut down this industry and whether we can, united as a racing community, stop this.

When I hear members talk about 'the community', I don't think the independent member for Clark in particular knows about that community, because it is a real community and they have voices and they are just as entitled to have their voice heard here as the people that you represent, independent member for Clark. I will be out tonight with people at Elwick from the greyhound racing industry. They deserve to have their voice heard here and deserve to have their voice heard on that committee. They are members who are deeply committed to animal welfare, who have retired greyhounds sleeping on the end of their bed because they love their animals. They love them from the moment they're born, from the moment they retire.

I accept, as the industry does, that there have been members of that community that haven't held up the high standards that are expected of others, and when that happens, they should be held to account for it. They haven't been, unfortunately, by this government. In fact, particularly in harness racing, but also in greyhound racing, where instances of animal abuse have not been upheld by the same government that is now promising to shut down the industry because animal welfare standards apparently weren't being upheld by them. There's the absurdity of the policy.

The motion today gives members the opportunity to outline where they stand on greyhound racing, whether they want to shut the greyhound racing industry down by supporting the establishment of this committee, or whether they're prepared to stand up with Labor and stand up for those people in regional Tasmania who deserve to have their traditional industry maintained and supported for as long as they can continue to run an industry that has a strong, united community behind it, people who love their animals and are deeply committed to animal welfare outcomes.

This will be a campaign that will be full of passion, and I would encourage every single person on both sides to conduct that campaign with respect, as I will. The comments that I will make in this place will be consistent with the comments that I will make outside of this place. They will be respectful, but they will be honest, and they will be truthful. The truth of this is that people are very angry because they've been sold out by Jeremy Rockliff and the Liberals, who sold out that industry.

Despite their anger, they need to make sure that they are respectful. Those comments, that I condemn, were not respectful and they should not have been made. As I said, I understand that particular comment that was that was referred to has been deleted and I think that's very important that it happens.

[12.41 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, it should come as no surprise that I will be opposing the amendment moved by the honourable member for Franklin. The member for Franklin's justification for moving the amendment indicated that he wants greyhound racing to continue in Tasmania and his view that by not having this committee, greyhound racing could continue. That is not the case. This committee is not a committee to end greyhound racing; that will happen regardless of where this committee exists or not.

There will be no funding for greyhound racing post 30 June 2029. The Racing Integrity Commissioner is already undertaking the necessary steps to phase out greyhound racing by 30 June 2029. He will continue to do that, regardless of whether this committee exists or not. This committee, however, is an important mechanism to ensure that racing participants, who Mr Winter, the honourable member for Franklin, is so concerned about, have an opportunity to have feedback and input into fair and reasonable transition and compensation requirements.

If he cares so greatly about the participants as he says he does, then he should support this committee, recognising this committee is not the committee that ends greyhound racing; it's the committee that supports the transition, the important work of compensation: a fair, just and reasonable transition for both the animals and the participants in the industry.

It would be absolutely absurd to not have this committee and to still have the government's policy of ending greyhound racing by 30 June 2029 continue without the appropriate support and mechanisms in place. This important committee must be allowed to continue. It's important for the animal welfare standards. We know, with grave concern, from other jurisdictions who have taken this move - and there are many other jurisdictions. I believe there are only eight left in the world where greyhound racing is acceptable. They understand that there needs to be a transition process where the welfare of animals is protected. 

We have also learnt the lesson from around the world that there needs to be a transition process in place where participants are assisted to exit the industry. Surely, if the Labor opposition want a fair outcome, when they can't change the policy position of the government, then they ought to be at the table talking about just and equitable transitions. It seems absurd to me that Labor would move to remove this committee and remove a voice for fair, equitable and just transition for this industry.

[12.44 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of Government Business) - Honourable Speaker, it won't surprise to learn that the government will be opposing this amendment. While I suspect the amendment will fail in any event, I note in the wording, the reference to two points possibly should be to clauses for clarity.

I understand the commitment and passion of the member for Franklin, Mr Winter, who said that if the committee is established, he will actively participate. I welcome that. That is good. It shows the Tasmanian community that, in the scheme of things, he believes greyhound racing is a lot more important than the issue on which he moved a motion of no confidence, namely the state of the Budget. He refuses to participate in the Multi-Partisan Budget Panel.

Members interjecting

Mr ABETZ - That is indicative of his values - that he is more concerned about greyhounds and he will passionately participate, but the very issue on which he caused an election about the Budget, he refused -

Mr Mitchell- You called the election.

Mr ABETZ - Well, ultimately, it's the Governor that calls an election in the circumstances, and the reason was that the person who tried to blow the joint up was not willing to step up.

Members interjecting

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ABETZ - We will determine who our leader is. We won't allow anybody else to determine that in this parliament. It really does reflect sadly on the opposition that they will actively participate in a greyhound committee because it is so fundamentally important, but when it comes to budget repair, nowhere to be seen.

[12.47 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, the Greens want to be involved in conversations about the welfare of greyhounds throughout the transition until the end of the industry in four years' time. We want to make sure there is appropriate rehoming. We want to make sure that the transitional arrangements for people in the greyhound racing industry are fair and compensation is reasonable. We will definitely be participating in this committee and that is why we won't support this motion.

I agree with the honourable member for Clark, Ms Johnston, that it is cutting off your nose to spite your face for the Labor Party not to want to be involved in this committee. As the Premier has made clear, this phase-out is happening regardless of whether there is a Joint Standing Committee to oversee the process or not. The joint standing committee won't stop or make any change to that. However, we need to have a say. We get to have oversight over the process. We get to call people, hear submissions and have public hearings, and all the good work that parliamentary committees can do. We will be actively involved in that process, working through the terms of reference that are being developed. We hope that members of Labor, if they put themselves up to be on the committee, would do so as well. 

To follow up a point made by Mr Winter in his comments, the only way the honourable member can show his condemnation of the comments that were made in relation to the video that he posted on the greyhound Facebook page is to remove his original post from which all those comments flow. One comment might have been removed, but there are vile, abusive and misogynistic comments against the Minister for Racing. A member of parliament should in no way be continuing to allow those sorts of comments to remain on a post he has made.

[12.57 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - In the past, Tasmania has been a nation leader in the prevention of family, domestic and sexual violence. I pay my respects to you, honourable Speaker. You've been an extraordinary part of making that happen.

Today is the next step in Tasmania leading the way in the nation. As far as we know, we are the first parliament to proactively set up a sessional committee for the prevention of family, domestic and sexual violence. That is an extraordinary achievement for everybody across the Chamber. It shows how we are not only willing to work together but to step up our efforts to fully see Tasmania be a safe place.

I thank the sector organisations and the experts who work in this space tirelessly, and for everything that they've done to help us set up this committee and provide their feedback on how it can best function to really make a difference in the lives of Tasmanians.

Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that Tasmania has the highest rates of intimate partner violence in the nation, and yet, per capita, we have some of the lowest investment into prevention. We have a lot to do. This is an incredible step in that right direction, with the long-touted review of the Family Violence Act - and we know we have to review that from 2004 to ensure that it's still fit for purpose for Tasmania today. We are assessing across the four pillars of the family violence action plan and ensuring that we are doing everything that we possibly can across those four sectors, from prevention through to supporting people and the brave victim/survivors.

I would like to echo the comments from other people across the Chamber regarding Mr Street and the incredible work he has done, not just for this committee but for all of them; that's no easy task. 

To minister Howlett, I am obviously not on the committee, but already in this space she is new to the role of Minister for Women and the Prevention of Family Violence and has already been proactively reaching out to people right across this Chamber to ensure that we can have a collaborative and apolitical approach to this. 

I would also like to thank the member for Clark, Ms Johnston, who has done an extraordinary amount of advocacy in this space, including getting this committee to the point it currently is, acknowledging it has still to go to the other place to be sorted.

This is an incredibly important day not only for Tasmania but for Australia in stamping out not only family violence but also domestic and sexual violence. I congratulate the government for recognising all three need to be addressed and that while they could be separated, they are actually all connected and our approach to preventing all three really happens when we come together. I thank them for bringing this forward because this is something they did not have to do. They could have put it forward as a Greens issue because it was something I raised in the election campaign as something that we should do and we would bring forward, but they have seen the value in it and have decided to continue to work collaboratively. It was -

Sitting suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.


MOTION

Committee Establishment

Resumed from above.

Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I had more I wanted to say on the nation-leading work that has been done. I congratulate the government for picking this up. I understand the Westbrook family was here this morning and we have another important piece of legislation to get to. The summarised version of what I want to say is that we are here speaking about a family domestic and sexual violence committee. We need to be very conscious in this place of how we are treating one another and the language we use. What we say here, what we say to the media, we don't have control of where that might go; but what we do have control over is what we post on social media, where we post it and the language used. That goes for everybody right across the Chamber.

What we do as leaders in this place is then amplified throughout the community. We need to make sure that what we are doing is to the highest possible standard. If we understand that something we have done is becoming out of control, perhaps it's out of our circumstances, but we have a mechanism in place to fix it, be it taking down a post, making another statement to the media, coming into this place and simply saying, 'Hey, I said the wrong thing and I'm sorry.' That is what we need to be doing because that is the sort of behaviour we would expect from everyday Tasmanians and that is what everybody right across the Chamber needs to be modelling in this place.

[2.32 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, a lot has been said about respectful behaviour and you have set the tone, honourable Speaker. We have heard how we expect in this place, as leaders, to operate and treat each other and members of the public.

I won't talk about the new committees, but I will have a little word about the joint sessional committee on the Parliamentary Library. I thank the minister for bringing it to the House. This is clearly a sought-after committee to be on. It has a cast of thousands. But seriously, we did talk before about getting rid of the Library Committee. It is a statutory committee, if I'm correct, so it can't just be absorbed into the House committee. I believe the government will be looking at that.

I want to talk about the history of the library. Not for too long, don't worry, but I believe this is information. We talk a lot about information, misinformation and disinformation in these times. It is important to make sure we have a repository of information that we can all access.

The library was first established in 1852, and then the select committee of the Legislative Council was appointed to manage the library in March 1852. It is certainly steeped in history. It then went to a joint management committee. A lot of the repository of the library has survived on limited space. It has also been important for newspaper clippings in 1975, and it now is responsible for a lot of the digital preservation.

In 1990 the Parliamentary Research Service was introduced. It was introduced at a time when the Green independents and independents were starting to populate the House, so having information available for members of the crossbench and members of the opposition to gain discreetly was very important. I did not actually meet Bryan Stait, who was very important in this place and very well respected. Unfortunately, he died - 

Mr Barnett - Yes, a wonderful man.

A member - A great man.

A member - Yes, amazing.

Ms BURNET - Yes, there is a lot of acclamation and recognition of the work that Bryan did. That Parliamentary Research Service is very important.

I suppose with libraries, sometimes you want to step into a place where it is not as rowdy or intense as this Chamber has been this morning. I find the library so welcoming. It is a neutral space and, in the hubbub of parliament, often a nice quiet place to go and do background reading. The oversight of knowledge is very important. We have to keep that knowledge safe and we have to grow in that knowledge. We have the historical records; it is fascinating. However, we also need those things like the Parliamentary Research Service. I urge everybody to use that special library service. We need this committee to ensure that those things held in such high esteem over many years, with such history, are looked after and survive into the future.

Recognition of Visitors

The SPEAKER - Before I call on the next member, I would like to acknowledge and welcome staff of Hansard who are in the public gallery watching us all today. Thank you for everything you do for us as well.

Members - Hear, hear.
———————————————————
[2.37 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, in relation to the Library Committee, this is a welcome addition. In debating all these committees, I mentioned the other day the work of parliamentary staff and how important that is. As we go into a budget development process and session, we need to make the resourcing in this place actually matches the demands upon it. I put before the Treasurer our expectation and hope that parliamentary staff are resourced adequately to deliver the work we are expecting of them and that we are setting them up to deliver through these motions. 

Motion agreed to.


SITTING DATES

[2.38 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of Government Business)(by leave) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House at its rising adjourn until Tuesday 23 September next at 10.00 a.m.

I usually wouldn't speak to a motion such as this, but this will allow another instalment of the much-viewed Question Time for all the 'hap' people in the world, as opposed to the hapless people.

Motion agreed.


MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Evidence Based Harm Minimisation and EGMs

[2.39 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House take note of the following matter: evidence based harm minimisation and EGMs 

Poker machines are not entertainment. They are precision-engineered devices designed with one purpose: to keep people playing and to keep them losing. The industry doesn't rely on guesswork. They use science - the science of addiction. Every light, every sound, and every near miss is designed to trigger the brain's reward system. One manufacturer even described it as building a better mouse trap. Pokies are deliberately crafted to hook people and they are devastatingly effective.

Last month alone, Tasmanians has lost around $18 million on pokies. In Glenorchy, my community, about $1.7 million vanishes every single month. That money isn't coming out of nowhere. It's rent, power bills, groceries, and school costs. It's families going without so that pokies barons can keep turning a profit. Let's put $18 million in a single month into perspective. That could pay for hundreds of social housing units, or wipe power bills for thousands of struggling families. Instead, it disappears into machines designed to bleed people dry.

Here's the problem: we are losing this fight. While the industry uses evidence to cause harm, we are not using evidence to prevent it. The evidence is clear. Independent reports, including the recommendations of the Victorian Royal Commission into Crown Casino, have shown that the most effective tool we have is a mandatory player precommitment card.

Mr Ferguson - Hear, hear.

Ms JOHNSTON - Thank you. This system requires people to set their own binding limits before they start gambling, preventing them from continuing to gamble until their limit resets, preventing escalation before harm takes hold.

The government knows this, which is why in 2022 it commissioned the Tasmanian Liquor and Gaming Commission to develop a player card for Tasmania. It did the work and it was planned and ready to roll out until government caved in to the pokies barons and hospitality interests last year.

The Chair of the Tasmanian Liquor and Gaming Commission, Jenny Cranston, said publicly:

The other harm reduction initiatives that government has committed to, including facial recognition, are ineffective.

I'm incredibly disappointed and very saddened by the fact that we had almost within our grasp the ground-breaking initiative that would protect so many Tasmanians and be so good for this industry. [tbc]

The evidence shows facial recognition technology doesn't work. Self-excluded gamers are still slipping through and losing yet more money. Self-exclusion itself is usually a last resort. After serious harm has already occurred, it's not prevention; it's triage.

Its other plans include to have gaming care officers - people who are trained in responsible conduct at gaming - roaming venues to supposedly intervene when they see gambling harm occurring. This is simply something the industry has cooked up because they know it will not harm their profits. Again, the evidence, including from Victoria's Royal Commission, shows this approach is not effective.

In trying to justify its backflips and the player card, the government said it will wait and see what other states do. However, just two days ago, the Premier stood in this place and boasted, 'We're not followers in Tasmania, we're leaders.' He even said he looked forward to the day when other states would follow Tasmania's lead. If that's true, why not lead on pokies harm minimisation too?

The research is also clear - Tasmanians want action on pokies. They know the harm these machines cause and they want to see less harm in our communities. The Premier himself has spoken about the need to secure the sustainability and social licence of the salmon industry. The social licence of pokies would be a hell of a lot stronger if the industry allowed effective harm-minimisation measures. Let us be clear: introducing a player card is unlikely to threaten the long-term sustainability of the industry. We'd know for sure, if the government had honoured its promise to release the Deloitte report into the impact of the player card on the industry, as it was published last year. Yet Tasmanians are still waiting.

Leadership means protecting Tasmanians now; not after more lives have been shattered, not after more families are driven into poverty. This is a public-health issue. Just as we treat tobacco, alcohol and other drugs with evidence-based harm reduction, so too we must treat poker machines. Tasmanians expect and deserve no less. The poker industry is already using evidence, but they use it to addict. Our job is to use the evidence to protect. That means backing the strongest, most effective harm-minimisation measures we have: a mandatory precommitment card. One day we will look back on this day; I hope we're standing on the right side of history.

[2.44 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Clark for bringing this MPI on. I acknowledge up front her long and strong history in tackling this scourge. Pokies are indeed a scourge. They are a significant scourge on our society and they cost us dearly. They are designed to addict. They are programmed to win. They are located in some of the most vulnerable communities across our state.

They cost us very dearly. Just recently, the losses from the pokies industry were articulated clearly on the Treasury website: $18.4 million lost statewide to poker machines in July 2025. One single month: $18.4 million, the highest losses since July 2020, back in the midst of COVID or thereabouts. It's almost $200 million statewide across the year, across 2024 and 2025. This is a significant amount of money and it's coming from some of our most vulnerable communities. 

My municipality of Clark is the biggest loser of all. Of course, in Glenorchy there is 'the Golden Mile'. In July, it sucked just under $2 million out of communities, vulnerable people. This is an absolute shame and it's a travesty and it's an indictment on our approach. Some of the other municipalities: $790,000 from Burnie; just under $1 million from Clarence, in the honourable Treasurer's electorate; $950,000 from Devonport; just over $1.5 million in Launceston.

This has really genuine and significant impacts on people. This is not a victimless industry. It's a driver of poverty and financial stress. Of course, that has impacts on partners, children and others. It delivers mental health and other personal health issues for people. It drives a scourge on our society, things such as domestic violence. This house has only just passed a motion to establish a committee looking into, amongst other things, domestic violence. We know that poker machines are one of the things - and the stress that they cause is one of the drivers of domestic violence. 

It drives crime and, in the most extreme cases, it can lead to the loss of life. This is not a victimless activity. This is not just a simple bet on a machine once or twice a year, because we know that because they are designed to addict, because they are designed to win, they are having significant impacts. Of course, that's costing us as a community. Not only are we paying for the medical care and the domestic violence and other treatments; not only are we paying for the policing that's dealing with the crime that is being driven by these pokies, but we are losing investment in our communities to small businesses, alternative things that people could be spending that $18 million a month on.

Just imagine the kind of investment that $2 million in Glenorchy could deliver to local businesses and the local community. This is being stripped from our community. It's an absolute indictment. Poker machines in pubs and clubs is a problem. It's a significant problem, but of course we have poker machines in casinos as well. If you want to know the breakdown between that: in July, 58 per cent of that $18.4 million losses was lost in clubs and pubs pokies, and 42 per cent was lost in casinos. So, the majority of the losses are delivered in those vulnerable communities, and some of these venues are staying open till 4 in the morning. We've heard from addicts. You talk to addicts about this and they just simply can't walk down the street without going into those places, so we do need harm minimisations. 

Cards are a really important way to deliver that, but of course that has been dropped by this government, and that is a shame. I acknowledge Mr Ferguson's commitment to this as part of government. We do know that he has been committed to it, but we know that it has now been dropped. We are deeply concerned and believe this has been dropped because of the donations to political parties. The TEC's registration, or declaration of donations to political parties, shows that the pokies industry has donated to both the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party just in the last couple of months. That is what is driving the policy inaction when it comes to harm minimisation in this state.

Time expired.

[2.49 p.m.]
Mr Di FALCO (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I appreciate the member for Clark's position on this and her consistent stance. I understand that this is a polarising topic and a lot of members in this Chamber have strong views and wish to express them. I will be brief. I'm a big advocate for freedom of choice and the right of hardworking Tasmanians to spend their money on legal activities. I understand the challenge the problem gamblers have. I sympathise with the constant battle they face. We need to ensure that they have all the support and assistance they require.

I have a strong belief in harm-minimisation measures; however, mandatory precommitment cards are not the answer. This costly initiative will impact on everyday Tasmanians who enjoy the experience of playing the pokies with their friends at their local pub. This will also be devastating to our pubs and clubs, which face significant cost increases every day on insurances, wages, goods and services.

I understand the gaming industry is piloting facial-recognition software that can identify excluded patrons from venues the moment they enter the premises. This allows the licensees or managers of venues to intervene early and ask them to leave and offer the assistance they require. The current system allows for problem gamblers to enter premises and freely access EGMs without being noticed, due to the lack of technology and updated procedures that the pub industry has been advocating for years for.

These measures, if implemented, will not stop problem gamblers; they will simply find another avenue such as online betting apps. Therefore, the money goes overseas instead of to family-owned Tasmanian businesses who reinvest this money into their businesses, which employs locals. I strongly support harm-minimisation measures that are cost effective and will provide the support and deterrence that is evidence based. Facial recognition should be in every pub and club in the state. Thank you.

[2.49 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the member, Ms Johnston, for bringing this as an MPI for discussion, and for her advocacy and for the advocacy of the Greens for many years, for Meg Webb, for Mr Ferguson.

Why these people advocated so hard for reigning in pokies is because they cause significant addiction. They cause significant harm and that is proven. It's evidence based, and that harm has to fight the powers of the money and the money provided to parties through donations. The political donation system that allows governments and parties to be bought is appalling and needs to be reined in itself.

Today is R U OK? Day; we're all wearing the badges. I know many people who have been impacted by the harm poker machines inflict on individuals, families and communities. I disagree with Mr Di Falco; addiction is not a choice. We see significant harm to individuals, communities and families. People lose their lives in relation to this. They lose their assets. Businesses suffer as well. 

It's not just about pubs and clubs. We shouldn't have pokies in pubs and clubs at all. The Greens have been very strong on this. Businesses suffer because of increased crime and lack of money. I know Ms Johnston has spoken a number of times about kids in cars who need to be fed whilst their parents are playing pokies. This is an appalling situation for our state. It is a scourge on our state.

I was so disappointed in October 2024 when the Premier announced that the government was going to walk away from the mandatory precommitment card. I'm pretty sure Mr Ferguson was upset about that as well, as were many in this House and in the community, including advocates who have been working hard to protect people.

Addiction is not a choice and we can do so much better. We could have had nation-leading technology and we've walked away from that. I still have hope that we will see the benefits of this to our communities. The north-west coast in Mr Garland's area really suffers, as does the 'Golden Mile', as Mr Bayley has said. These are vulnerable communities who cannot afford the harm of pokies in their communities. We as a parliament should be working towards reducing that harm.

[2.56 p.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I'd like to make a couple of points. Playing the pokies is not gambling. The game is fixed. It's rigged. I find it -
Mr Ferguson - Programmed.

Mr GARLAND - Programmed. Isn't it interesting that the gambling the Aussie diggers came up with, which is an even-money bet, inclusive, brings everybody in and is fair, is illegal, but here we're allowing a family to benefit - I think it's the Farrell family that has stables in Sydney - from gouging our most disadvantaged in the community.

I've lived through gambling. It is insidious. It takes food from the kids, it breaks down relationships and it instigates violence. It is absurd that we are allowing this to continue in this day and age, given the cost of living and everything else. These people cannot afford to lose this money. It's absolutely abhorrent. We haven't got the Sheriff of Nottingham coming around and lifting us upside down and draining the money out of our pocket. We've got these machines all over the state that benefit one family. If we can do one thing in this parliament, it should be to get that scourge out of the community and get those millions back into the families who desperately need it. I cannot overstate the importance of getting rid of this industry. It is terrible and abhorrent.

[2.58 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Treasurer) - Honourable Speaker, I delayed the government's response to this because I was genuinely interested in hearing the contributions of other members. Having been in this portfolio now for only three weeks, I confess I have not devoted my personal time to this, having a few other matters on my mind. That said, I have a few starting points. 

Gambling in general terms is a scourge. I don't like gambling. The consequences of it are there for all to see. However, I also believe in personal freedom and choice. In a free society people are entitled to make bad choices. That is where I sort of line up with some of the commentary from Ms Burnet and Mr Di Falco. They are the issues we need to consider in this debate.

The consequences of gambling, as outlined by Mr Garland, should be and need to be noted. I will not inquire as to what era Mr Garland refers to. It may well have been an era before those gaming machines when people used to lose their money at the racetrack, with the bookies, and elsewhere. Whilst the machines are addictive for some people, alcohol is addictive for some people as well. The vast majority of players of these machines, as I understand it, are not addicted.

Also in relation to Mr Garland's commentary, and I know it was genuine, referring to one family does not advance the debate. It is under a legal framework determined by this place. Mr Farrell and the family were welcomed at the time when they established the first legal casino in Tasmania, supported by a referendum of the people. To vilify one family is not the way to advance this debate. In fairness, a lot of local pub owners also get benefits and the relatively recent changes saw a bit of a redistribution. If you do not like what is occurring, don't blame the family or people who are benefiting from it, blame the licensing and the regime that we as a parliament have put in place.

In relation to having factual information on the Table, I am advised that Tasmania has the lowest density of electronic gaming machines of any state, the lowest spend per capita on gaming machines and the lowest prevalence of problem gambling. I am also advised that a cap of 3530 gaming machines was set on 1 July 2023 and the current operation of these machines is at a level of 3262, which is 268 machines under the cap. I want to see that decrease further.

I will also comment in relation to the high take for the venues in Glenorchy, for example. What I found is that, in those communities where there are a lot of contractors and overnight workers staying in the hotels, et cetera, they often are the ones who make the contribution to the machines, as opposed to the totality of the take coming from the locals.

Time expired.

[3.03 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, it is always interesting to hear what position the new minister responsible for gaming is going to take when it comes to this government because it changes pretty frequently. It changes from the former treasurer, Peter Gutwein, who was the architect of the reforms we brought in in 2021 which contained absolutely no new harm minimisation measures, not even a skerrick of attempted anything. Then, the minister, the former treasurer who eventually carried through those reforms. He spoke highly of his enthusiasm for harm minimisation at the time. He tried to implement them and then has variously claimed over the last 12 months that it was still government policy to have mandatory card-based play in the model he desired. 

I am looking forward to his contribution today because I might be able to understand what the government's position is today. It might be different to the position they took into the election because, let's face it, the deals they are doing and the letters they write don't seem to mean anything, and we have a crossbench showing a strong desire to change position on this.

We also have a former treasurer, the member for Bass, Mr Ferguson, who has a strong desire for the government to implement his policy. I don't know the status of the ministerial directive Mr Ferguson wrote to the commission some years ago is. The last we heard, publicly updated, was that the letter was still in place. There is still a directive from government to the commission to 'as soon as practicable', I believe were the words, implement mandatory card-based play. However, we have a Premier who says they are not going to do that and a Treasurer who - I will let the words he just spoke speak for themselves. I won't try and paraphrase him. However, the government's position on this is not very clear.

I understand the government has made its position differently to different people at different times, and I expect we are about to hear a quite a different position from the former treasurer to the current Treasurer, who are both members of the same government. So, who would know what this government's position is on gaming?

When it comes to gaming, Tasmanian Labor took a position to the 2018 state election to remove electronic gaming machines from pubs and clubs across Tasmania. We announced that position some four or five months before the election. We took a clear position to the electorate of Tasmania and said, 'This is what we will do.' The Tasmanian Liberal Party ran an almighty campaign against that position and it is a position that the Liberals took full well. Michael Ferguson, the honourable member for Bass, was one of the candidates who put posters up on the sides of pubs to fight against that position. 

The record shows that the people of Tasmania spoke and they re-elected the Liberal government, and we have changed our position since then. In 2021 we took a position to that debate which remains our position today. We support the implementation of facial recognition technology in Tasmanian pubs and clubs. I truly believe that is the best way to target problem gamblers in this state. It is working in South Australia in that people in South Australia who attend a pub or club with a gaming machine cannot do so if they are on the register. If they say they don't want to be there, they won't be there because they will be immediately identified. It helps workers on site, it helps problem gamblers, and it helps to make sure that people who are enjoying gaming, as Tasmanians are more than entitled to do, can do so safely if they want to. 

I am someone that enjoys, as people know, the racing industry and I am a regular punter. I am not someone who enjoys EGMS. That is for others, but it is their choice to make. Our position has not changed since 2021. We did take that position in 2018. It was rejected by the Tasmanian people, and we respect that position. 

In summing up, it would be good today to get some kind of clarity from the Tasmanian Liberal government, whatever faction or side of it wants to speak, about what their position is. The former treasurer states that it is still their position to implement this card-based play. That is very different to the current Premier, who says they are not going to do it.

Mr SHELTON (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to talk briefly on this issue and support freedom of choice. I can recall a number of times going through the debate on this issue. I am aware of people in regional communities that use the opportunity to go down to their local pub to have a play on the pokies and to socialise. This story came from a couple of older ladies who get together of a Thursday, and that is their social time. They get together, they have lunch, they play the pokies, they put a bit of money through it. That is their social outing for the week and it is what keeps them going through the week. I have probably put $20 through a pokie in my life, but I don't mind a gamble. For some people, that is their thing. 

Problem gambling is an issue, of course, and we cannot back away from that. We know that legalising, creating a legal situation, allows some control over it. I relate it to what is happening in the tobacco industry at the moment. When you create a situation where you tax above and beyond, and create a black market in anything, then the government and society have no control over it. Before legalised gambling, there were backyard deals and gambling. Gambling has always been there and it has always created a situation where certain individuals will go and either try to make a fortune or whatever. It was illegal and the government had no ability to derive any income out of it. You still had problem gamblers in amongst that. If you want the income to put into problem gamblers, you need to have a regime that allows that to happen.

I heard when I was watching TV the vilification of the family. In my time at Meander Valley Council, the Country Club Casino, owned by the Farrell family, is a significant investment into the community by that family. They are undergoing a revamp at the moment, spending literally millions of dollars on revamping the golf course and investing in our community. They pay significant rates to the local council. The legalised process is not about ripping a whole heap of money out of the Tasmanian community. They have been through a process to gain a licence. They had the monopoly for a period and that was a great conversation piece, shall I say, within this House. As a government, we removed that from them. A certain percentage of pokies now are within the country clubs and pubs, and it is what makes country pubs and clubs viable nowadays. 

Some people may not know but there is not a lot of money in the pub any more. There is not a lot of people going to the pub and having a drink of alcohol. It maintains viability of those facilities and, therefore, those local communities that use that facility to have a meal of a night and whatever. If it becomes unviable and that closes down, if it is the only one in the town, there is nowhere for that community to go, or they have to get in a car and travel somewhere else to go and have a local meal. Even if they don't play the pokies, it helps to support that facility in that regional community. Without them, that would be an issue for that local community. 

It isn't simple when we start talking about these things. It is multifaceted and we must always remember that. The government and what comes out of this place will always be the law, but it is not just one argument.

Matter noted.


JUSTICE AND RELATED LEGISLATION (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL 2025 (No. 38)

Second Reading

[3.13 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice, Corrections and Rehabilitation) - Honourable Speaker, before I begin my second reading speech I'd like to acknowledge in the Chamber today Jason and Amanda Westbrook, Dante and Skye as well, and Chase. I can't see Echo, but I think she's there as well; a couple of the grandkids. It is a very special day for the Westbrook family and of course many others as well.

Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the bill be now read the second time.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this important amendment bill. This bill contains amendments that update, clarify and improve four different acts, three of which are within my Justice portfolio and one that falls under the responsibility of the Minister for Housing and Planning and Consumer Affairs [actually, Consumer Affairs is one of Barnett's!].

In September last year, I informed the House that I was obtaining advice on the avenues available to family members to access coronial records. One of the amendments in this bill is made in response to that advice, and I'd like to take this opportunity to again acknowledge the Westbrook family and their continued efforts to advocate for an improved coronial system in Tasmania. Their advocacy was born out of the tragic loss of Eden Westbrook and it is recognised that they provide a unique perspective on coronial processes in Tasmania, so my heartfelt condolences remain with the Westbrooks.

Members - Hear, hear.

Mr BARNETT - The Coronial Division of the Magistrates Court has an important role to play in Tasmania's justice system.

The remaining amendments in the bill arise from requests from the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, the Director of Public Prosecutions and WorkSafe Tasmania within the Department of Justice, so I'll now outline the reasons for each of the proposed amendments in turn.

This bill amends the Coroners Act to insert section 58C that requires coronial records be provided to the senior next of kin in certain circumstances. The Coroners Act specifies that the senior next of kin is the first available person in a list contained in section 3A of the act, commencing with the deceased's current spouse. Section 3 of the act defines 'spouse' as including the other party to a significant relationship within the meaning of the Relationships Act 2003. The act sets out the procedures for investigations and inquests by coroners and in doing so allocates various rights to the senior next of kin. It is therefore appropriate to extend the amendment to this person.

Under general principles of law, the right of a senior next of kin can also be exercised by their nominated person or agent. This means a senior next of kin does not personally have to receive the records if they prefer another person, such as a trusted friend or advisor, to make the request and receive the record on their behalf. The amendment also does not prohibit the senior next of kin sharing the record with other people, for example, other family members, an independent expert or legal representative.

Some senior next of kin may wish to obtain a record without wishing to view it themselves, but in order to provide to another person. This can be dealt with administratively, for example, by the senior next to kin receiving a sealed envelope or electronic files in such a way that they do not have to view the records themselves.

I note that other persons may still apply for access to coronial records under Rule 26 of the Coroners Rules 2006.

Under section 58C, the senior next of kin may apply in writing for a coronial record. The definition of a coronial record includes any record held by the court in relation to an investigation of a death under the Coroners Act and includes a postmortem report, a document on the court's file and a transcript or recording of oral evidence given to the court. This definition includes all evidentiary material held by the court in relation to a coronial investigation of a death, including documents, photographs and other material of evidentiary value. 

The definition also includes such records as can be lawfully provided to the court under this or any other act. That ensures that the court can obtain relevant information that it may not currently hold on the file to disclose to the senior next of kin. For example, this might include autopsy photographs held by the pathologist who informed the written report but are not on the court file. 

A coronial authority may not refuse a request unless satisfied on reasonable grounds that release of the coronial record, firstly, is prohibited by the act or another act such as section 57 of the act which, when appropriate, restricts publication of reports of proceedings; or would be contrary to national security or personal security; or would prejudice the investigation of breaches of the law, the administration of the law, or a fair trial of a person. For example, it may be that certain information cannot be disclosed until related criminal proceedings are concluded. In the event that release of the record would be refused on these grounds, the coronial authority may redact the record to the extent necessary to enable the record to be released.

Honourable Speaker, the draft bill that was released for public consultation proposed an additional ground based on the impact to the health and wellbeing of the senior next of kin in receiving a coronial record. The draft proposed to refer a copy of the coronial record to a medical practitioner nominated by the senior next of kin. The intended purpose of this was to facilitate a discussion between the senior next of kin and medical practitioner about the record and provide an opportunity to discuss any medical terminology used. After the discussion, if the senior next of kin still wished to have a copy of the record, the medical practitioner could release it to them.

The bill before the parliament has been amended to remove this ground based on the feedback from Mr and Mrs Westbrook and consideration of submissions and approaches in other jurisdictions. This recognises that the question of whether to seek medical advice or counselling before viewing the records provided is ultimately a matter for the senior next of kin and not appropriate to mandate in the bill. The bill was also amended based on their feedback and with consideration of submissions and other jurisdictions to require the coronial authority to apply to all coronial records, not just postmortem records. 

I have personally met with Jason and Amanda Westbrook, and I am grateful for the information they have shared with me and for the time they have taken to provide feedback on these amendments.

The bill also includes amendments which I moved on the Floor of this place on 6 May 2025 to ensure the rights of the senior next of kin to appropriate records are promoted. These amendments replace the power to impose conditions on the use or release of the record, with a power only to order that the record not be published, ensuring that use of records by a senior next to kin is not subject to other kinds of restriction.

Further, they insert a ground to refuse a request for a record if the coroner is satisfied on reasonable grounds that it would be contrary to the public interest to release the record due to the release having an unreasonable intrusion on the privacy of another person other than the deceased person to which the request relates. The record can still be released in redacted form. 
Finally, they insert an appeal provision to either the Chief Magistrate or the Supreme Court, so a senior next of kin has a clearer process for review of a coroner's decision.

These amendments passed this place unopposed, and I thank members here today who participated in that vote for their support and collaborative approach. 

I have continued to consider these issues, and I can advise the House that the bill contains a further amendment which was not included in its previous iteration before the previous parliament. This amendment requires the coronial record to be provided within 28 days after the request is made, or such longer period as is agreed with the senior next of kin, and an avenue for review if there is a failure to comply with that timeframe. This will ensure the timely provision of coronial records.

The amendments to the Coroners Act 1995 provide for a clear and direct right of access by senior next of kin to coronial records. This is essential, in the spirit of open justice, to ensure transparency, accountability and public confidence in our justice system.

I also hope that the provision of this material can provide some amount of closure to families following an investigation into a death. I would like to express my appreciation for the hard work of the chief coroner, the coroners, the coronial division and many others involved in this jurisdiction. They do a great service to the community, with over 1000 reportable deaths investigated in 2023-24 and 31 inquests that year. They have worked to facilitate access to records under their current practices and rules. They provide support to family members every day.

I particularly note the great initiative of a dedicated coronial liaison officer who assists family members to understand the coronial process and come to terms with the grief and trauma of losing loved ones. There have been understandable concerns in the community that the right balance of access to records has not been clearly provided for in the legislation to date. This bill gets the balance right, to ensure access to these records by senior next of kin, acknowledging the sensitive and private nature of these records. I am pleased that this bill provides certainty and clarity to the law for the community and the court.

Amendments to the Corrections Act 1997: part 3 of the bill makes minor technical amendments to update sections 68 and 69 of the Corrections Act 1997. These amendments reflect the repeal of sections 19 of the Sentencing Act 1997 and the commencement of its replacement, section 7 of the Dangerous Criminals and High Risk Offenders Act 2021. Section 98 of the TASCAT Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2020, is about representation of a party to proceedings. It says that a party to proceedings before TASCAT is entitled to appear personally, be represented by a lawyer or, with leave of TASCAT, be represented by another representative.

The bill amends section 98(3)(c) to allow a lawyer subject to disciplinary proceedings under the Legal Profession Act 2007, or corresponding law in another state or territory, to appear as a representative. This prohibition is proposed to be removed on the basis that disciplinary proceedings are not necessarily an indicator of wrongdoing. It presupposes a finding of guilt before proceedings are resolved. Frivolous or vexatious disciplinary proceedings brought by third parties may unfairly impact upon lawyers, preventing them from appearing before TASCAT.

Under the Legal Profession Act 2007, the legal profession board of Tasmania may suspend a lawyer's practising certificate if they are subject to a disciplinary proceeding. In those circumstances, a lawyer will not be eligible to appear under section 98(3)(a) of the TASCAT Act. This remains unchanged.

Amendments to the Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1998: Currently, under the Workers Rehabilitation Compensation Act 1998, a workers compensation certificate must be signed by a medical practitioner. The amendment to this act inserts section 77I, which provides that, in certain circumstances, a nurse practitioner may also sign a workers compensation certificate. A nurse practitioner may issue a certificate if they are employed in an emergency department of a hospital or other prescribed circumstance, or for prescribed purposes and in issuing the certificate they are acting in accordance with that employment.

The bill also requires that the issue of any certificate may be in accordance with a certificate protocol. A certificate protocol must be prepared by the Department of Health and approved by the secretary of the Department of Health and the WorkCover Tasmania Board. It will outline the circumstances or conditions under which a nurse practitioner may issue a certificate: for example, that a certificate be time limited or relate to new injuries that have not been previously treated.

A certificate protocol will come into force seven days after it has been approved and must be published on the Department of Health website. This provides time for nurse practitioners to be notified. Nurse practitioners are advanced practice nurses, educated to a masters level in their specialty of practice. Nurse practitioners can assess and treat patients, order diagnostic tests and write prescriptions. This amendment will reduce duplication and service costs and result in a more efficient health system, as patients will no longer require reassessment by a medical practitioner for the purposes of a workers compensation certificate. It will also improve the patient experience, as an injured worker will no longer have to wait to see a doctor for that important piece of paper.

I thank members of the public who provided comments on this bill, as well as other justice stakeholders who were consulted during the drafting of this bill. Your feedback was carefully considered and is valued. It ensures that Tasmania's legislation is fit for purpose. I commend the bill to the House.

[3.29 p.m.]

Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Justice and Related Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2025. I can indicate that the opposition will be supporting the bill.

I just want to open my remarks by also recognising the Westbrook family. Thank you for being here in the parliament today on what I'm sure feels like an important day because of the changes that are being made, but no doubt also feels like a really heartbreaking day. I want to recognise your tenacity and your strength in fighting for justice after the tragic death of Eden. I recognise that it's now more than 10 years since she died. No parents should bury a child. I'm very sorry for your loss. You've done a service to Tasmanians by fighting for this change. I want to thank you sincerely for that. I want to thank the government for making the change.

We heard from the Attorney-General that he's had several personal meetings with you and your family. I've read the contribution that you made on the previous version of the consultation draft on the bill. I recognise that some further changes were made to the final version that hit this parliament. I recognise the government for doing that consultation work very sensitively and respectfully of your family and your loss.

I also recognise that we did deal with this bill in May, and so it's been further delayed by just a few months. That won't happen again. I don't think there's going to be any proroguing or election coming in the way of this bill making its way through this Chamber, up to the Upper House and then across the hill to the Governor for royal assent. It is so important that these changes are made. I did put a lot of comments on the record during the debate in May. I don't intend to go through to the same level of detail as I did last time, but I will just go through a little bit more and recognise some of the changes, but also put a couple of questions on the record as well.

The most substantive changes in this bill, as we've heard, do amend the Coroners Act 1995 to provide that direct access for senior next of kin to coronial records. The bill inserts a new provision to clarify that the senior next of kin will be provided with a copy of the coronial record they seek, unless one of a range of exceptions applies. It specifies that a coronial record includes records held by the coronial division in relation to the investigation of a death, or which can be provided lawfully by the coronial division under the Coroner's Act 1995. This includes postmortem reports, other records or documents including autopsy photographs, and transcripts or recordings of oral evidence given to the coronial division of the court.

It recognises that coronial records can be sensitive and does provide for these requests from a senior next of kin. It recognises that the coronial authority can only refuse a request if they're satisfied on reasonable grounds that the release of the record either is prohibited by legislation; would be an unreasonable intrusion on the privacy of a person referred to in the coronial record other than the deceased person to whom the request relates and contrary to the public interest due to that intrusion on the privacy of the third person; or would be likely to prejudice the investigation of a breach or possible breach of the law, enforcement to the proper administration of the law, the fair trial of a person, or would be contrary to national security or personal security. My understanding, Attorney-General, is that if one of these exceptions or limitations applies, that parts of the record could still be released in a redacted form. I want to clarify that. Also, I know I asked this question last time, but I haven't had the chance to refresh my memory of the answer that you no doubt gave in your summing up back in May 2025. My other question is whether - if a coroner determines that they can't release a record in full - whether the senior next of kin will be given information that something exists but that there's been a decision not to release it. I wondered if you could clarify that in your summing up as well.

I really appreciate those amendments that were moved in May, particularly the time limit of 28 days that a request needs to be provided, and I recognise the seriousness of that. I also want to put on the record, as the Attorney-General did, respect for the work of the Coronial Division and of the coroners, the Chief Coroner and all of the team that do an incredible job investigating more than 1000 reportable deaths a year, I believe he said. 

That was a welcome amendment, as were the appeal rights. That's a very important thing as well, so that families led by the senior next of kin, whoever that person may be designated to be, are able to appeal a decision if there is a decision not to release some information. That's a very important element of this bill as well. I think it's one of those areas of law or areas of public policy that people don't think about very much until their lives are touched by it. It's the part of public administration that we would all hope we don't need to interact with. Unfortunately, for so many Tasmanians, we do find ourselves needing to interact with public administration after the death of a loved one. That's inevitably happening at a time of extreme grief and all the other things that come alongside the death of somebody close to you. 

Added to that, having the administrative task of trying to find information from a public authority - it's not an easy task. The fact that these changes have been made with consultation with people like the Westbrooks and others who have been impacted is very important because, I believe, the best decisions that can be made in public policy are the ones that are informed by community and informed by the people who are affected by them.

I think that was the bulk of the questions that I wanted to ask about the changes to the Coroners Act. 

The other changes in the bill are relatively administrative. With the change to the Corrections Act, I don't feel the need to add any more comments than what I did in May. Similarly, the changes to the TASCAT Act, I don't intend to add to my comments from the last debate on this bill in May.

I will make a few short comments about the Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1998. As the second reading speech outlined and the attorney general explained, currently only medical practitioners can issue workers compensation certificates. Amendments to the Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. These amendments will allow nurse practitioners to issue workers compensation certificates if they are issued in an emergency department of a hospital or other prescribed settings or for a prescribed purpose.

The recent election campaign shows that I'm a big fan of the work of nurse practitioners and that was met with some opposition from others in the medical profession. When, at the recent election campaign, we made some election commitments about increasing the workforce of nurse practitioners across Tasmania. They're a vital element of primary health service delivery and so often work in partnership with GPs, with pharmacists, with allied health professionals - not to stray too far out of the relevance to the bill - but that's what our policy sought to do. It would add the very important element of a primary healthcare team that nurse practitioners provide to multidisciplinary teams around Tasmania. It was not to replace GPs with nurse practitioners, which is what it was characterised as in the media.

The reason that I go into that detail is that nurse practitioners work in a range of settings. Often they work in GP clinics or in pharmacies. There are some pharmacies that have regular visits from nurse practitioners. Sometimes nurse practitioners will be able to operate out of community organisations like community houses. I know there was funding during COVID for a nurse practitioner to work out of the Glenorchy Salvos in my electorate. She did incredible work dealing with some longstanding health issues of people in the Glenorchy community.

The reason I put that background into the debate today is just to ask whether thought was given to allowing nurse practitioners to be involved with issuing workers compensation certificates outside of an emergency department hospital setting, recognising that they work in a range of different settings. I don't have the copy of the letter, but I have a copy of what I said in May. My concerns were similar to those raised by Unions Tasmania. They welcomed that reform of allowing nurse practitioners to issue medical certificates. They recognise that they are appropriately skilled to do so and that there are clear benefits to injured workers in not having the additional time, delays or expense of obtaining medical certificates from a doctor, recognising that there are GP access issues across our state.

Unions Tasmania went on to say that their position, which aligned with their affiliate the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF), was that nurse practitioners should not be confined to issuing medical certificates in emergency departments, but should be able to practise autonomously as part of their scope of clinical practice and as recognised by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia. Can the Attorney-General update the House on whether there is thought to expand the settings in which nurse practitioners will be able to issue workers compensation certificates?

As I said, I don't intend to speak to the other administrative changes made in the bill. I did that in May. My comments are on the public record for those changes. I wanted to put on the record those few questions that I had regarding the Coroners Act changes, and regarding nurse practitioners issuing workers compensation certificates.

I again pay my respects to the Westbrook family for being here today.

[3.42 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, the Greens will be supporting this amendment to Justice and Related Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill today. I particularly want to speak to the amendments to the Coroners Act, with which the Greens in our small way have been involved with a number of different cases of people.

For Hansard, I want to recognise - hello - we have Jason and Amanda in the Chamber with us today. Dante, who I heard speak at a rally, was here earlier. Sky and Echo are also here, I think. Thank you again for travelling all the way down here. This is an important day to have some closure, and to enable a process to be undertaken, which you've been fighting for, to get access to records and this legislation will enable you to get access to those records. We're deeply grateful to be able to play a small part in moving this on.[all names TBC]

I recognise that while there appeared to be initial resistance, I want to mention the previous attorney-general, Elise Archer, who started this conversation - and especially you, Attorney-General, for the work that you have done in making sure that this matter of justice has been delivered. It is especially for the Westbrooks to be able to access records for your beloved daughter, Eden, and to really understand the circumstances of what happened to her. 

There are many other Tasmanians who have hit against what appears to them an administrative wall at a time of grief when they want to have access to records. I have also personally advocated for former Australian Greens senator Janet Rice. I know she would feel okay about me mentioning her situation because she went to the ABC and was on the public record about it. She also hit a bureaucratic administrative wall which was deeply painful for her when her beloved wife, Penny Whetton, died in unexpected circumstances. A coronial investigation was undertaken. The question for her was to be able to access records accompanying the coroner's report from medical practitioners. She was getting a 'no' about being able to access them, except through a GP. Finally, after months of advocating, the records were released to a GP but she was not allowed to view them. That was a real injustice for a woman with the searing intelligence of Janet Rice to not be able to look at records and make her own determination about the issue.

Removing the mediation of the medical profession from this space allows senior next-of-kin to make their own decisions about whether they need to get counselling before they access records. Or, as the Attorney-General said, they might decide to pass the records through to a third party that can access the records so they don't themselves have to be exposed to the material. These small things matter so much. When you said there were over 1000 coronial investigations just last year, Attorney-General, that speaks to the volume of people this legislation will affect. We have just a few people in the Chamber here today but thousands of other Tasmanians.

Thank you, Attorney-General, for bringing it on and for bringing in the 28-day period because it is important to have a deadline. I want to put on the record the Greens' respect and thanks to the Chief Coroner, the Coroners Office, the Coronial Division and all their staff who do the work. It is a lot of work. The Attorney-General needs to make a passionate plea to get more funding for the Coroners Office. This is a very tight budget but when you look at the sort of cases they are investigating, some enormous multi-person deaths they have to look at, the complexity is huge. We want the work to be done as forensically and correctly as possible because it is about getting justice for people when they have passed away. It is critical that we have confidence in their work and that requires a budget sufficient to resource them for the work they do. I am sure you hear this on all the issues, Attorney-General, but I am sure you will advocate and do your best on that matter.

When you are summing up, maybe you can speak about how long you think - if, for example, the Westbrooks made an application, I would hope that this may be able to move through the other place in the next week. We cannot prescribe the timing, but it would be excellent if it did and then it could get royal assent. We would hope that there might be a 28-day period before the end of the year. That would be desirable, given the election interrupted what otherwise might have happened earlier. 

The honourable member for Clark, the shadow portfolio holder, Ms Haddad, asked about subsection (5) of 58C, which is where the coronial authority may refuse to provide records when there is an unreasonable intrusion on the privacy of a person who's referred to in the record who is not the deceased person but another person.

I also wondered about that, but I see proposed subsection (6) of proposed section 58C does enable the coroner to release the records redacted, so they can be redacted and modified and that, therefore, would mean that there there's no argument for the records not to be released; they just have to be appropriately anonymised, as I understand it.

In relation to nurse practitioners, the Greens strongly welcome the removal of any barriers to nurse practitioners being able to work fully and to extend into the scope of work that their capabilities enable them to cover. This change to the Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will allow nurse practitioners to issue workers compensation certificates in accordance with the certificate protocols that have been approved by the secretary of the Department of Health and the WorkCover board, so that's great.

Nurse practitioners are a vital plank in the community. Their time has slowly come into being. There's been fighting for so long. Let's just make a general global statement about when women try to break into professions that have been male dominated sometimes it can take centuries, but we get there in the end and I think there is now acceptance that nurse practitioners have the competence. They have so much space to work in between the GP and all the other professional staff, particularly in community settings, and we really need that in Tasmania because we need more fantastically skilled professionals in the community. 

I've seen what can happen in a Cygnet family practice where Kerrie Duggan[checked], in particular, has done an incredible job of single handedly making this enormous change and pushing ahead with an after-hours emergency response service that is available in a rural area that would otherwise be totally unprovided for out of hours. It's been really life-changing for people in my community.

There are still other administrative roadblocks that can be removed to allow nurse practitioners, emergency responders and paramedics to be able to fully expand their scope of practice and their capabilities. We need to harmonise our legislation with other states so that we're all working to best practice. I understand that is not your area, Attorney-General, but it's something that I will keep working on with the government to make sure that happens sooner rather than later.

They were the main things I wanted to say. I put a lot of my other comments on the record previously.

It's really important to end by thanking the staff of the department for the work and the briefings we had initially on these amendments. I am really grateful to be working with other members in the House to finally have this little piece of the puzzle that will allow the Westbrooks to get this investigation to understand what happened. We wish you all the best and we will do whatever we can to facilitate anything else that needs to be done to get justice.

[3.53 p.m.]
Mr GEORGE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I can't speak about the terminology of the law; it's not in my area. However, I can speak about its intent. The honourable Attorney-General has obviously put his good officers to work on this. I know that it's his job. I also think that it's come from his heart as well. He's a good man who has promoted this amendment bill, which I hope will help the Westbrooks on what is still a considerable odyssey as they search into the causes and reasons behind the death of their daughter a whole decade ago.

We all recognise that this is a long overdue amendment. As a young reporter in the 1970s in other jurisdictions I reported several stories about families who found that the bureaucracy and the administration of the law presented a roadblock rather than easing the way for families to find out what had happened to their loved ones. I recognise that this will still be a very long journey for the Westbrook family. 

May I say to the Attorney-General that I commend this amendment, but I want to see him root out the little pieces of arcane law hidden in corners that militate against families and victims from understanding what happened to them. There is too much bureaucracy that prevents people completing their journey. In the interests of transparency and accountability, which we all search for in this House, if we can root out those little bits of law and encourage those people who are involved in the administration of law to take the default position that people should know and understand what has happened rather than hiding it behind the bureaucracy or behind legislation, we will have a happier state and more people ending their odyssey feeling that they have discovered the truth.

[3.56 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice, Corrections and Rehabilitation) - Honourable Speaker, I want to say upfront thank you very much for the remarks that have been shared by the honourable members, my shadow attorney-general, the Leader of the Greens and the honourable member for Franklin, Peter George, Thank you for your remarks and your support for the bill and the motivation behind it. It's really appreciated. Thank you for recognising the Westbrook family who are here today for obviously incredibly important reasons for them.

It's been a long journey, as has been made very clear, more than 10 years now for the family. For me, it has been a little more than three years, firstly as a member for Lyons as a local member, and then as Attorney-General now for just short of two years. I have been on that journey with the family. It's been a privilege and a pleasure, albeit challenging at times on that journey.

I also acknowledge Senator Jacqui Lambie for her advocacy at the federal level in the Senate and asking important questions in the public arena for and on behalf of the family. She is always well motivated to get a result. Likewise, I acknowledge others in this place. We debated this and it passed in the House of Assembly on 6 May this year. It was not debated in the upper House, but there was feedback from there. I acknowledge the honourable Mike Gaffney, particularly for the suggestion that a response be provided within 28 days. We have taken that suggestion, which we have taken on board as a government through consultation, through collaboration, and, basically, good feedback. Lots of goodwill and suggestions coming onto the table. I indicated that in my second reading speech. We've picked up important feedback along the way and have delivered accordingly.

First, I will deal with the honourable member's comments about rooting out all the areas that need fixing in our various laws which are decades old. On 2 May I announced a review of the Coroners Act 1995. The Coroners Act 1995 is well-due for a review, it's fair to say. I want to commend and thank the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute for their good work, Jeremy Pritchard, a fine executive director, and, of course, there's a board and they do a great job. They do excellent research. That work is now underway. There will be a root and branch review of the Coroners Act 1995, I don't know exactly how long. They will take as long as they need to get the job done and then report back. That will be a public document, report and recommendations. We will take that very seriously. I wanted to note that.

I also want to note, in that regard, that I've talked with and met with, on a number of occasions, the Chief Magistrate and Chief Coroner directly, as well as the Secretary of my department. I thank them all for their input and their support. They support that review of the Coroners Act 1995. There is full support across government and across our legal system for that review.

I won't go through all the terms of reference now. It's on the public record. It's a very comprehensive terms of reference and it's consistent with our 2030 Strong Plan to deliver a better, fair and more accessible justice system that streamlines the processes and gets the best results for Tasmanians, improving access to justice - faster and fairer. 

It will enhance the role of the coroner in death prevention and in making recommendations, including in relation to public health, safety, administration of justice; any desirable changes to jurisdiction, powers, practices, or procedures of the coroner and its division that would better serve the needs of people interacting with the coronial division and the need of the community; any improvements to be made in the provision of information to, and support for, families, for friends, and others associated with the deceased person who is the subject of a coronial inquiry including, but not limited to issues regarding autopsies, cultural and spiritual beliefs and practices, counselling and the provisions of investigative, forensic and other services in support of the coronial function and other relevant matters. 

I wanted to draw that to your attention, to those that are listening, for those in the other House, so that's on the record that they're very aware that we're taking this seriously. We want a long-term, sustainable improvement in our law and access to justice.

I want to put on record my sincere thanks to the stakeholders who participated in the consultation process, the five submissions received, the Tasmanian Association of Vocational Rehabilitation Providers, Unions Tasmania, Civil Liberties Australia, Self-Insurers Association of Tasmania, and, of course, importantly, Jason and Amanda Westbrook. Thank you for your input through that process and of course, with me directly as an Attorney-General to my office, Amber Mignot, and many others in the department. I want to shout-out Amber, who's had a lot of contact with the Westbrook family over the last few years.

If I could address some of the questions and queries from the shadow attorney-general and Dr Woodruff. First, in terms of what information may a senior next of kin receive if a coronial record is redacted: I'm advised that when a coroner makes decisions under the act, the coroner gives reasons. The coroner is expected under this principle to explain what is refused or redacted, but under the amendment in the legislation, the senior next of kin may appeal certain matters in respect of their request if they've been aggrieved. A decision that one of the grounds to redact a record in clause 5 applies is an appealable matter.

In terms of the shadow attorney-general, with respect to the various exceptions that I made mention, if they apply, part of the record can be released in redacted form, subject to those exceptions. The answer is yes. 

In terms of why does the amendment only apply to emergency departments, this is with respect to workers rehabilitation -

Ms Haddad - Minister, before you move on to the next act - by interjection, if that's okay, Deputy Speaker. The second part of my question was: if a coroner determines not to release a record at all or something that exists in there, they've decided the whole thing is not to be released, redacted or otherwise, will the senior next of kin be advised of that decision? In other words, there are records that exist, but we've decided on these grounds not to release them at all. Do you know how that situation might be handled or communicated to the senior next of kin?

Mr BARNETT - All right, let me just check that. We've got the list of the exceptions, but I will just check in terms of how that's communicated. Yes, thanks very much for that question. And the answer is yes. It is communicated directly to the senior next of kin.

Ms Haddad - Okay, thank you.

Mr BARNETT - Thank you very much. In terms of the Workers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1998: the Department of Health and the WorkCover Board Tasmania recommended the amendment apply to emergency departments, being the places where it would have the biggest impact, alleviating duplication of work and inefficiencies which may adversely impact patient flow and create unnecessary service costs. It was recognised that although it should apply to emergency departments initially, it may be preferable to apply the amendment more broadly across other locations or settings. If appropriate, policies could be developed to support that process and if there was broad support from stakeholders.

In terms of what other prescribed circumstances or prescribed purposes may there be in the future: it may be desirable to prescribe circumstances to allow nurse practitioners to issue certificates at urgent care clinics, day procedure centres, general practices or other settings in the future, recognising the potential for the nurse practitioner profession to grow, as well as the increasing number of different care options available to injured workers in Tasmania. It is important to include this regulations-making power. As we're all aware, the regulations-making process in Tasmania is comprehensive and requires stakeholder consultation and an assessment of any burden, cost or disadvantage on any sector of the public.

I just wanted to acknowledge the Speaker and the former Minister for Health, who has a very special interest in this and actually drove this particular amendment in this bill. I want to give recognition and a shout-out to Jacquie Petrusma, who is not sitting here at the moment, our Speaker and a former Minister for Health. She really did drive this amendment and, of course, she's a former nurse and so for very good reason she could see the gap in the law that needed to be fixed. She brought it forward. I responded with the support of my department and here we are in parliament debating this and, I believe, supporting it, which is a good outcome. I want to acknowledge the honourable member for Franklin, Jacquie Petrusma.

Dr Woodruff also asked about when it would commence and the amendments. I think it's a very good question for all of us and the amendments commence, obviously, upon proclamation to ensure the Coronial Division can prepare for implementation and update forms and the like. Subject to consideration in the other place, the Department of Justice will advise the Coronial Division the bill will likely receive royal assent and to arrange proclamation ASAP. We have late this year or early next year, and I'm a very positive person and try to progress it as soon as possible. Certainly, I'd like to be aiming by the end of this year to land a result, but that will be subject to the other place and obviously getting royal assent. 

As soon as we know we've got a positive response coming, my department will communicate accordingly. The Coronial Division will be able to prepare their forms and prepare for the change in the law. I'm sure there's cooperation and positivity with respect to all of these amendments coming forward. All in all, it's been a remarkable day, one where we are in agreement. We've had some questions and hopefully I've been able to answer those. 

Dr Woodruff - Not too remarkable a day.

Mr BARNETT - Well, it's probably not a surprise. We've been here before. We have now improved it since last time and it's great to feel so much goodwill and collaboration here today.

I did want to pass on my sincere thanks. I've mentioned Amber Mignot and Peter Kemper in my office, likewise to Alice Lynch and Bruce Patterson who's not here, and Felicity Poulter who is as well. They've been on this journey for many years, and I know on behalf of the Westbrooks as well they've expressed their gratitude earlier to all of those I've made mention of and indeed the entire team, so I pass that on on behalf of the Westbrooks. Finally I again thank the Westbrooks for being here and hopefully it won't be too much longer. We're staying positive. This is a good step forward. 

I again commend the bill to the House.

SENTENCING AMENDMENT (AGGRAVATING FACTORS) BILL 2025 (No. 41)

Second Reading

Resumed from 10 September 2025 (page 131)

[4.10 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice, Corrections and Rehabilitation) - Thank you again to the Westbrooks.

Deputy Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to wrap up the Sentencing Amendment (Aggravating Factors) Bill 2025. I want to acknowledge my shadow attorney-general and the Leader of the Greens for their indication of support for this bill. This followed the motion in the parliament yesterday which I think showed a good recognition across the parliament of the support for our multicultural community.

I will acknowledge upfront the support in my department from Peter Davis, Felicity Poulter, [inaudible]. I want to say thank you for their support on the way through. It's taken some time and here we are again., back at it.

In summing up, I know as a parliament we want to crack down on crimes motivated by race discrimination and hate so that every Tasmanian can feel safe, included and be the best they can be in a thriving multicultural community. We're an inclusive society, we want to support everybody and certainly as a government we want to crack down on crime through stronger laws and tougher penalties so that our state is the best place it can possibly be.

I would like to thank and acknowledge the work of the Multicultural Council of Tasmania and the former minister Roger Jaensch, member for Braddon, who's not in the Chamber today. He was a wonderful advocate as Minister for Multicultural Affairs and he and I had a number of interactions with the Multicultural Council and had a special session in the parliament downstairs in the reception room when we announced that together with Equality Tasmania and other representatives highlighting the diversity of our community.

I want to specifically thank the Sentencing Advisory Council. Michael O'Farrell and the team do a fantastic job. Michael's the chairman; I know some of you know Michael. The Sentencing Advisory Council does a lot of important work for the government. They do important research. We take very seriously their report and of course it was their report and recommendation which progressed this bill.

I want to acknowledge the Tasmanian Prejudice Related Violence Working Group. The bill will strengthen the ability for the criminal justice system to respond to hateful, prejudicial or targeted offending by including other forms of prejudicial offending beyond racial motivation. As I've said earlier, these include race, ethnicity or nationality, age of the person, religious belief or affiliation, language, gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, sex characteristics, disability and other prescribed attributes that are non-exhaustive, meaning there may be others as well.

I've mentioned some of the stakeholders and I want to do a thank you again for the submissions from Equality Tasmania, Tas CPSS, the Law Society of Tasmania, the Tasmanian Prejudice Related Violence Working Group, the Community Legal Centres Tasmania, Australia's Special Envoy to Combat Anti-Semitism, the Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service and a number of individuals.

I've mentioned the Sentencing Advisory Council but I want to note the council members as well and acknowledge their service and support: Rosalie Martin; Jill Maxwell; Kim Baumeler; Linda Mason SC; Deputy Commissioner Jonathan Higgins APM; Professor Lorena Bartels; Dr Helen Cockburn; Mr Glenn Hay; Ms Rochelle Mainwaring; and Hannah Phillips.

To indicate the importance of the Sentencing Advisory Council I draw to the attention of colleagues in this Chamber that I've asked them to undertake three other reviews. The first is sentencing trends for child sexual abuse offences. Secondly, I've asked them to update research paper no. 6 on sentencing young offenders, and thirdly, a review of life sentences in Tasmania with comparisons looking at interstate. They have important work to do and I thank them for what they do.

The shadow attorney asked a number of questions so I will respond to those firstly and then I'll move to Dr Woodruff's questions. There's a little bit of overlap on the way through. Why have definitions for the attributes not been provided through a link to the terms in the Anti-Discrimination Act? I note that we've received a recommendation from the Tasmanian Prejudice Related Violence Working Group to define attributes in the bill that also appear in the Anti-Discrimination Act.

The Sentencing Act 1997 deals with criminal matters while the Anti-Discrimination Act deals with civil matters, so there's clearly a difference. It is important that these two areas remain separate and that the application of criminal law is not affected by changes to legislation providing civil recourse. I just wanted to draw that to your attention.

Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Can I add to that question? I'm sorry, Attorney, I feel like I'm doing this too often. The question I had around the protected attributes in the Anti-Discrimination Act - and you may be coming to it - was why all of those attributes were not included as potential discrimination motivations for offending, if that makes sense. I understand the difference between civil and criminal, but somebody could be targeted for an assault or a burglary based on their political affiliation, breastfeeding, or some of the other protected attributes in section 16 of the Anti-Discrimination Act that aren't listed as attributes in this bill.

Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice, Corrections and Rehabilitation) - Yes, let me get some advice on that. I think the first response I'd give is that the characteristics I've made mention of before such as age, race, religion, sex and so on are not exclusive but let me see if I can assist the honourable member.

Let me conclude here and then I will come to the additional advice that I have. Definitions have not been included for the terms more generally as the list containing the attributes are illustrative and non-exhaustive, which was the point I mentioned earlier. Attributes direct the court to the type of things that are to be considered without limiting the court to these attributes. Including definitions would be liable to restrict the non-exhaustive list and suggest a hard and fast way in which to interpret the attributes, which is not the intent of the bill. Rather, the government seeks to ensure that the courts can interpret these aggravating factors in a broad manner, as called for by the facts of a particular case. 

That speaks for itself but let me see if I can assist the honourable member further in terms of why the attributes in the bill have been included. The relevant attributes included in the list in sections 11B and BA are largely based on the suggested attributes contained in the recommendations of the SAC report in response to feedback in the public and targeted stakeholder consultation process. The same attributes have been included in both sections 11B and 11BA in the bill. The only exception to this is the relationship between the victim and the offender, which is only relevant to section 11BA. 

Nationality was included on the advice of the Australian Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism, as they provided feedback that inclusion of this attribute would avoid technical difficulties in matters where there is a distinction between race and nationality. Several attributes were amended to make the language of the attributes more consistent with terms found in the Anti-Discrimination Act, so that is an interesting point. Does that address your concerns? Probably the first part of that is probably more direct than the second.

Ms Haddad - It does, thank you, Attorney-General. In part, it does - the part where you explained it is a non-exhaustive list. Obviously, if somebody alleges they have been assaulted because they were breastfeeding, which is a protected attribute under the Anti-Discrimination Act, it is not a protected category under this bill. Similarly, if somebody was assaulted because of their industrial activity or their political affiliation or belief, those are protected attributes under section 16 of the Anti-Discrimination Act but they are not listed in this bill. The fact that it is non-exhaustive and you have made these comments on the Hansard will assist in interpretation if those instances arise in the future.

I was more interested, but I suppose you have answered it too: the SAC review recommended these particular categories of protection. That is fine. However, I would not like to see any other grounds upon which somebody could be criminally offended against excluded from consideration by the court.

Mr BARNETT - Yes. I think at the end of the day, because they are non-exhaustive and there may be others, it is a matter for the court at the time.

Ms Haddad - Thanks. That's okay.

Mr BARNETT - The shadow attorney-general also asked about how data on prejudicial motivation will be collected at the time of the offending, rather than only at sentencing. That was a fair question. The advice I have is that Tasmania Police will educate its members, as per the normal processes that are used when criminal legislation is updated. The Tasmania Police Manual will be updated to ensure that police officers are aware of the need to consider whether there was evidence related to hateful, prejudicial or targeted offending. A training item or a communique will be provided to police as to the new provisions and matters that are to be considered. This will direct police officers to ask certain questions of the victim to prompt them to respond with relevant details that could substantiate the aggravating factors. Guidance on the changes will also be provided to police prosecutors. That is my advice.

There was also a question about what measures will be taken in relation to maintaining data on hateful and/or prejudicial offending. I think Dr Woodruff asked about this as well. The development of appropriate data collection systems will fall within the responsibility of the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management. However, I also note that the Standing Council of Attorneys-General (SCAG) has decided to implement a national hate crimes and incidents database. The manner in which Tasmanian offences involving hatred or prejudice are recorded will be developed so as to be compatible with any national system.  I might just check if we have a timeline on that. No, I don't know, but I am more than happy to keep in touch with the honourable member.  I believe we have a SCAG meeting in November this year. Any time colleagues have queries about that, I am more than happy to respond accordingly.

Dr Woodruff had a number of questions, one of which I believe I covered. Another question related to the second reading debate about stakeholder recommendations and Equality Tasmania. There was a question about how Equality Tasmania recommended that police data systems are reformed to allow evidence for prejudice and hate-related motivation for crimes to be recorded and for professional development for police so that they are able to identify these sorts of motivations. It was covered a little bit in an earlier answer, but there is more to be said. The advice I have, from the Q&A on page 21, is that the development of appropriate data collection systems will fall with the responsibility of Police, Fire and Emergency Management. I have mentioned about SCAG. The work of developing a national hate crimes and incidents database is being progressed by an interjurisdictional working group that will report to the Police Ministers' Council. The next meeting of the Police Ministers' Council is scheduled for 2 October 2025. 

Regarding police education, Tasmania Police will educate its members as per the normal processes that are used when criminal legislation is updated. As I mentioned earlier, the Tasmania Police Manual will be updated to ensure that police officers are aware of the need to consider whether there was evidence related to hateful, prejudicial or targeted offending. A training item or communique will also be provided to police as to the new provisions and matters that are to be considered. This will direct police officers to ask certain questions of the victim to prompt them to respond with relevant details that could substantiate the aggravating factors. Guidance on the changes will also be provided to police prosecutors. Of course, they do a very important job and have an important role.

There was another question about Equality Tasmania, the Tasmanian Council of Social Service (TasCOSS), Community Legal Centres, the Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service and the Tasmanian Prejudice Related Violence Working Group. They recommended investing in an education campaign about the bill. The government will consider options for raising awareness of the effects and implications of prejudicial offending. I thank all of the community organisations who work with our diverse community and already provide support and education around their rights in Tasmania. Building engagement and awareness around hateful offending, and the need to report such conduct, is an important item that is currently being considered at the national level, as I have indicated. 

There was a question about Equality Tasmania's recommended victims of crime compensation for victims of prejudice-motivated mistreatment and targeted violence. Victims of crime compensation is administered under the Victims of Crimes Assistance Act 1976. Compensation may be awarded under the act where a person suffers an injury as a result of another person committing an offence. Independent criminal injuries commissioners determine victims' applications for financial compensation. I note that as the bill considered today relates to the sentencing of proven offences, the Victims of Crime Assistance Act may already apply and will continue to apply following the commencement of the provision of this bill. 

However, I also note that the commissioner may consider relevant background information, such as the aggravating factors provided for by this bill, in cases where the victim is entitled to an award of compensation under the Victims of Crime Assistance Act.

Dr Woodruff asked about the TasCOSS, Community Legal Centres and Tasmanian Prejudice Related Violence Working Group recommendation that police, judicial officers and other key decision-makers are trained in relation to the experience and impact of prejudice and discrimination. Firstly, with respect to Tasmania Police, it will educate its members as per the normal processes used when criminal legislation is updated. The Tasmania Police Manual will be updated, as I mentioned before. A training item or communique will be provided to police as to the new provisions and matters that are to be considered. This will direct police officers to ask certain questions of the victim to prompt them to respond with relevant details that could substantiate the aggravating factors. I believe some thought has been given to all of this to be able to implement this bill sensibly. 

In terms of the judiciary, guidance on the changes will also be provided to police prosecutors. I mentioned their important role a few moments ago. I note that the Director of Public Prosecutions, magistrates and judges operate independently from government and determine their own processes around training and professional development. Judicial officers at the Supreme Court and Magistrates Court currently undertake a variety of training and professional development, and that is important. Examples of this include the Supreme Court providing training for staff to better record evidence provided by children, and a joint training session between the Supreme Court and the Magistrates Court on unconscious bias. I'm aware of some of that training that's been going on and they're doing some good work in that space, both the Supreme Court and the Magistrates Court. Certainly as Attorney-General, I'm pleased about that. There's more to be done. A lot of that has come out of the commission of inquiry, by the way, and there's more work to do there. The government supports the independence of these institutions to design their own forms of training while also recognising that law reforms such as provided for in this bill signal community expectations and values to our judicial officers.

In regard to Dr Woodruff's query about TasCOSS and its recommendation for additional funding for organisations which support individuals and groups who experience harm motivated by prejudice or hatred, so that victims are able to access holistic supports - the government will consider funding for organisations on a case by case basis. I know that we already provide funding and grants to a number of organisations that work with diverse members of our community. I should mention the Solicitors' Guarantee Fund, where some $4.6 million was recently announced for successful applicants. Some of that money is expended for education and awareness and training in terms of getting improved access to justice accordingly.

The Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service and Equality Tasmania recommended perpetrator education and rehabilitation programs for prejudicially motivated offenders. Without detracting from the seriousness of prejudicial offending, the advice I have is that the number of people who engage in prejudicial offending in Tasmania is low. That's obviously acknowledged. The government will assess the benefit of additional or amended perpetrator education rehabilitation programs as evidence around this offending is gathered. I wanted to acknowledge that.

I've received a positive feedback from Mr Croome overnight, and Equality Tasmanian in terms of this legislation. I'll put that on the record. I don't think you would mind me passing that on, in terms of support for our work to date as a parliament and this particular initiative.

In conclusion, thank you again for all of those remarks, and for the support for this bill. This is another step forward with goodwill and collaboration. 

I commend the bill to the House.

GOVERNMENT BUSINESS GOVERNANCE REFORMSBILL 2025 (36 OF 2025)

Second Reading

[4.32 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Treasurer) - Deputy Speaker, this bill is the first of two tranches of legislative reforms to ensure Tasmanian government-owned businesses act in the best long-term interests of Tasmanians. Government business governance reform is of paramount importance to this government and the delivery of vital services together with future prosperity of all Tasmanians.

As part of the government's 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future, a key priority remains growing our economy, which creates and sustains jobs and creates opportunities for future Tasmanians and their families, as well as a competitive environment for business to invest.

In recent years, we have faced significant challenges due to failings in government businesses. That is why our government is undertaking the most comprehensive reform of government business enterprises and state-owned companies in recent years. These are substantial adjustments. We are taking a holistic approach to reform. Our goal is to create a governance framework that is integrated, cost-effective, transparent, and above all, responsive to the need of Tasmanians. The reforms we are implementing will support a more coordinated approach to investment decisions made by our government businesses. They will drive the full potential of economic growth, improved service delivery of those important essential services that underpin our economy and community, maximised economic gains and efficiency improvements which deliver dividends for Tasmanians, and a sustainable future for our government-owned businesses. We are seeking to create a framework that can best serve the needs of Tasmanians in years to come.

This bill takes on board some of the feedback received on the proposed reforms included in the Government Business Governance Reform Draft Plan that we released on 3 November 2024. There were 48 submissions received on the draft plan from business, industry and community stakeholders. We have had business and community working together with the government as we embark on, and continue driving and delivering, these important reforms.

The bill takes into account the feedback received from consultation on the draft bill. The bill has also been developed considering feedback received from the Government Business Reform Industry Reference Group and the government businesses. At the core of the reforms is ensuring the government businesses are making decisions that are in the long-term interests of the owners: the Tasmanian community. At this stage, let me acknowledge that I am moving these reforms on the foundations laid, and the hard work by, my predecessor the Attorney-General, the honourable Guy Barnett MP. 

For government businesses, putting Tasmanians' long-term interests first, which should be a given, means that businesses will be making the right decisions through contemporary governance as well as competent, accountable boards and senior executives. Aligning the businesses' corporate strategy, where appropriate, to the strategic interests of the state is outlined by shareholding ministers delivering on any community service obligations assigned to it by government. These legislative reforms are just one step in the government's broader reform package for government businesses.

In addition to this bill, the government will implement a suite of reforms, including further amendments to legislation and updates to other elements of the governance framework, such as formal policies and guidelines. The governance reforms are being guided by the following principles:

ensuring that all government businesses place the interests of Tasmania first and are accountable for doing so;

improving governance for government businesses to ensure it is effective, contemporary, fit for purpose, transparent, and provides for appropriate oversight;

expanding the range of performance-monitoring options available to shareholding ministers; and

incorporating appropriate levers in the governance framework to manage or rectify poor performance of government businesses if required, including in relation to major capital projects.

This bill is focused on the first two principles: accountability for placing Tasmania first and improving governance. The commitment to ensuring that government businesses are putting the long-term interest of Tasmanians first will be delivered through the new joint legislative direction power for shareholding ministers included in this bill. This will be supported by an enhanced and more transparent framework when government requires a business to undertake community service obligations, a reform to be included in the second bill. 

These reforms, combined with the existing ability for shareholding ministers to set out expectations in the ministerial charter and statement of expectations, will provide the ability for shareholding ministers to clearly and transparently articulate what is expected from each government business. All government businesses will need to demonstrate that they are putting Tasmanians first through the performance targets set, and reported against, in the annual statement of corporate intent. This bill includes the approval process and expectations in relation to the statement of corporate intent, including the requirement that it be made public on the website of the government business.

The bill also includes a requirement for all government businesses to publicly release a half-yearly progress report. This report will be required to be released on the website of the government business by 28 February each year. This bill makes it clear that the government expects the shareholding ministers will be kept appropriately informed by the board of a government business if there are adverse circumstances impacting it.

This is to ensure the shareholding ministers can more meaningfully fulfil their role as representative of the owners on behalf of the Tasmanian community and take appropriate action if necessary. This bill includes a requirement that the two shareholding minister roles cannot be undertaken by the same person, with an exception allowed for the Tasmanian Public Finance Corporation. This was already a legislative requirement for some state-owned companies and is an important element of the government model.

Can I also note at this stage that there was no formal second ministry in the past, because the act didn't require it. I salute former treasurer Ferguson for his adoption of the best-practice initiative of inviting other ministers and senior advisors from other offices. This will now be formalised. The best practice that Minister Ferguson undertook will now be legislated.

Under the current framework, all government businesses except the Tasmanian Public Finance Corporation are required to have two shareholding ministers: the treasurer and the portfolio minister. This is because the Government Business Enterprises Act 1995 currently defines the portfolio minister as the minister to whom the administration of that enactment or part is assigned through an administrative arrangements order. This bill requires that if the treasurer and portfolio minister are the same person, the treasurer must nominate another minister as portfolio minister. For the Tasmanian Public Finance Corporation, the treasurer may nominate another minister as portfolio minister. 

From a governance perspective, we know that the boards set the tone from the top and can influence the culture of the entire organisation. We therefore need to ensure that we have the right board for each government business. To ensure that there is appropriate board renewal, this bill includes a limit of two full terms for directors and chairs of government businesses, unless approved due to exceptional circumstances.

Any additional terms approved beyond the limit will need to be made transparent, including a requirement to table a notice in both Houses of parliament within seven sitting days, including the reasons for the extension. The bill does not prevent the chair being appointed for another term; it will just require an additional layer of transparency when this occurs.

As part of the reforms, the board selection processes and guidelines will also be updated to ensure that there is more focus on appointing directors who understand the business needs in a Tasmanian context. Going forward, there will be reforms to the board performance evaluation framework for government businesses. In this regard, we have sought independent expert advice on best-practice board evaluation, including the evaluation process, what should be covered in an evaluation, the frequency of evaluations and benchmarks for assessing and comparing board performance. This advice will form the basis for the new government business board performance evaluation framework, to ensure Tasmania has a nation-leading board evaluation framework for our government businesses.

The bill also includes a requirement for all government businesses to establish and publicly release a sponsorship framework that complies with Treasurer's instructions and any regulations issued. The reforms will also provide more options to shareholding ministers to monitor performance and, if there are any concerns, the ability for shareholding ministers to request further advice from independent experts or to implement other measures to support a business to get back on track.

It is intended that these are measures that would only be invoked if there are concerns or exceptional circumstances. The legislative elements of these reforms will be included in the next bill. We recognise that these are only the start of the reforms to the governance framework for government business. We are intending to release the second tranche of legislation for consultation in the coming months to provide the opportunity for stakeholders to provide feedback.

Collectively, our government businesses constitute a significant portion of the Tasmanian economy. Government businesses employ over 5200 people and in the 23-24 financial year contributed $374 million in returns to government, representing 4.4 per cent of state revenue.

Government businesses also directly provide some of the state's most important economic infrastructure and deliver essential services to the Tasmanian community. They manage assets valued at more than $27 billion and the forecasting to invest $7.5 billion into infrastructure projects over the four years from 2025-26. The strategic directions and investment by these businesses also support private sector investment in the state and play a fundamental role in its economic development and job creation.

The performance and accountability of our government businesses is, therefore, critical. These reforms are about ensuring the government businesses are making decisions that are in the long-term interests of its owners, the Tasmanian people.

We need a more robust framework, but at the same time it needs to be agile to ensure it can adapt to the opportunities and challenges that are over the horizon for our government businesses. I commend the bill to the House.

[4.46 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin) - Deputy Speaker, I would state from the outset that these changes are very sensible. In fact, the sort of changes you wonder why they were not there in the first place. I was just listening to the second reading speech outlining the four principles being ensuring government businesses place the interests of Tasmania first and are accountable for doing so. It is pretty good, pretty sensible.

Improving governance for government businesses to ensure it's effective, contemporary, fit for purpose, transparent and provides an appropriate oversight [inaudible] expanding the range of performance monitoring options available for shareholding ministers and for incorporating appropriate levers in the governance framework to manage or rectify poor performance of government businesses, if required, including in relation to major capital projects.

The elephant in the room in the bill is the TT-Line ferry fiasco, which is not specifically mentioned here, but I was pleased to see in the opening remarks in the second reading speech talking about the issues that have inspired these changes. There are certainly issues that dominated political discourse last calendar year; issues that Labor responded to back in October last year when we announced the first stage of what we thought was a good approach, which was to modernise the legislative framework for our government businesses, including replacing the 30-year-old Business Enterprise Act. Make it law that government businesses are acting in the best long-term interests of Tasmania.

Three, reduce the confusion caused by the Corporations Act by requiring government business portfolios to ensure they are appropriately classified as GBEs or SOCs with a view to optimising governance models to prevent the failures we have seen on the honourable Michael Ferguson, former Treasurer watch again by requiring that at all times there are two separate shareholder ministers for all government businesses and five, bring in fresh ideas and new leadership by setting a two-term limit for board members in a strict rule that people cannot serve on more than two government boards at once - a similar set of reforms to what the government announced in its draft some weeks later and then we stand here today debating. 

I open by saying this is sensible and we support the intent. Obviously, something had to change because we have seen the biggest infrastructure stuff up in Tasmania's history. It was caused by government businesses that were not acting in Tasmania's best interest, were not accountable to ministers, were not accountable to Tasmanians, and possibly, worst of all, were not actually working together in the best interest of the state - that being TasPorts and TT-Line.

The evidence that we heard in parliamentary committees - I think it was the Public Accounts Committee primarily, but also through Estimates and GBE hearings around these government businesses pointing the finger at each other, not taking responsibility, although I have to say at this point Damian Bugg - I thought the former acting chair, gave a very good account of himself at GBE hearings last year when he outlined and took responsibility, which was something we were looking for. That was in stark contrast to TasPorts, which sat in the same chair in front of me and took no responsibility at all. 

Responsibility needs to be spread across both of those businesses and also through ministers. Ultimately, the former minister for infrastructure and treasurer, through responsibility, resigned from the portfolios, which was appropriate to do and resigned before it was foreshadowed that this place was likely to lose confidence in him to continue in that role because of these stuff-ups.

One of the key changes here is the requirement that we have two shareholder ministers in place so that there is not just a single minister overseeing a major project, as was the case for more than a year where the former minister, Mr Ferguson, had full oversight of the project and of those businesses with no other shareholder minister, which is clearly a problem in terms of oversight and something that needed to change.

There was no appropriate accountability for the board. It still staggered that Mr Grainger was eventually - I am not sure of the technical term - he certainly left his position. That was on the afternoon or evening where he issued a statement and said he was going to set the record straight. The government did not act to remove him from the role until he threatened to go public and say what he wanted to say.  Performance should have led to changes at TT-Line rather than someone threatening to say what they thought. 

I do not think there is anyone - certainly at TT-Line - who would not say that huge mistakes were made there, but it is important that the Public Accounts Committee was eventually able to hear the evidence from Mr Grainger, Mr Dwyer and from a range of people who were involved in the project to outline to understand exactly what went wrong with it.  That stuff-up is costing our economy half-a-billion dollars every year, according to the Eslake report. If you take the Eslake report and put the dollar terms into real terms, over the course of a five-year period it will cost around $2.5 billion from Tasmania's economy and lose additional freight and tourism movements.

This has a real and marked impact on Tasmania's economy. Then of course, there are the cost blowouts. The blowouts at Berth 3, extreme blowouts, you would have to say, and the bailout. The cost blowouts - more than half-a-billion dollars. That gets hit on Tasmania's budgets through its government businesses, of course. They are significant costs that impact Tasmania's budget and have now led to the situation we are in, which is TT-Line being given an additional line of credit, increased borrowing limit, with what must be an inevitable bailout coming from this interim budget coming forward, because something has to give.

The government is saying on the one hand that fares will not go up but if fares are not going up and you have this huge debt burden falling onto that government business, then something has to give, which is a bailout, increased fares or increased debt. That company is under serious stress right now. Tasmania's flagship tourism business is under serious stress because of the mismanagement of those government businesses, including TasPorts and TT-Line, but also government ministers that did not do their job. That is why these reforms are important.

I will go to the first part of the controversy that came out last year, which is the bailout from TT-Line to Rauma Marine Constructions (RMC). We discovered, after the 2024 election, that a secret bailout had been given to RMC. The very first question that we asked in 2024 in this place was to the Premier about whether there had been a bailout to RMC by TT-Line. To this day I do not know, but I suspect he didn't know that $80 million of Tasmanian taxpayer money had been transferred to RMC to bail it out. No one knew. It was kept secret from Tasmanians, apparently kept secret from the Premier, all during caretaker mode. 

We had the former treasurer who said he was in constant contact with then-chair Mike Grainger. We had a briefing to the Labor opposition but did not seek agreement for and did not talk about the $80 million bailout during caretaker mode. Quite extraordinary. By asking questions, we eventually obtained the information that there was an $80 million bailout from TT- Line to RMC. Incredibly now, TT-Line itself is going to end up needing to be bailed out by Tasmanian taxpayers.

It is incredible that that was allowed to happen. It appeared as though no one knew. It appeared as though Tasmanians were never going to know. When I opened the TT-Line annual report for 2023-24, I looked from start to finish for the bailout in the report. I opened it up online and did the Ctrl+F to see if I could find this. It was not explicitly outlined anywhere in the annual report. Wouldn't you think that would be a big deal that we have had to give an $80 million bailout to the people building our new ships? It was nowhere. Despite it being public by the time the annual report was published, it still wasn't reported. 

That is why I am pleased to see in this bill today, to give credit to the government, that six-monthly reporting and, I believe, now the requirement, or at least an expectation - hopefully a requirement, that in that circumstance, TT-Line would need to disclose as soon as possible a bailout like that. Perhaps, I will phrase it as a question to the Treasurer when he comes back. Is it the case that TT-Line, in their annual report or six-monthly reporting under this legislation, would need disclose a large bailout sum like the $80 million? 

The other component of this is the response to the TT-Line ferries fiasco, the statement in the state of the state address earlier this year which said that the TT-Line ferries fiasco had caused the government to reflect on the nature of public ownership. There were two commitments they made. The first was this bill, which we support, and the second was, 'Actually, also we might just sell them.' It was the first government in Tasmanian history that did not know how to run government businesses, so its response was, 'Well, I know what we will do: we will just sell them.' The wrong response, a response Tasmanians were shocked by and did not support, and thankfully the government has abandoned, at least for now. 

We heard this morning that the Premier believes in the private sector again. He believed in the private sector back in April. He didn't when yesterday's bill went through. Today he believes in it again. This government is not exactly driven by ideology, let's face it. It is driven by a quest to stay there.  Survival. Who knows what they will think of next. However, the response of selling the assets was not the right response. The response, to the government's credit, of adjusting and modernising governance is a good response. This is tranche 1, as I understand it, as outlined in the second reading speech. I believe there is much more to do, but this is a good start.

Of course, this has not been the only government business stuff-up we have seen. Perhaps even more damaging to our economy has been Hydro Tasmania. I have the member for Lyons here, Mr Mitchell -

Mr Mitchell - Boyer.

Mr WINTER - who has just said the words I was about to, which is Boyer. Oh my, what a complete stuff-up this is. We have one of Tasmania's great intergenerational employers in the Derwent Valley, the Boyer paper mill, the only paper mill still surviving in this country, one of the only paper mills surviving in the southern hemisphere. It wants to convert from coal, which it now needs to ship in from New South Wales by boat, by train and by truck. However, it can't convert to electricity in Tasmania because Hydro says there is no power available at any cost in Tasmania. Extraordinary stuff. Boyer can't get power. 

Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest arrived in Tasmania in late 2021, early 2022. He went to see then-premier Peter Gutwein and said, 'I want to start a hydrogen plant at Bell Bay. I'm going to employ a few hundred people. I have this huge ambition for the state. I want Tasmania to be at the forefront of my investments into hydrogen'. He was told there was no power available at any price. The government imagined it would create this hub by adding more and more hydrogen into Bell Bay through businesses like Woodside and Origin, and they left because there was no power available at any price.

Hydro Tasmania has been attempted to be fixed by the ministerial directive. The information and concerns that get raised with me, particularly by the ownership of Boyer, is that that has not drastically changed their approach to things. We need to get more power into the grid. Tasmania is the home of renewable energy, or at least it should be. We used to be number one. Now we're number two thanks to South Australia's investments in renewable energy. 

We need to get this right. We need to ensure that all government businesses place Tasmania first and are accountable for doing so, which is in the first principle. We support that, but it is not what the government has been doing, it is not what its businesses have been doing for so long. 

It's not just that though. There's obviously Metro. Metro Tasmania still has temporary service closures. Temporary? They have been three years so far; more than 100 services still temporarily closed. There will be kids who will get all the way through school and their school bus will still be temporarily closed. Again, a failure of governance, a failure of the way that this government has run government businesses. We sincerely hope this bill will improve the way these businesses are run.

We do support the bill. This is important reform. It doesn't go all the way to solving all of the problems, but it is a good start. It is in line with the policy we outlined in October last year. I commend the bill to the House. 

[5.02 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the Treasurer for his second reading speech. The Greens will be supporting this bill. I thank departmental staff for the briefings, two briefings now on this bill. That has been very useful as elements of this bill are complicated. As I go through and articulate our support for this bill, I will be seeking some clarifications from the Treasurer.

The origins of this bill are from some fundamental failures in governance and oversight of government businesses. The minister's points laying out the importance of government businesses to us as Tasmanians are absolutely right. They deliver a whole raft of different services and inputs into our economy that are really important. It's welcome to hear that this is just the start of the reform; that there will be subsequent bills that will be consulted on and address outstanding issues. 

While these reforms are welcome, they won't stop bad decisions being made where they are bad decisions that are endorsed by the government. We have recently seen, from the Greens' perspective, a number of different bad decisions being made. Marinus Link is a perfect example, whereby there are myriad red flags that are in the whole estate business case that are articulating problems and challenges that the government should have seen, that were effectively pushed in there and written by Treasury. They are red flags that are not being flown by the government businesses. This is not a catch-all and it doesn't address bad decisions that are being pushed by government businesses that are endorsed by government. While not a government business, it is a government entity.  I put on the record that the Macquarie Point Stadium is in that space.

That being said, and without casting any aspersions on the bill, I also respectfully suggest to the Treasurer that the claim that this bill is of, and, I quote, 'paramount importance to the future prosperity of all Tasmanians' is perhaps slightly overstating the impact of the bill, somewhat.

The bill introduces a requirement that if two shareholder ministers of a government business are the same person, another minister is selected as the second minister - with the exception of TASCORP where the minister may, but is not required to, nominate a second shareholder minister. The Greens are broadly supportive of this. However, experience tells us that more oversight for a GBE is certainly not a bad thing. I won't go into the level of detail that the shadow treasurer has regarding some of the past failures, but more oversight is clearly going to be a good thing.

We assume that TASCORP has been treated differently because it is the only GBE, I believe, where the Treasurer is the only portfolio minister. However, I would like the Treasurer to outline the rationale for this distinction. For all the other GBEs, there's a requirement for a second shareholder minister to be selected where there is no relevant portfolio. Why is TASCORP any different? It's not clear to me why it would be the case that it has been determined that if a minister is both the Treasurer and the relevant portfolio minister, one person should not be the shareholder minister for both, whereas when the Treasurer is the only portfolio minister, it is okay for there to only be one shareholder minister. The rationale for the reform seems to be that there should be two accountable ministers, regardless of portfolio relevance - to offer essentially a check and balance, a second set of eyes. It's not clear why this principle would not be relevant to TASCORP, other than perhaps that TASCORP has presumably always only had one responsible shareholder minister.

The bill also allows ministers to issue directions to GBEs and state-owned companies. These directions must be tabled unless the board requests the directions not be tabled on grounds of damage to the company, provision of unreasonable advantage, prejudicing an investigation, or it would be a breach of confidentiality. In such an event a statement that a direction has been given must still be tabled. On face value these provisions seem to fairly balance transparency with genuine public interest in non-disclosure. However, the Right to Information Act 2009 also on its face provides this fair balance. The practice of these sorts of things when there is no meaningful check and balance can often differ from a fair reading of the legislation.

My question, Treasurer, is what sort of process, if any, would be available to dispute the grounds on which directions are not tabled? Would Solicitor-General advice be required to confirm that is appropriate?

I also note that one GBE requested an amendment to ensure a GBE's obligations to comply with the direction are paused if a GBE has lodged a valid objection. Please correct me if I'm mistaken, but it appears that this has not been adopted. Their suggested amendment seems quite reasonable, particularly if the GBE believes that the direction would undermine or be contrary to another obligation they have. If you can, would you be able to respond to this concern, please, Treasurer?

The bill also requires that the board must advise the shareholder ministers of progress against the direction at set intervals. Is there a reason that these updates are not required to be tabled?

The bill also includes a requirement to develop a statement of corporate intent for each financial year, as well as a requirement to make a report to shareholder ministers on the first six months of each financial year. This report must also be published online and is subject to the same exemptions available in respect of directions. Again, these are sensible and supportable measures, notwithstanding my previous comments regarding direction exemptions. 

Speaker, the bill does include a requirement on GBEs to notify shareholder ministers of adverse circumstances. This is obviously reasonable and welcome. However, there is again no requirement to provide an update to parliament. The Greens' experience of scandals involving GBEs in this place is generally that there is not a failure of GBEs to notify the government, but a failure of the government to pass that information on to the public and to the parliament. Treasurer, what's your argument for not requiring this information to be made available to the parliament, accepting of course that the nature of some information may not be appropriate to be made public? 

The bill also includes a requirement to develop and make public sponsorship frameworks in accordance with treasurer's instructions. I'm curious to understand the genesis of this amendment. Have there been poor decisions made about sponsorships in the past that this is attempting to curtail and address, or is this an attempt to influence GBEs to provide sponsorships to organisations that the government has an interest in seeing receive a sponsorship? Metro Tasmanian in this regard raised some interesting concerns and reasonable matters in their submission. To quote them:

In the development of the Treasury instructions or guidelines to support this legislative amendment, the government may like to consider setting thresholds for certain requirements to ensure efficient use of resources and decision-making. This will avoid relatively low-value support that is provided, for example, to community-based organisations being tied up in unnecessary red tape. Additionally, it would be helpful to provide clarity as to whether the scope of the instruction is intended to cover financial contributions only, or whether it includes the provision of value in kind, and if so, how that is determined.

I note the Public Trustee also recommended a materiality threshold be adopted in the instruction and Tasmanian Irrigation made a similar recommendation; are you able to outline your thoughts on their comments, and how the Treasurer's instruction in relation to sponsorships would be intended to address these matters?

Finally, the bill provides a prohibition on a person being appointed as a director if they have served two terms or previously served as a CEO, except in extenuating circumstances. The rationale of renewal does have merit. However, it must be acknowledged that terms, for those GBEs governed by the Government Business Enterprises Act 1995 at least, are a maximum of three years. This is an effective limit of six years at the maximum. It would seem to be a waste for an effective director to be limited to six years if they are the best for the job and they are performing appropriately.

I note that STT and TasNetworks recommended a three-term threshold, whereas Tasmanian Irrigation noted they already in practice have two-year limits. What is the government's rationale for a two-term limit over, for example, a three-year one?

That concludes my contribution to the bill. I look forward to the Treasurer's response to the questions that I have raised, and I obviously also welcome the government's approach to reforming government business governance. It is overdue; it is needed and history in this place in recent times, and in times further past, has demonstrated there have been significant failures and those failures need to be addressed. It's welcome that there has been a process to identify and analyse them and come up with a range of reforms that are being introduced in this Bill as has been outlined, the first tranche of those reforms.


The DEPUTY SPEAKER - Thank you. Are there any speakers to the bill? If not, Honourable Treasurer, would you like to sum up?

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Treasurer) - Deputy Speaker, I thank the two members for the contributions to this debate and the support of the Labor opposition and the Greens is appreciated. I look forward to the carriage of this legislation, hopefully still today. I will make a few comments in relation to the contribution of the shadow Treasurer. I fully endorse his commentary in relation to Mr Bugg and his performances at the Public Accounts Committee. I've thanked him publicly for stepping in as the interim chair in exceptionally difficult circumstances. I was a complete newbie in this place, and a fresh minister in transport, confronted with a situation. I have publicly thanked Mr Bugg and I do so again, and echo Mr Winter's commentary.

Unfortunately, I can't quite do that in relation to his commentary about my friend and colleague, Mr Ferguson. Mr Ferguson was cognisant of the issue that Mr Winter raised, but as a result had another minister there and staff from other offices as well to ensure that he was not the only set of eyes. It was not legislated, it was not required and that is what Mr Ferguson did. 

In relation to the former chair of TT-Line saying that he was dismissed for 'threatening', or whatever Mr Winter's terminology was, to set the record straight, let's be very clear: the Premier had just spoken to a broad range of people in freight, logistics, tourism, et cetera, with TT-Line and TasPorts. The Premier had said, 'The blame game has to stop, we've got to work together to get the outcome needed.' That very afternoon, the statement was made that the former chair was looking forward to setting the record straight, completely obviating or, in effect, repudiating the Premier's statement about moving forward. That is why I sought to make the phone call and then sent Mr Grainger an email and he then resigned later that day.

That said, can I move on to the commentary about Berth 3 and the costs blowout in relation to the construction of Berth 3. If you simply look at the figures, there is no doubt, from $90 million to a figure of about $490 million now - in fairness, I say to the shadow treasurer and every single person who knows anything about construction of a berth, nobody, with respect, who had any understanding of the task ahead, could ever have thought or asserted to government that you could have done that job for $90 million.

Mr Winter - But it was the government's position for years that it was going to cost $90 million.

Mr ABETZ - I take the interjection from the shadow treasurer. That was based on the advice provided from people whose advice, I will be polite, was suboptimal. When it was properly looked at, we then had the figure. It's yet another example of the longer you delay a project, nearly always there will be a higher cost. That said, the TT-Line let down the people of Tasmania exceptionally badly in relation to the Berth 3 situation in Devonport. This is something which I have monitored very closely. I hope I don't jinx the project. I have every confidence in the new board of TT-Line - the new CEO, Chris Carbone, doing a fantastic job, and Mr Paul Kirkwood, who is the project manager. The new board, the new CEO and the new project manager are just doing a fantastic job.

I was up there the other day and over 20 of the - I believe it's 27 piles that need to be driven - have now been driven, so the project is well and truly under way. I refer to Mr Winter's 
commentary about the $80 million bailout, it was a commercial decision. Whilst I have been, I believe, rightly critical of the former TT-Line board in relation to its management or lack of management - and when I say board, also the CEO of TT-Line, their lack of management of Berth 3, the decision to pay RMC an extra $80 million was the right commercial decision in all the circumstances. When you have a failing shipbuilding company, you have a choice. You can say, 'Fine, we walk away from the contract, and we will start afresh somewhere else.' That would have delayed the new Spirits even further, number one. 

Number two, even more importantly, and this is, I think, the main basis of their decision and why I supported it: sniffing around the market, and that's not a technical term, but in checking out the market, it was determined that to start from scratch again, the cost of a new contract would be more than the $80 million they were paying to RMC. The reason for that, part and parcel of that, was the shelling of the Ukrainian steel mill. There are only about three steel mills in the world that make the specialist steel for shipping. Our friend Mr Putin ensured that there was a shortage of that steel, and the costs increased substantially. The question then was, do you persist with what you've got? To the great credit, the board and CEO were able to obtain the Finnish government's underwriting that in the event that there was more than $80 million required, the Finnish taxpayer would come in to ensure that the Spirits were completed.

The TT-Line had to move exceptionally quickly at the time. I fully agree with Mr Winter that they should have reported it to the government. They made the decision during caretaker and we only found out after the event. In life, sometimes you are not given a choice between perfect and imperfect; you are given choices which are both unpalatable, but one is less unpalatable than the other. The decision for what's been called a bailout by Mr Winter was, in fact, a good smart commercial decision in all the circumstances.

Mr Winter - The question I asked the Treasurer was whether that would now be required to be reported in the annual report.

Mr ABETZ - Yes. I was just looking at the notes I scribbled down. Sometimes I think I would be qualified to be a doctor in relation to my handwriting. Sorry, Professor Razay, and I've never seen your handwriting. 

In relation to continuous reporting, matters of that nature would be required to be reported to the government and then in their six-monthly statements and reports. I trust I have dealt with the issues that you have raised, Mr Winter.

I will turn to Mr Bayley and, somewhat tongue in cheek, say that to be accused of engaging in hyperbole would be something I would take seriously apart from the fact it comes from the Greens. I must say in fairness that the Greens are quite well noted for their excessive hyperbole. Possibly that's why you recognised it when I may have engaged in it myself. That aside, the member for Clark, Mr Bayley, asked me about why there is a special arrangement for the Tasmanian Public Finance Corporation (TASCORP). The portfolio act for TASCORP is allocated to the Treasurer due to the activities that TASCORP performs on behalf of the state. The Treasurer has, therefore, been historically fulfilling the roles under the Government Business Enterprises Act of Treasurer and the portfolio minister/Treasurer within the same role. It is not considered that this arrangement has the same potential conflict and need for matters to be considered from different perspectives as may arise if the circumstance is due to one person making decisions in their capacity under two different roles.

In relation to the process of a tabling Treasurer's directions, there may be circumstances such as matters that are commercial-in-confidence that would mitigate against the tabling of the direction. In those circumstances, a statement needs to be tabled as to what it is about in general terms, so there is the transparency and advice provided that something has occurred that is not being hidden other than for the fact that there may be something of a commercial-in-confidence nature about the matter.

Mr Bayley - Is that the Solicitor-General's advice? Is that what you are referring to there? Or is it advice from the government business?

Mr ABETZ - That would be the advice from the GBE and the Treasurer as to whether that would be an appropriate thing to do. It's a judgment call at the end of the day. We do have the mechanisms of RTI motions from this House, examination at the GBE scrutiny, et cetera. Notification of that will be made available and, as a result, MPs that might want a private briefing would undoubtedly be provided with that on a confidential basis to ensure that the commercial-in-confidence aspects, or whatever other aspect, would be protected.

In relation to the issue of sponsorship, I am advised that that was raised, in fact, by the private sector in the round tables that were held, and it arose from the JackJumpers. I have only seen one game, much to my shame, but if you do go to a JackJumpers game at the Derwent Entertainment Centre (DEC), oh, what's it called now?

Mr Mitchell - MyState Arena.

Mr ABETZ - MyState Arena. That shows my age by still referring to it as the DEC. But anyway, at My State Arena, you cannot help but notice a fair degree of government business enterprise sponsorship there. The view was that the GBEs were potentially crowding out the opportunity of the private sector. That was, if you like, a private sector initiative that arose out of the discussions.

Mr Bayley - Treasurer, there was another question there you might have missed when you were talking to your advisers in relation to progress against a direction. The bill requires that the board must advise the shareholder ministers of progress against the direction it has issued. There was a question I had there around why that isn't to be tabled. Or is there a requirement that that progress report is to be tabled?

Mr ABETZ - There is the requirement of continuous reporting by the GBE or SOC (state-owned company) to the minister and then the six-monthly reports of the GBE or SOC would then pick that up, as I understand it. The parliament would then be informed in relation to that progress.

Mr BAYLEY - So, the six-monthly and annual reporting would explicitly address each or any direction that has been given by a minister?

Mr ABETZ - The progress against it, yes. 

Then finally, your commentary about effective directors not being allowed to serve for more than six years, I take that. As a general rule, renewal, et cetera, is seen to be a good thing. However, there is an exception that those terms can be extended, but if they are extended, a statement of reasons, exactly, Mr Bayley, has to be tabled in this place.

I don't think we would want to cut off our nose to spite our face, or whatever the terminology is. If there is an exceptional director, it's clearly within the interests of Tasmania and Tasmanians to have that director continuing to serve. However, in support of that, a statement about the exceptionality of that particular director would need to be tabled. 

Honourable Speaker, with that, I believe I have dealt with the issues raised by the honourable shadow treasurer and the Greens treasury spokesman. 

I commend the bill to the House.

ADJOURNMENT

[5.31 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of Government Business) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House do now adjourn. 


Charlie Kirk - Political Assassination in the US

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of Government Business) - Honourable Speaker, usually I'm reading out answers, but today I'm not. 

I thought I would rise this evening to speak on the terrible events that occurred earlier today, local time, in Utah. I am of course speaking of the murder of a well-known conservative commentator and founder of the youth organisation Turning Point USA. Charlie was murdered, a political assassination, according to American authorities, by an as-yet-uncaught shooter while doing what he did best:  courageously standing up for faith, family and country.  Tragically, he leaves behind a wife and family, a three-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son. 

Charlie, Charles James Kirk, was born on 14 October 1993 in Chicago. His mother was a mental health nurse and his father an architect. Charlie's political activism started early, creating campaigns at his local school, including one to reverse a price increase for cookies. 

Charlie, with associate Bill Montgomery, founded Turning Point USA in 2012, heading it until his murder today. Turning Point USA advocated for conservative ideas and policies on high school, college, and university campuses across the United States. Charlie was persuasive and provocative, building a huge online following that went well into the millions. Charlie was no stranger to controversy, but forthrightly and openly argued the case for conservatism at college campuses across the United States. Setting himself up on a chair in the heart of America's most liberal centres of higher education, he would challenge students to debate him on any topic they chose. Nothing was off the agenda, particularly the sacred cows of the political left.

Charlie argued persuasively for the family and for the unborn, for the fundamental freedoms which have defined the West, for free markets and economic prosperity, for the rule of the people, for the rule of law, and for the Christian faith. He was dedicated to dialogue. His often repeated byline was, 'When talking stops, violence starts'.

Sadly, despite his best efforts, violence has cut short his life today and his talking. His death has rightly been condemned across the political spectrum. Gavin Newsom, Democratic governor of California, said:

The attack on Charlie Kirk is disgusting, violent, reprehensible. In the United States of America, we must reject political violence in every form.

Barack Obama condemned political violence as 'despicable' and said it had no place in our democracy.

Kamala Harris said she was:

… deeply disturbed … Let me be clear, political violence has no place in America. I condemn this act and we all must work together to ensure this does not lead to more violence.

Hakeem Jeffries, the Democrat House Minority Leader:

Political violence of any kind and against any individual is unacceptable and completely incompatible with American values.

Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister of Great Britain:

My thoughts this evening are with the loved ones of Charlie Kirk. It is heartbreaking that a young family has been robbed of a father and a husband. We must all be free to debate openly and freely without fear. There can be no justification for political violence. 

At the heart of the Liberal Party's beliefs, we condemn the autocracies of fascism and communism and extremism. May Charlie Kirk rest in peace.


Mental Health Support

[5.36 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I hope that I get through this in five minutes, but I might ask for indulgence of the House to extend the time because I have people here listening, but I will try to get through it.

I rise this this evening on 'R U OK Day' to tell the harrowing story of a constituent and those who advocate on his behalf. We talk a lot in this place about healthcare, the housing crisis, the broken hospital system, the lack of medical professionals, and the need for increased care. 

This evening I want to talk about the very real struggle of a son, a brother, a young man roughly the same age as my sons. As a child, Jake was bright, good at school and described as a 'golden boy' by his teachers. As a young man, he had a passion for music and a bright future in the music industry, but with complex mental health challenges, the odds are firmly stacked against Jake.

Over the past few months, I've been honoured to meet Erica again. I used to work with Erica, who is here tonight with her family; a mother, healthcare professional and tireless advocate for her son, Jake, who has experienced mental health illness for over 16 years. Since he was 17, Jake has seen nearly 50 psychiatrists, been hospitalised for psychotic episodes on multiple occasions, and despite being desperately in need of care, was booted out of hospital because, like so many others, there are not enough beds or resources to support him. 

Due to this fractured system, Jake has found himself homeless, living in inappropriate accommodation: at one stage a backpackers. Jake is on the NDIS and unable to work. He is reliant on support workers to perform everyday tasks.

On one admission to hospital, Jake waited for four days in the emergency department. Then he was meant to be reviewed by a psychiatrist on Friday, who finished up at the Royal on the Sunday. At every admission, his parents have to explain Jake's situation each time, which is absolutely exhausting. This fragmentation of his care - and there's no blame, by the way, on health professionals or anybody in this system, it's just the system. This fragmentation of his care has taken 16 years to get a correct diagnosis of bipolar disorder with psychotic features.

Jake is just one of 5000 Tasmanians on the social housing wait list and despite being on the priority wait list for more than three-and-a-half years, no suitable property has been found. His parents are beside themselves, disheartened by the health and housing systems, and in constant fear for his safety. After 16 years of begging for appropriate care, they are burnt out due to compounding stress. Meanwhile, Jake feels hopeless, is sleeping rough and feels betrayed by the systems that were designed to support him.

Honourable Speaker, what kind of story is this? What kind of society are we if we can't even care for the most vulnerable?  Imagine how different Jake's life could have been if he had appropriate mental health care from the start. If he could see just one psychiatrist rather than 48, who could work with his family to treat his illness. If he could have stayed in hospital when he was admitted. That he was offered a house as soon as he applied and paired with the support worker who could help find a job.

I have shared Jake's story today. His is a story emblematic of so many people who are homeless, who are locked out of the housing system, who struggle with mental illness. It's the fault of the problems. These are not things that happen to a minority of Tasmanians. They are common issues. Five thousand Tasmanians languish on the housing wait list and 2000 Tasmanians are homeless. More than 88,000 Tasmanians experience mental illness. That's one in five Tasmanians. 

These are not uncommon problems. They are systemic and systemic problems need systemic solutions.  If we want to solve such issues for Jake and his family, we need to work together. That's what I invite everyone in this 52nd Parliament to do.


Charlie Kirk - Political Assassination in the US

[5.41 p.m.]
Mr MITCHELL (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I wanted to associate myself with the remarks of the Treasurer in his adjournment speech. The assassination and murder of Charlie Kirk today sent shock waves through the entire world. You wouldn't find anybody perhaps more diametrically opposed to many of the things that Charlie Kirk espoused than myself, and we come from very different sides of the political spectrum. 

One thing that Charlie Kirk was famous for was that he used words to express his views, and he did respectfully. He went out to campuses, and he used ideas to make his arguments. He used words, didn't use violence, didn't incite violence, and didn't use crass populism. He was in many ways, for those of us in the centre left, one of our worst nightmares. He was very persuasive, particularly amongst young men in making them the conservative cause, and he did it by expressing ideas.

There is no place at all for political violence of any kind, and particularly not of the most egregious kind that we've seen today happen in the United States of America.  There's no place for it. I condemn it absolutely without reservation, and I'm sure my colleagues do too. I just wanted to say that I felt the heartfelt emotion of the Treasurer in his speech. I know he feels this very deeply and I stand with him on this. 


Charlie Kirk - Political Assassination in the US

Mr Di FALCO (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I concur with the comments of minister Abetz. We've lost the voice of reason. My thoughts are with Charlie Kirk's family. Thank you.


TasTAFE Graduation

Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Skills and Jobs) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to celebrate the graduation of many TasTAFE students, from a whole range of different vocational courses, who are going to change the lives of Tasmanians. Whether they're people who are building our homes, caring for our loved ones, or feeding our families, if you get a vocational education -

Mr Shelton - Fixing our cars.

Mr ELLIS - and fixing our cars, getting us to work and home safely - I will digress briefly and thank Mr Shelton for his many years of service as a TAFE teacher. It's wonderful to have practical people in this place who have handed on the skills in their hands to the next generation.

Tonight, I will be attending the TasTAFE graduation ceremony in the south. I encourage anyone who's interested to get along. We will be celebrating 83 outstanding graduates and will be joined by around 160 proud family members and friends. We see fantastic turnouts in those graduations, which we've been really leaning into and embracing over the last 12 months in particular, because it's a powerful reminder for these graduates and the whole community that the community stands with each and every success story - people who have transformed their lives through learning, as we say at TasTAFE. They are really setting their course for brighter things.

The TAFE graduations take place across the state, in Hobart, Launceston, and Devonport. These events are even more than a celebration, although celebration is important. They are a moment to reflect on the determination and the growth that each student has shown, and the people who support them to succeed. So much needs to go right between that first moment where an apprentice walks through a business's door and says, 'I want to become a tradesperson'. It's that young person, of course, but it's the families around them, the teachers at TAFE, the support networks, and the businesses that take a risk on that young person and say, 'We're here to help transform your life, and we know that our business will grow with your personal growth'.

These ceremonies also shine a light on the power of vocational learning. VET opens doors. It changes lives for individuals and families. It strengthens our economy and our community. Every vocational education graduate is living proof of that, whether it's an apprentice starting out, someone seeking a career change, or those upskilling to advance their skills. Those who hold VET qualifications are building Tasmania's future. The graduates help build homes, deliver essential health care and services, create experiences in our visitor economy, and even more.

In the last 12 months, I have had the pleasure of doing two TAFE courses: my firearms safety course - Mr Di Falco you'll be very happy to know -

Mr Di Falco - I am.

Mr ELLIS - and the completely unflashy sounding - and it is this dry - LPG caravan and boat refresher course. The importance of CPD is not lost on me.

I encourage everyone in this place, if you haven't done a course through TasTAFE, this institution has really been transformed. There are many different opportunities. Particularly when it comes to AI and digital, this is transforming the way that we do our jobs, and how everyone in our economy is doing their jobs. There are big opportunities to upskill .Whether it's something at the cutting edge through that kind of digital learning, say through our cybersecurity centre that we have in Hobart, or a short course so that you can do more work on your own farm or your neighbour's, there are a range of different ways that you can transform your life through learning in ways big and small, by being part of this amazing institution of TasTAFE.

I congratulate those graduating from TasTAFE tonight and those in the coming weeks. Stick with it - we have the highest completion rates in the country. That is a testament to those learners, our teachers, TasTAFE, and all those whose help support our learners on that incredible journey.


Mt Field - Visitor Amenity
Charlie Kirk - Political Assassination in the US

[5.48 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I would like to provide some additional information as committed by the Premier this morning in relation to a question from the Greens member for Lyons, Ms Badger.

The Tasmanian Government is investing $7.8 million to make Mt Field a year-round destination. This includes improved signage, wayfinding, track upgrades, and new public huts to improve visitor safety and amenity. It's important to reiterate that we are still in the planning stages and no decision has been made. I am advised there has not been any consideration given to the privatisation of these assets but as the Premier indicated this morning, this is not being ruled out. The Tasmanian government takes its responsibilities for managing Tasmania's extensive reserve estate seriously and remains committed to delivering the tourism and expression of interest - Tourism EOI process, noting the important role it plays in facilitating sensitive and appropriate tourism projects with Tasmania's national parks, reserves and Crown land.

In the moments remaining, I just likewise would like to reflect on the tragic news this morning of the tragic killing of Charlie Kirk in the United States. It is politically motivated, clearly, and it is an act of violence which should absolutely be condemned.

I lived in the United States for 18 months in the mid to late 1980s, working there in a big law firm. I have two children currently live over there. I have a son and a daughter-in-law and a daughter there as well, in addition, and the Australian-US relationship is strong, but in anybody's book this is political violence.

He is a 31-year-old father of two. He was a mentor and a visionary for many people, including younger people from all around the world, not just in the US. I am very pleased to note that it has been condemned by both the Democrats and the Republicans, and I noticed that Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom called the attack disgusting, vile and reprehensible, while the Republican Secretary of State in the USA, Marco Rubio, said he was heartbroken and outraged by the assassination of Charlie Kirk. That is certainly a bipartisan approach, and likewise, here in Australia, I am sure many would have the same view. Freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to stand up and express those views, whatever they are, should be allowed and supported. I think it is a bit of a wake-up call certainly in the US and for us here in Australia as well.

I wanted to likewise condemn that political violence and condemn it wholeheartedly and re-emphasise our efforts to redouble our efforts here in Australia to work towards a society that is inclusive, caring and supportive of everyone who has a different viewpoint.


Bravehearts Day

[5.51 p.m.]
Ms BROWN - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight on the Adjournment to speak about something that is deeply important,  [Bookmark: _Hlk208509279] Bravehearts Day, which is held on Friday, 12 September 2025. Braveheart stays to break the silence on child sexual abuse, to be brave, to speak out on the violence against children and to help fight against sexual abuse and the exploitation of children and young people.

It is about education, empowerment and protection of our children and young people. As the Shadow Minister for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence, the protection of children against sexual violence is something I am very passionate about.

Child sexual abuse is experienced by one in four Australian children. I just want everybody to take a moment and let that sink in. How many children have been the victims of sexual abuse? It is a truly heartbreaking statistic. This is something we cannot be silent about. We need to break the silence, to drag this horrific crime out of the shadows and into the light, to show the devastating effects it not only has on the victims, but to the families and to our communities. Child sexual abuse is a global problem that has no physical, financial, socioeconomical, geographical, cultural or gender boundaries. It can truly affect anybody. All forms of child sexual abuse are a profound violation of human rights. This silence needs to be broken.

Bravehearts is not only about breaking the silence around child sexual abuse, but it is also about education. Personal safety education is an essential aspect of preventing child sexual abuse. Providing children and those who care and support them with age-appropriate information is vital for the prevention of child sexual abuse.

There is much that parents and caregivers can do at home to help build their child's personal safety skills. Bravehearts have a Keep Safe Adventure book and shows which encourage parents and caregivers to look into, and I encourage all parents and caregivers to look into the website. The aim for educational prevention is to teach children that they have the right to feel safe with anybody and it is okay to say no when they are feeling unsafe or that there is nothing out there that is too yucky that they cannot speak to a parent or a caregiver or somebody that they feel safe with.

I thank the Braveheart Foundation for the incredible work that they do for not only children and young people, but for all families across Australia. Thank you for your dedication on education, empowerment and protection of our children and young people. I would like to finish by reading our Bravehearts' vision, which is a world where people, communities and systems all work together to protect children from sexual abuse. I believe everybody in this parliament can take on board that saying and really work collaboratively in this place towards protecting all children from sexual abuse.


Homes Tasmania - Maintenance and Alterations of Properties

[5.55 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to speak about two of my constituents in relation to housing issues and both of them live in the Devonport area. I want to read into the Hansard a letter that I wrote recently to Minister Vincent and it was following a letter that I sent to the CEO of Homes Tasmania during the caretaker period. I was not very satisfied with the response I received, and so, I wanted to bring it to the attention of the minister.

I have not had a response yet, so that is why I am presenting it in the Adjournment tonight. I go on to say: 

I am writing to express my concern regarding the response provided by Homes Tasmania to the urgent health-related maintenance request submitted on behalf of Ms Cohen, a tenant residing in East Devonport.

Ms Cohen suffers from chronic respiratory conditions including asthma and COPD, which are significantly aggravated by allergens commonly found in carpet flooring. Her GP has recommended replacing the carpet with vinyl flooring to mitigate these health risks. Despite Ms Cohen's willingness to personally fund the replacement and installation, her request was initially denied.

I wrote to Homes Tasmania and they acknowledged receipt of medical documentation and confirmed that Ms Cohen's property is managed by Housing Choices Tasmania. However, the response dated 28 August 2025 from the CEO fails to adequately address the urgency and seriousness of the health concerns raised. Despite receiving medical documentation, the agency has not initiated any health-based accommodation or interim support.

Ms Cohen was informed of the property modification form process but declined to complete it, reportedly due to confusion or a lack of support. No effort appears to have been made to assist her in navigating this process. The agency's willingness to work with Ms Cohen is contingent on her completing forms and sourcing quotes, placing the burden entirely on a tenant already dealing with serious health issues, which I think is unacceptable.

Ms Cohen is expected to cover all costs associated with the modification and may be required to restore the flooring to its original condition upon vacating the property. This is unacceptable given the medical necessity of the change and the fact that the modification is not cosmetic, but essential for her health and wellbeing. The response lacks any indication of urgency, empathy or proactive engagement to resolve the matter. I have respectfully urged your office to intervene and ensure that Homes Tasmania and Housing Choices Tasmania adopt a more compassionate approach to health-related housing modifications.

Ms Cohen should not be financially penalised for seeking medically necessary adjustments to her home, nor should she be burdened with restoration costs for a change that directly supports her health. I wanted to bring that to the attention of the minister tonight and I do hope that I receive a response from him that provides support to Ms Cohen, not in the weeks and months to come, but as a matter of urgency.

The second issue that I want to raise is about one of my constituents, Judy, who lives in Devonport, who has had a rat infestation in her unit. She has paid herself for pest control measures a couple of times now, but the issue is actually with the structure of her carport that adjoins her unit. The rodents are entering the property from an adjoining property and there is some maintenance work required to be done. I have also written to the minister, Mr Vincent, about this. It is a simple thing that will fix the issue and save her a lot of money in pest control, which I understand if she was a Housing Choices tenant, would be paid for and not be the responsibility of the tenant. 

I have written to Mr Vincent about that. It is a simple solution. She has had someone inspect the property. They have indicated what needs to happen to remediate the issue. I visited her myself. Her unit is absolutely immaculate and she is so proud and pleased to be in there after waiting for it for a very long time. She just needs these simple modifications done and then she will be rid of her rat problem, which can only be a good thing.

The House adjourned at 5.59 p.m.
