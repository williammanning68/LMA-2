Tuesday 2 December 2025

The Honourable Speaker, Mrs Petrusma, took the Chair at 10.00 a.m., acknowledged the Traditional People, and read Prayers.


LEAVE OF ABSENCE

Member for Prosser - Mr Vincent

Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I advise the House that Minister Vincent will be absent from Question Time today due to illness. I will be taking questions with respect to his portfolios.


Member for Clark - Mr Willie

Ms FINLAY (Bass - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, similarly, I advise the House this morning that the Leader of the Labor Party, Josh Willie, is unwell and not here today.


QUESTIONS

North Launceston Football Club - Funding

Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER for SPORT, Mr DUIGAN

During Estimates, you admitted to withdrawing an offer of $100,000 to the North Launceston Football Club because the president appeared with Labor at a media event. It's less than two years before you kick them out and now you've withdrawn the funding, you're effectively leaving them without a home. York Park has been their home for over 100 years. Why are you punishing a community organisation simply for standing with another political party?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I take this opportunity to recognise the great work and the important place that the North Launceston Football Club has in the football landscape of Tasmania; a proud club, 103 years old. I am committed to them having a home in the short, medium and long term, and that's why we have established a working group which includes all the relevant stakeholders - the club, Launceston City Council, Stadiums Tasmania, and the Northern Tasmanian Football Association - and that working group has been working through the options for North Launceston going forward. 

Obviously we will see a very seismic change in the football landscape in Tasmania from next year, with the introduction of VFL football and, of course, from 2028 with our AFL and AFLW teams. UTAS Stadium will be a critical piece of infrastructure in that story, and there is a $130 million upgrade at that stadium going on now.

To your question, the North Launceston Football Club is having its annual general meeting on Wednesday, as I understand it, at which time and through the work of the working group they will be contacting my office and me and we will be looking forward to understanding what is the long-term future for North Launceston but, as I say, I am committed to an outcome for the club, as is the government.

Supplementary Question

Ms FINLAY - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms FINLAY - My question was very clear about the minister punishing a community organisation for standing with another political party. He didn't go anywhere near the question. My question to the minister is do you think it's appropriate to punish a community organisation for standing with another political party?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Minister for Sport.

Mr DUIGAN - To the detail of your question, those were absolutely discussions that were happening in the context of an election. I was in communication with the football club -

Mr Mitchell - You signed a letter.

The SPEAKER - Order, the honourable member for Lyons.

Mr DUIGAN - I put my thoughts down on paper and shared them with the club and various others and was looking for feedback. Shortly thereafter, I think the club decided that it preferred another option and that's the way it went. That's exactly what happened and I stand here committed to providing an outcome for North Launceston Football Club.


North Launceston Football Club - Funding

Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER for SPORT, Mr DUIGAN 

[10.06 a.m.]
Clearly, that deserves a second question to the Minister for Sport to put some facts on the record. You say you were thinking about it, minister. The fact is that your chief of staff sent a letter to the club president, Adrian Hall, and stated that the Liberal government would provide the club with $100,000 to plan for their future. Mr Hall says he only learned through the media following your train wreck of an Estimates attempt that the funding would be axed. That's not thinking, minister, that's commitments in writing. Did you or your chief of staff ever tell Mr Hall that the offer put in writing had been withdrawn simply because they stood with Labor for a photo? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. As I say, we stand here, I've put my thoughts on paper, we are committed to finding a way forward for the North Launceston Football Club. I met with Mr Hall at UTAS Stadium last week or at some stage and we talked about that and about him taking his club and his membership through the journey, through the work of the working group, to understand what options exist for the club. If there is an ask of government, it doesn't exist at the moment. If there is an ask of government, we will absolutely consider that. As I say, I stand committed to resolving the future of the North Launceston Football Club, as does this side of government, and we will make sure that -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Sorry, minister. I remind the honourable members of the opposition that you need to allow the minister to respond. He still has two more minutes to address your question, so I ask that you listen to him with respect. I remind everyone of your badges, to show respect too. 

Mr DUIGAN - Thanks, Speaker. As I say, we are committed and I am committed, as Minister for Sport, to sort this out and provide a home for North Launceston going forward and I hope to have more to say on this in the very short term, as -

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question is very clear. It asks whether Mr Duigan or his chief of staff ever told the club that they'd withdrawn the funding offer. I ask you to bring him back to the question.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, honourable Minister for Sport.

Mr DUIGAN - As I say, those discussions were part of an election campaign. I was sharing my thoughts with the club, with members of the North Tasmania Football Association (NTFA) so they knew what the government or what I was interested in doing.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Honourable members of the opposition, I will start issuing warnings and I remind members that they can occur very quickly. Warnings one, two and three can come within seconds, so I say to you all today to allow the ministers to respond, because we're going to have a respectful Question Time. 

Mr DUIGAN - Certainly, as I stand here, there's nothing in that letter that I resile from. I am happy to continue to work with the club.

Supplementary Question

Ms FINLAY - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms FINLAY - Minister, in that letter you indicated or the chief of staff indicated there would be $100,000 in funding for the club. I'd like you to confirm that you maintain your commitment to that if you say that you commit to everything that you put in writing. Speaker, the supplementary question is do you accept that Tasmanian sporting clubs, when provided a commitment from your government in an election, should be worried that if they talk to any other political party, whether the Greens or a member of the crossbench, they would be financially punished for doing so? Does that worry you, minister?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Minister for Sport. 

Mr DUIGAN - As I have said, I don't resile from anything that is in the contents of that letter. That was my position then.

What is really important to understand is that the club needs to decide what its position is, as it did on the days leading through the election when both parties were having conversations with the club. I don't resile from that, but I want to hear what the club has to say about this. It is important that the club -

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. My supplementary was clear. Thank you, minister, for saying that you agree to the words that your chief of staff wrote to the club in terms of the $100,000. 

Mr Duigan - I didn't resile from it.

Ms FINLAY - You said that you agreed to the content of the letter and secondly - my point of order on the supplementary is, do you believe that all sports clubs in Tasmania should worry about the financial implications of talking to other members of this parliament?

The SPEAKER - Time has expired.


Macquarie Point - Contaminated Soil

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.11 a.m.]
Last week in Legislative Council Estimates we caught Macquarie Point Development Corporation (MPDC) clearly misleading. We asked MPDC how much contaminated soil containing asbestos, lead, mercury, arsenic, cyanide and other chemicals of concern was under the footprint of your stadium and we were told is 130,000 cubic metres. When we later sought to confirm that amount with the Environment Protection Authority (EPA), we were told, in fact, it could be up to 220,000 cubic metres of contaminated soil - a significantly different number.

On Thursday, during the Legislative Council's hearing with the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) panel members, we asked whether MPDC had told the TPC about this huge volume of toxic soil that will need to be excavated, treated, stored and removed from the site. They had not. Apart from the obvious public health risks posed by this large volume of soil. It raises a question of trust. Given the untruths, how can Tasmanians -

The SPEAKER - The member's time for the question has expired.

Members interjecting.

Dr Woodruff - trust a single word MDPC says or you do either?

The SPEAKER - Next question, because there wasn't a question - that was a long statement, Dr Woodruff. You need to - at the heart, you did not get to your question.

Dr Woodruff - My question was - it goes to a matter of trust, and I didn't get to the follow-up question.

The SPEAKER - No, sorry, you had to ask a question.

Dr Woodruff - Speaker, I have never heard that - there was a question there. There was a question about the trust.

The SPEAKER - You said, 'my question is' and the time expired. You had a very long statement.

Dr Woodruff - I had a second question. The question throughout was about trust - how can anyone trust the Premier?

The SPEAKER - You are asking the question now. I remind members asking a question that you have one minute to ask a question and 30 seconds to ask a supplementary. It is not a time for a statement, it is to ask a question. The question did not get asked in that long statement. I encourage members to make your questions shorter and time them if necessary, but the time is not to make a statement to the House. 


Cancelled Metro Services

Mr O'BYRNE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.13 a.m.]
In August 2023, Metro cancelled 177 services across the Hobart network in what was described as a temporary adjustment. We're now two years on from that temporary adjustment and the 120 of those services remain cancelled. During Metro's scrutiny hearing last week, it was revealed that there were no plans to reintroduce these services, citing a Department of State Growth review. In 2023, we were told these cancellations were temporary. Metro have now confirmed the bleeding obvious - these services are permanently cancelled. Why did it take questions from me in scrutiny hearings for Tasmanians to discover that these bus services will remain cancelled, pending the outcome of a review - a review with no timeline?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question and his interest in this matter. Public transport is very important to all Tasmanians and it is essential for supporting Tasmanians get to where they need to be - work or recreation. We are very pleased we were able to support Tasmanians with half-price bus fares in the last 100 days, as part of our record of delivery. This has been some journey and I accept that you have been on this important matter for some time, Mr O'Byrne, including scrutiny last week.

The information that I have is that, in 2023 - the date that you referred to - Metro took the difficult step to suspend some of its less frequented services while maintaining its more popular services to reduce daily unexpected cancelled trips. Tranche two of the Metro service restoration started on 25 August 2025, restoring 29 services Monday to Thursday and 31 services on Friday. Together with the first tranche of restorations in November 2024, about 33 per cent of services originally suspended have now been restored. Metro's customer satisfaction has risen to 78 per cent in 2025 and that's increased in the last 12 months.

There is still a lot of work to do, I accept that. We're continuing on the greater Hobart network review and look forward to it being released for public consultation. The first phase of the review is due to come into effect in early 2026 and this will involve adjustments to the existing Metro timetable to maximise the use of existing services. Metro runs more than 2300 trips every day across Tasmania and has been working hard to recruit more drivers to strengthen their workforce, which has been a challenge. I will look in greater detail in terms of the response to your question. I will consult the minister, who's not able to be here today, but we are committed to improving the frequency, reliability and consistency of public transport networks across Tasmania.

Small Horticulture Producers - New Regulations

Prof RAZAY question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Mr PEARCE

[10.17 a.m.]
I refer to the proposed Primary Produce Safety (Horticulture Produce) Regulations 2025. Small market gardens and roadside stalls are big tourism attractions in Tasmania and are also extremely popular with the locals. They provide fresh produce directly from the garden to the consumer, which means their products are safer, fresher, and more nutritious than those from larger industrial growers. I am concerned that these new regulations will introduce stringent and costly new safety regulations, including significant paperwork and auditing requirements for small growers. Can the minister advise if the government is going to ensure that small growers do not have unfair and costly regulations imposed on them, so they can continue to provide fresh and nutritious produce at the market and roadside?

The SPEAKER - The members time for asking the question has expired.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. The member is of course talking about the national body, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, applying a food safety regime, or some legislation, for those selling fresh produce from a roadside store and the like. That needs to fit in with every state and territory across the country. What we've said, and the approach that we've taken, is one of consultation. We want to hear from growers, be they small growers or large, about what their particular concerns are, and we need to know the level of their operation because that will determine the risk that is involved. The reason that this has come to pass is that, in the last couple of years, there have been up to 10 deaths related to salmonella. The good member will understand the risks with salmonella and like. We need to cover that. At the same time, we also need to make this applicable to a small store holder versus a large commercial grower.

That's the approach that we've taken, that's the feedback we're getting from the community. That is, they're suggesting now - and we've extended that consultation time to 19 December, and we've run PR campaigns to get that news out. We want to hear that information; we want to hear their points. That's out to 19 December, and in the new year we'll put this all together.

At this stage, the feedback we're getting is they need a tiered system. That's what they're asking for. We're hearing their voices loud and clear. We don't want one-size-fits-all. It needs to be tailored, but it needs to be safe. I look forward to, in the early part of the year, coming to the House with a form that will suit all. 


Concrete Sand Shortage

Mr GEORGE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.21 a.m.]
The national body Cement Concrete & Aggregates Australia knew as far back as July that infrastructure costs in south-east Tasmania would soar as a result of the supply of suitable sand for concrete running out. How did it know? It knew because it had seen the Mineral Resources Tasmania (MRT) report warning of delays, cost increases, and the impact of having to ship suitable sand 300 kilometres from the north-east instead of 35 kilometres locally. The impact will be widely felt throughout the state's construction industry, but its impact on the Macquarie Point stadium will clearly be enormous. If the government knew of this shortage and of its impact, which it clearly did as far back as the July election, why did it conceal the report for months until the death knell of the stadium report?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I reject his assertion. The matter about sand supply - sand and stone aggregates are the second-most heavily extracted resources globally, surpassed only by water. Local Tasmanian quarries supply the bulk of raw materials necessary to build critical infrastructure.

With a high volume of construction projects underway - that's a good thing - and planned across the state, it's essential that projects can access the materials they need, when they need them. The construction industry is currently experiencing strong growth, presenting both opportunities and, of course, challenges. There are always challenges with growth, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't grow.

MRT recently released a new technical report, I'm advised, a study of the sand inventory of southeastern Tasmania, as part of the government's 100-day election commitments. The technical sand report discusses the current status of the sand resources in south-east Tasmania. The study has confirmed that while Tasmania has abundant sand deposits overall, the greater Hobart area faces growing challenges to sourcing concrete-grade sand close to major construction and infrastructure hubs, I'm advised.

As previous reports have indicated, the sterilisation of land suitable for potential future sand sources is one of the reasons for supply constraints in the greater Hobart region. We will continue to work with relevant planning authorities to ensure extractive industries are considered when making land use planning decisions. The technical sand report will also help guide industry in exploring for future sand resources to meet rising demand.

That is the information that I have. I appreciate the member asking a question about an input into a building. We look forward to further construction - not just the Macquarie Point stadium, but homes, hotels, and all sorts of great things that our hard-working tradespeople will be able to do to continue building Tasmania.

Supplementary Question

Mr GEORGE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr GEORGE - Premier, you have not answered my question. Why did the government sit on a Minerals Resources Tasmania document for four months, knowing its impact on the Macquarie Point stadium and also other infrastructure would affect costs throughout Tasmania and particularly on the stadium?

The SPEAKER - That is sort of going down a new path of enquiry. If the Premier has anything further to add?

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will just refer to our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future, 100 days of delivery, 20 August, 28 November 2025, which I'm very proud of. I appreciate all the work our team has done in bringing this together. We've even, so detailed is this report, in actual fact, that it mentions sand. Here we go -

Dr Broad - Is it the head in the sand bit?

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I'll give you that one, Shane. The first one I've given you in about seven years you've been here, but you got there, well done. That was good. 

Completed the investigation by Mineral Resources Tasmania into sand supply and released the report on the MRT website. The critical minerals prospectus -

North Launceston Football Club - Funding

Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER FOR SPORT, Mr DUIGAN

[10.26 a.m.]
I have to ask another question to the Minister for Sport, because I now have a second letter to North. This one was sent in February, so they've been working on this for a long time. It was sent to the club on 28 February 2025, and it says: 

It's not my intention that North will be left without a home. 

Yet isn't that exactly what you're doing? You need to apologise for this absolute shambles. Can't you see that it won't be possible for North to operate out of Invermay Park by the end of 2027 if they can't get to work on planning and design before next year, which is months before you're going to chuck them out of their home - a home they've had for 100 years?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I think that probably only emphasises the fact that we are committed to finding a home for North Launceston, to working with the club on their long-term future prospects. 

Ms FINLAY - You committed $100,000, minister, then took it away. It's childish behaviour.

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable acting Leader of the Opposition has asked a question. The minister has two-and-a-half minutes to answer it. Honourable minister, please continue. I ask that he's allowed to answer it in silence, please. 

Mr DUIGAN - As I have said, we will be very much guided by the club, by its members and what they would like to see for North Launceston going forward. The AGM will be held this Wednesday. I met with the president on Thursday last week in follow-up to all of this. We will work our way through this. They will not be left without a home. That will not be the case. We will work with the club, with Stadiums Tasmania, and we will find a way forward. 

It's important to also recognise that there are other stakeholders involved in this work. The City of Launceston Council, who is a co-owner of the University of Tasmania York Park precinct, is a very important stakeholder. We need them to be engaged with this. This is work that will continue, and we will get an outcome.


Supplementary Question

Ms FINLAY - I have a supplementary question, Speaker.

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms FINLAY - In his answer, the minister referred to other stakeholders and their role in this. He has referred to the fact that the President of North Launceston Football Club, their members, their players and all their supporters have done their job and have been doing it for a really long period of time. 

What the minister hasn't said in his answer is how will you make that happen when you made a written commitment of $100,000 to allow them to do this work, to find and secure a home beyond 2027? You put it in writing and you withdrew it because they stood with the Labor Party. How will you make sure that they have a home before 2027?

The SPEAKER - The honourable member's time has expired. Honourable Minister for Sport.

Mr DUIGAN - I am, the government is, committed to making sure that North Launceston is accommodated. In regard to those discussions, they were made during a campaign. An official commitment was not made. That's an important part - an official commitment was not made. I am committed to working with all parties.


Tasmanian Active Infrastructure Grants Program

Mr GARLAND question to MINISTER for SPORT, Mr DUIGAN

[10.30 a.m.]
In February of this year, you invited Tasmanians to submit applications for grants from a $5 million fund associated with the Tasmanian Active Infrastructure Grants Program. Applications for this round of grants closed on 30 April 2025, with successful applicants to be notified by 29 August 2025. We know you recently withdrew a sporting grant to North Launceston Football Club because it didn't stick to the Liberal government's script, but surely not all the applicants for these grants were Labor supporters? Why has your government not announced the outcome of the grants?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. The Tasmanian Active Infrastructure Grants Program is a really important program. It is one of the large grants programs that we run and enables clubs to access up to $500,000, so it makes really meaningful impacts to clubs, particularly in and around the area of upgrading change rooms and all those sorts of things. We're seeing infrastructure across the state which was built some time ago that perhaps didn't necessarily contemplate what we're seeing in the development of sport now, particularly when it comes to junior athletes and women and girls playing sport. I'm very pleased to have our Women and Girls in Sport Strategy imminently out in the public realm.

The issue with the grants round as it applied to this calendar year was the fact that, thanks to Mr Winter and others, we had an election brought into the middle of the year and that has necessitated a change to the way the grants have been rolled out and assessed. The announcement in our next 100-day plan announced the successful recipients of the Active Tasmania Infrastructure Grants. That work will happen through the month of December.


Macquarie Point - Contaminated Soil

Ms BURNET question to MINISTER for MACQUARIE POINT URBAN RENEWAL, Mr ABETZ

[10.33 a.m.]
We learnt at Estimates and from the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) hearing provided to the upper House that the Macquarie Point site contains up to 220,000 cubic metres of contaminated fill containing asbestos, lead, mercury, arsenic, cyanide, benzenes and other toxic chemicals. This is information the Macquarie Point Development Corporation (MPDC) apparently didn't provide to the TPC. It was confirmed by the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) that the regulated cap on the Copping C Cell is 45,000 cubic metres. If your stadium was to go ahead and construction begin, a significant public health issue is raised. 

What's the plan? It's clear to us that you and the MPDC can't be trusted to tell the truth about the contaminated soils on site. As minister responsible for the stadium, how do you explain MPDC's misleading information, and can you give any assurance that this high volume of contaminated soil can be safely dealt with?

The SPEAKER - The member's time has expired.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I wish I could thank the member for Clark for the question, but the aspersions cast on very good public servants is something that should not be occurring in this place. By all means, attack me, attack members of the government, but don't attack public servants who cannot defend themselves in this place.

We are asked to accept at face value the numbers provided by the Greens. Last Sunday, there was a group of 15,000 people gathered and the Greens tell us that was equivalent to the 1500 that appeared the week before, so I am very sceptical, forgive me, but experience has taught me to be exceptionally careful when Greens quote numbers and assert things because I've been burnt once too often, so I will be exceptionally careful. However, let's also be exceptionally clear -

Dr Woodruff - Get to the question, get to the Hansard, get to the truth.

The SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff.

Ms BURNET - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. I draw the minister to the question.

The SPEAKER - I ask the honourable Treasurer to be relevant to the question, please.

Mr ABETZ - I thought I was, but I can understand that the answer is uncomfortable for the member for Clark. What I would say to the member for Clark, even assuming that which you assert is correct - let's assume that just for once, very dangerous, I know, but we will assume it - that contaminated soil would need to be removed, irrespective of the project that was going to take place on the site. Indeed, Labor and the Greens at one stage wanted a hospital there, all on contaminated soil. Having the odd concert, convention or football game compared to a hospital was not an issue for the Greens at the time. It's only become an issue because they don't like the AFL stadium and the multipurpose nature of it.

Dr Woodruff - You need three more Coppings.

The SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff.

Mr ABETZ - I'm further advised the testing undertaken by the MPDC indicates that approximately 10 per cent of the historical fill estimated to be removed will require disposal at Copping, and this is well within the facility's annual capacity. The MPDC has drilled I don't know how many hundreds of holes on the site to determine the levels of contamination. Isn't it amazing when we refer to the site as an 'industrial wasteland' the Greens attack us for referring to it as such, but then when it suits them they say the whole site is contaminated and how dare you build anything on it. I just wish there was some consistency.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Treasurer's time has expired.

Supplementary Question

Ms BURNET - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Ms BURNET - The question I asked was what's the plan? I draw the minister's attention to what was put on the public record, that there is about 220,000 cubic metres of contaminated fill. What's the plan, because Copping won't be able to take all of that?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - Speaker, it's one of those problems when you have a supplementary question and you want to ask it without listening to the answer. I just indicated to you that Copping can take the amount. I will repeat it again for the benefit of the honourable member. I'm further advised that testing undertaken by MPDC indicates that approximately 10 per cent of the historical fill estimated to be removed will require disposal at Copping. This is well within the facility's annual capacity.

Dr Woodruff - That's not what they said to the Legislative Council.

The SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff.

Mr ABETZ - Leader of the Greens, we know that the member for Clark had to ask your question because you didn't quite get around to it, but that doesn't give you licence to interject on the answer. What I would say to the member for Clark is that the contamination will be removed by all the required standards and the people who use that facility can be guaranteed that they will be safe and there is no human health issue.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Treasurer's time has expired.


North Launceston Football Club - Funding

Mrs GREENE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.38 a.m.]
Your Sports minister admitted in a budget Estimates hearing that he cancelled funding for the North Launceston Football Club because the club president stood next to Labor in the media. Last year, the former Sports minister cancelled a large event at Mudbar because the owner supported a Labor policy. This is a pattern of behaviour from your government. Do you think it's acceptable for a minister to retaliate against a local football club for engaging with another political party? Does this behaviour meet your ministerial code of conduct?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank Mrs Greene for the question and I appreciate your commitment to your electorate and sporting infrastructure across the wonderful electorate of Bass. I don't agree with how you've characterised the matters you've raised. We are working with all Tasmanians, irrespective of who they may support at the ballot box. We treat all Tasmanians equally in terms of the services they require or ask for. Of course we cannot deliver on 100 per cent of what comes across our desk but we do our very best to support -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Honourable members of the Opposition, there have been a lot of interjections already. The Premier still has two minutes and I ask that he be heard in silence, or I will have to start issuing warnings.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We support many, many community organisations, because it's an opportunity for me now to say how much we value the volunteers of those organisations. I reflected on this over the weekend [Bookmark: Phr2_O=26.3_D=2.8_C=0.89]  when, wherever we go to -  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=29.8_D=14.3_C=0.86] sporting clubs, community clubs and service clubs - it's always good to reflect on the history of those organisations, and who's contributed over the many generations to the success of those clubs. Principally,  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=44.7_D=24.8_C=0.82] volunteers. We would not be able to support social capital, or indeed communities, when it comes to supporting community organisations, without volunteers. I commend the volunteers. We are working well on the example you have provided. 

Mrs GREENE - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. I would really appreciate actually having a response to the question.

Ms Finlay - Does it meet the standards?

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=70.6_D=0.7_C=0.80] The SPEAKER - Order, honourable Acting Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the honourable member for your question. I don't agree with your characterisation of the particular issue. We have our minister working with the football club in providing a solution and we welcome that good, constructive dialogue, which will continue.
 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=98.1_D=3.8_C=0.49] 
Supplementary Question

Mrs GREENE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mrs GREENE - Premier, is this  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=103.3_D=5.9_C=0.85] conduct acceptable, yes or no? Does it comply with the code of conduct?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Premier. 

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=113.2_D=7.6_C=0.78] Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the honourable member for your question. I don't accept the characterisation as presented in your question. We are all working hard for our communities to support all those that contact us as local members. We are local members first and foremost, and I support the work of all our ministers and our local members. 

Ms Finlay - You wrote to them making a commitment.

The SPEAKER - Acting Leader of the Opposition, this is your first warning. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I often get requests from others across the Chamber when it comes to  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=152.9_D=13.0_C=0.80] supporting local communities, community events, when it comes to the Premier's Discretionary Fund as well.

Ms Haddad - Vindictive. Really vindictive.

The SPEAKER - Order, honourable member for Clark.

The SPEAKER - I expect all our members to comply with the code of conduct, as I would expect all members in the House of Assembly.

Macquarie Point Stadium - Interest on Borrowings

Ms JOHNSTON question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[10.43 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=174.1_D=29.4_C=0.73] Former Treasury secretary, Martin Wallace, in his capacity as a TPC panellist on the stadium, last week confirmed to Legislative Council members some shocking truths. He said that within five years of borrowings to fund the stadium build, Tasmanians will be paying a $90 million interest bill in that year alone. He said the debt burden was 'a completely untenable situation.' Do you agree with Mr Wallace? If you don't, and dismiss Martin Wallace's, former head of  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=204.3_D=13.7_C=0.84] Treasury, expert advice as just another opinion, then will you please show and table your numbers to prove him wrong? 

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=220.4_D=12.4_C=0.84] Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. With respect, I do disagree with Mr Wallace and the figures he presented. As a former secretary, of course, you listen [Bookmark: Phr18_O=233.1_D=30.0_C=0.80]  to him, but one also takes up-to-date advice and the considerations. 

From our perspective as a government, what we are looking towards is seeking to grow the economy, and that is why the stadium is so fundamentally important. A brand new payroll coming into this state of $44 million, a brand new hotel - if not two - the expansions that are being considered right around the waterfront on the basis of  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=263.4_D=22.4_C=0.82] the stadium being approved. There is, if I might say, a divergence of views in relation to that, but I am backing in - with the 15,000 that were outside this place on Sunday - that there is the opportunity to grow our economy with this proposal.

In relation to the  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=287.8_D=5.1_C=0.79] interest payments that will be required, if you take into account  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=293.4_D=11.6_C=0.89] the budget and the amount that we are borrowing - and I am on record, we are borrowing too much - but the big question is, and that is something that has to be considered - is the borrowing for the net operating activities of government or something that will last for decades and generations to come, that you can look down the camera barrel and say, 'I don't mind if my kids and my grandkids keep on helping to pay for this piece of infrastructure, because they're going to get a full lifetime out of it, I won't.' Therefore, there is, in my humble opinion, a divergence of views. If you're building something for the future that is multigenerational and something which is for the here and now, that is fundamentally different. 

I believe I tabled an answer, or provided an answer, in relation to the interest payments that will be made. I can provide that in further detail, but I think I've already tabled it. We are looking at the debt servicing cost estimate on equity transfer state funding of $113,000 in 2024-25 through to $3 million, or $3.321 million, in 2031-32. In the scheme of things, this stadium is going to be less than one per cent of our budget, but it will be so transformative. That is what has to be considered and understood. 

You can always find fault with any new proposal. What I encourage people to do is grab the opportunity.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Treasurer's time has expired.


Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms JOHNSTON - The Treasurer has answered the part that he doesn't agree with Mr Wallace, but he hasn't answered the second part. Mr Wallace has tabled and shown his workings on how he came to estimate the total cost of borrowings for the total amount borrowed. Will you also table and show your numbers to prove that he is wrong?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - One of the great things about economics is that it's not an exact science, and depending on the fundamentals you pump in at the beginning, you will get different answers. That is why the cost-benefit ratio for this proposal, every single economist that has been asked to look at it has disagreed with every other one. It is not an exact science. Indeed, I think the best report of all came out of the Hobart City Council of a $179 million benefit for the Hobart City Council area, and because it was so inconvenient, the Lord Mayor said, 'Just park that, ignore that. We don't want to look at that. We will just criticise it anyway.'

With respect, economists give us their best opinion, but it doesn't mean they're necessarily right. Indeed, just in recent times, I was told the no-worse-off guarantee for the GST funding wouldn't cost the Commonwealth anything in 2018. Thus far, it's cost them $42 billion. Sometimes they get it wrong.

Macquarie Point Stadium - Economic Growth

Mr BAYLEY question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[10.48 a.m.]
Major rating agencies have now downgraded Tasmania's credit rating, with S&P Global identifying the stadium and potential cost overruns as an issue. A lower credit rating will lead to increased rates on future debt - a debt that will grow massively by building the stadium. Meanwhile, the former Treasury boss, who spent a year considering the stadium as part of the independent assessment panel, gave evidence to the Legislative Council that the cost of servicing the debt will rise to $90 million per year within five years. Because we will have to borrow to pay the interest costs on the stadium debt, Tasmania will be in what Mr Wallace calls a 'compound interest trap'. 

Given your long-stated attitude to intergenerational debt, you've just justified this by saying you're going to 'grow the pie', yet your own Treasury, in the Pre-Election Financial Outlook (PEFO), has rejected that you can grow your way out of the problems associated with the Budget. Do you have advice from Treasury that the stadium will lead to growth of the economy?

Time expired.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. Please don't verbal me. In relation to the Budget and getting things back into shape, it will be multifactorial, and one of those is to grow the pie. Is that the whole answer? Of course it isn't. We do have to rein in expenditure as well. If you have a look at the expenditure issue, the payment of public servants, for example, makes up 46 per cent of our Budget. If you get rid of the stadium, of about 1 per cent over the forward Estimates, it isn't going to make much difference, is it? This is where our friends from time to time find it convenient to only talk about one aspect or say, 'growing the economy won't do it', I agree. 

Mr BAYLEY - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question was, do you have advice from Treasury about growing the pie, are they telling you that it's going to deliver the kind of numbers you believe?

The SPEAKER - Thank you, honourable Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - I thought I was talking about growing the pie and that it was not and that it was not the only answer.

Mr Bayley - The question was, do you have advice from Treasury?

Mr ABETZ - Of course, I get and take advice from Treasury from time to time. I get advice from all over the place and then at the end of the day we, on this side, are elected and appointed to make decisions. We listen to advice, but we decide and that is part and parcel of our Westminster system and listening to those 15,000 outside of this place just last Sunday. I don't think they were all wrong. I happen to believe that all of them happen to be right. I know that you were there with a rally of 1500, in comparison, the previous Sunday. You're entitled to your opinion. You're entitled to your views, just as much as just as much as I am -

Dr Woodruff - Just answer the question.

The SPEAKER - Order, Dr Woodruff.

Mr ABETZ - and the majority of this House, as they have expressed it, in support of this proposal.

Growing the pie will be assisted by the stadium. That's part of the issue with the budget. We will continue to work through on other areas as well to ensure that we get the budget back to where it ought to be over the forward Estimates. That is what I've committed myself to, the government's committed itself to and we will work exceptionally hard to deliver that for the people of Tasmania. Just because we have a problem here, doesn't mean we shouldn't grab - with both hands - the opportunities that are over here which will provide such great economic stimulus for our state and for our young people.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Treasurer's time has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr BAYLEY - The Treasurer just talked about that he has listened to the advice. Well, it's plainly obvious that he hasn't listened to the experts at the Planning Commission, the Treasury boss, people like Nicholas Gruen, for example. However, he mentioned that growing the pie will be assisted by the stadium, and I come back to my original question: on what basis do you make that statement? Do you have advice from your own Treasury department that justifies and backs up that statement? Or do you have advice from anyone else that backs up that statement? If so, can you provide it?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - In relation to the economic benefits, all I need to do is listen to the lord mayor's own economic advice of $179 million each and every year. You see, member for Clark, it depends on who you want to listen to. Economics is not an exact science, as I've said a number of times, therefore, we need to make our own decisions.

You happened to mentioned Nick Gruen, was he the fellow who was duchessed around by Roland Browne before he undertook his inquiry?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Honourable members of the Greens.

Mr ABETZ - The same Roland Browne who informed the public that the numbers were similar at the two rallies. Do you know what? I think it was nearly right. The only difference was a zero on the end - 1500 to 15,000. That's the sort of talk we get out of Mr Browne. He duchessed Nick Gruen around -

The SPEAKER - The member's time has expired.

Mr Abetz - Oh, what a pity.


North West Football Club - Funding

Mrs GREENE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.54 a.m.]
Your Sports minister admitted to withdrawing funding to punish a community organisation simply for appearing with Labor in the media. Your ministerial code of conduct says:

Ministers must take all reasonable steps to observe relevant standards of procedural fairness in decisions made by them. Such decisions are to be unaffected by bias or irrelevant considerations. 

His behaviour is a blatant breach of standards expected by Tasmanians, has put the future of one of the oldest and most successful football clubs in the state at risk, and breaches your own ministerial code of conduct. What are you going to do about it?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question, but I don't accept their characterisation, I have said that. Mr Duigan, who is a hard-working local member for Windermere and a very hard-working minister, will work with all members of the community, both within his electorate and wider. I understand that Mr Duigan met with the North Launceston Football Club last week and that he's willing, of course, and absolutely engaged in ensuring that North Launceston has a home.

Supplementary Question

Mrs GREENE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mrs GREENE - Premier, is this the standard that you expect from your ministers, yes or no, and will you investigate this matter to ensure public confidence in your ministers?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I have every confidence in my ministers.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Cost

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[10.56 a.m.]
Last year the Premier promised Tasmanians his government would invest no more than $375 million into building the stadium. You first said any costs above that would be paid by the private sector, then later you abandoned the plan for private investors. Despite that, you argued he hadn't broken the cost cap promise. You've claimed borrowings are not capital - which has always been ridiculous - and in budget Estimates, we heard your Treasurer, Eric Abetz, directly contradict that idea. He said borrowings are clearly going to be part of the capital input and repeated it several times. He completely undermined your argument that you didn't break your cost cap promise.

Now that your Treasurer has contradicted your ridiculous efforts to spin Tasmanians, will you finally admit that the $375 million cost cap is dead? You've broken your promise and it's going to cost Tasmanians the earth.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank Dr Woodruff for the question, who has been consistent in opposing the stadium and indeed many other economic growth opportunities across Tasmania. I don't accept the verballing of our Treasurer at all. We've been very upfront about our $1.13 billion investment for the Tasmanian people, including $375 million of state capital funding, $240 million of federal government funding and $15 million of AFL funding. We've always been clear that the balance of funding required will be made-up of borrowings from the Macquarie Point Development Corporation.

You talk about costs. The opportunity cost of this not going ahead will be devastating for the state of Tasmania. For all the important discussions about budgets and ensuring we're living within our means, I would much rather frame a budget in a growing economy than one in recession. Can I say this, if we cannot get this done, interstate mainland investors and probably further afield will have a very dim view of Tasmania as a place to invest. We have an opportunity to grasp what many Tasmanians have been fighting for decades. We have $240 million of federal government investment, $15 million from the AFL, and all the goodwill of Tasmanian people, including the 15,000 that came from every corner of Tasmania to be at that rally and express a view. As I said yesterday, the largest rally ever for something in Tasmania because people feel very passionate about it and 10 times more people there, according to police estimates, than the anti rally the week before.

I accept people have different views on this stadium and every view to the negative and every question that's raised, will make this a better project. With the 'glass half full' attitude I've always had when it comes to this project, should this proceed across the parliament towards the end of this week, when the debate is expected to conclude, it will be a momentous and unifying occasion for Tasmania. Far more unifying moving forward with the stadium, with the Tasmania Devils, with the economic opportunity and with the jobs opportunity, than not at all.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Premier's time has expired.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - Honourable Speaker, the Premier didn't address my question, which was that the Treasurer had contradicted his attempts to call borrowings not part of capital. He also said that I'd verballed the Treasurer. I hadn't; I read from the Hansard. In the Hansard, the Treasurer said:

If you buy a house you make a deposit on the house, and that is, if you like, just as much a capital investment as a mortgage.

Was your Treasurer wrong, or will you admit to Tasmanians that you've broken the cap?

The SPEAKER - The honourable member's time has expired.

Members interjecting.

Dr Woodruff - Is he wrong, or did you break your promise? It's going to cost more than $375 million.

The SPEAKER - Order. It's not the time for a statement, Dr Woodruff.

Mr ROCKLIFF - There is $375 million of capital the Tasmanian government is putting forward - we're looking forward to that contribution. We are also very grateful, I have to say, with the $240 million provided by the federal government and GST exemption as well.

Dr Woodruff - On the $375 million.

The SPEAKER - Order, Dr Woodruff.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I very much appreciate all those contributions.

Tasracing Mass Text Message - Legality

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.02 a.m.]
On 2 July Tasracing used government resources and staff to send a mass text message and online communications promoting the Liberal Party's election commitment, stating that your make-believe insurance agency TasInsure would provide workers' compensation to racing participants. That breaches caretaker conventions, the State Service principles, the State Service Code of Conduct, and potentially breaches the GBE Act and the State Service Act as well. Were you or anyone in your government or office made aware that these text messages were being sent? When did you become aware that it had occurred, do you agree that your own policies had been breached and potentially the law, and if so, what will you do about it?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course, we're a Liberal government and firstly, we're getting on with the job and listening to Tasmanians and addressing the very real concerns when it comes to the cost of living across a range of areas, including insurance. I look forward to developing the TasInsure commitment for the benefit of the Tasmanian people.

To the best of my knowledge, the first time I found out about the text message was last week during Estimates. I can't speak for the matters around Tasracing. I was very busy during the campaign, every single day for 40 days in a row, meeting with Tasmanians in every corner of the state, including the two islands as well.

Mr Ferguson - Hear, hear, both islands. Very busy.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, Mr Ferguson, member for Bass; he loves Flinders Island.

I engaged very heavily in an election campaign. I can say that this is an important operational matter and I welcome Tasracing advocating for their participants and keeping their stakeholders informed, but that's a matter for Tasracing.

Mr Mitchell - No integrity.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Lyons.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What I'm looking forward to is delivering that policy. Thank you.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - The Premier says this is a matter for Tasracing, but I would have thought the State Service Act, code of practice and GBE Act would be a matter for him. Is the Premier seriously saying that Tasracing, on face value, has done nothing wrong and he's not prepared to follow this important issue up?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Sorry, I missed that, Dean. What was that?

Mr WINTER - Is the Premier seriously saying that Tasracing has done nothing wrong and that he's not going to follow up?

Mr ROCKLIFF - My understanding is as soon as the Chair of Tasracing was made aware, the matter was -

Mr Winter - The text messages had gone out.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes, I understand. Anyway, I'll get more information on that. As stated at the GBE scrutiny of Tasracing, this was an operational matter and a decision made by the company Tasracing.

I've been informed that insurance and in particular workers' compensation is unaffordable for many trainers and operators in the racing industry and is having a big impact on their businesses.

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance to the question. 

The SPEAKER - Premier, the member had already called a point of order before you finished.

Mr WINTER - Are you aware that this i [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.8_D=2.9_C=0.30] s potentially unlawful behaviour, Premier, and what are you going to do about it?

The SPEAKER -  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=32.1_D=4.2_C=0.86] I bring the Premier back to wrap up his response.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Taking a point of order is not a time for a statement. I bring the Premier back to the original [Bookmark: Phr4_O=37.7_D=6.8_C=0.78]  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=45.9_D=0.7_C=0.75]  supplementary.

[11.06 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=54.4_D=22.2_C=0.77] I think this warrants more questions, honourable Speaker. Premier, will you order an investigation into whether Tasracing or its employees breached the State Service Act principles or code of conduct in sending that text message spruiking Liberal Party policy? Will you order an investigation into what occurred and whether the law was breached? If not, why not?

Forestry - Federal Legislation Changes

Mr Di FALCO question to MINISTER for BUSINESS, INDUSTRY and RESOURCES, Mr ELLIS

[11.07 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=91.9_D=2.6_C=0.68]  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=112.7_D=4.8_C=0.83]  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=118.1_D=15.3_C=0.74] I've had a lot of calls from landowners this week after the announcement of the federal government regarding forestry. If this new policy increases bushfire fuel loads due to slowed operations or additional red tape [Bookmark: Phr12_O=133.4_D=8.2_C=0.77] , what additional resourcing will be provided to protect communities such as Lyons in high-risk regions?

ANSWER
 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=143.3_D=3.0_C=0.79]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=147.1_D=16.6_C=0.78] 
Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Lyons for his question and his passionate defence of our foresters and forest firefighters last week and also his lived experience in the south-east with some devastating bushfires. You're right, there is [Bookmark: Phr15_O=163.9_D=29.6_C=0.85]  a high degree of concern about the federal government's announcement of the deal with the Greens on forestry. It is deeply concerning that any action to undermine the Regional Forest Agreement means that there will not be native forestry here in Tasmania. 

We're working closely with the industry, with workers and everyone who's affected, including local businesses, about what exactly this will mean. I think it would be fair to say that the federal government has been clear [Bookmark: Phr16_O=193.8_D=30.0_C=0.84]  as mud on their approach going forward. This is very complex legislation. They have not been able to point to how this legislation provides a future for the Regional Forest Agreement that underpins native forestry, and the Tasmanian Forest Products Association made it very clear after meeting with the two relevant federal ministers in Launceston yesterday, one of whom is Tasmanian, that they are very concerned the federal government will not provide guarantees [Bookmark: Phr17_O=224.2_D=28.8_C=0.86]  that no forest business will be worse off under this legislation. That is very concerning. The federal government must provide that guarantee. 

What we saw on the other side of the House was the Greens popping champagne corks last week after the announcement. We saw Dr Broad for five seconds say that he was opposed to the action of the federal government and that it would mean the inevitable loss of Tasmania's native forest sector. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=253.2_D=2.4_C=0.81]  He's changed his mind and I'm not quite sure why.

Dr BROAD - [Bookmark: Phr19_O=257.9_D=0.4_C=0.91]  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=259.5_D=29.2_C=0.74]  Honourable Speaker, I seek a personal explanation. 

The SPEAKER - That will be at the end of Question Time. 

Mr ELLIS - I'm really looking forward to that, Speaker, because the only reason I can see why Dr Broad has changed his mind -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order; the only one who should be speaking is the minister,

Mr ELLIS - is because the Labor Party in Tasmania are under federal administration. They are owned by Canberra and they won't stand up for Tasmanian workers, just as they did on Bell Bay Aluminium, which I think was a great shame and disgrace for the opposition. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=289.6_D=15.4_C=0.85]  We only have 30-something seconds left. Can we please allow the honourable minister to finish his response? 

Mr ELLIS - In terms of financial resources, particularly on firefighting, this is one of the key areas of concern for us - $300 million for the country for go away money is not going to cut it. That will mean an enormous loss of jobs but also huge capability. We've seen the decay of forest firefighting capability in Victoria and the devastating impacts that is having right across communities around regional Australia. We will continue to support this industry and these jobs and work closely to ensure they have a bright future.

Time expired.


PERSONAL EXPLANATION

Member for Braddon - Dr Broad

Dr BROAD - Honourable Speaker, the minister continually misleads, misquotes and verbals me. I did not say that native forestry was going to inevitably end, he knows this. I said that there will be an inevitable reduction in supply, that has long been predicted. I have never said that native forestry is going to inevitably end. He knows this and I seek that he cease saying that and withdraw.

The SPEAKER - Under standing order 127, he cannot withdraw but you've given your personal explanation and that is now on the Hansard.


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Further Investigation of a Constituent's Medical Case

Ms HADDAD question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Ms ARCHER

My question is from Stephen Rossiter. Mr Rossiter has a long-standing grievance with the Tasmanian Health Service. He underwent MRI scans in 2014 and 2016 that showed brain lesions, but these were not identified by specialists at the Royal Hobart Hospital. In 2022, Monash Medical Centre diagnosed the lesion, confirmed by radiology and the head of neurology at that centre, yet the diagnosis remains unacknowledged by Royal Hobart Hospital specialists.

In January 2023, the then-health secretary, Catherine Morgan-Wicks, committed to an independent interstate investigation into Mr Rossiter's case. Despite repeated follow-ups, this investigation has not been initiated. Mr Rossiter also fears his experience reflects deeper concerns about diagnostic failures and transparency within the Tasmanian Health Service. Minister, will the independent investigation promised by the former secretary be conducted and will you meet with Mr Rossiter to hear his concerns directly?


Liberty Bell Bay Manganese Smelter

Mr FERGUSON question to MINISTER for BUSINESS, INDUSTRY and RESOURCES, Mr ELLIS

In asking this question, I'm representing a number of constituents and small business operators in the Bell Bay precinct. My question is to the Minister for Business, Industry and Resources. Minister, what conversations are you engaged in in relation to Liberty Bell Bay, Tasmania's and Australia's only manganese smelter, noting this government's $20 million loan facility provided to keep the manganese smelter in operation and will you provide an update on the matter?

It's very important to my constituents and, indeed, the entire northern Tasmanian economy and, for that matter, the state economy. Noting the government's recent formation of a Bell Bay response team and, of course, the importance of this smelter in Bell Bay to the broader economy and community.


Stadium Rally Attendance

Mr GEORGE question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS 

My question is from my constituents, Dr Robert Brown. What method of measuring crowd numbers did police officers use at the rallies for and against the stadium in Hobart?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Pause the clock, please. I remind members that the member for Franklin only has a minute so I do ask members to not interject so he can finish off his question, please.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The only one who should be speaking right now is me or the member for Franklin. The member for Franklin has the call.

Mr GEORGE - How are officers trained in estimating crowd sizes and who authorized the release of those estimates to the media? Does the commissioner stand behind the police indication that one crowd was 1500 and the other 15,000?


Mornington Roundabout - Update

Mr WINTER question to INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

My constituent lives in Mornington on thee shore and points out that, despite the many promises about the Mornington roundabout for many years, nothing has actually happened. He points out that there's been no progress updates on this issue for many years. He has discovered that the promised federal funding has been allocated, but the state Liberal government has still not built anything. He asks when will the promised Mornington roundabout upgrade be finally delivered so that residents can have a safe intersection to travel?


Salmon Industry - Impact on Marine Environment

Dr WOODRUFF question to PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Mr PEARCE

My question is from Mary Kate in Cygnet, who's so concerned about the effects of salmon farming in her area that she and other members of her local swimming group are worried about going into the water. They're sick of the salmon industry destroying the health of their waters, whether it's diseased and dying fish washing up on their beaches or now the florfenicol that's coating feed and being dumped in large quantities.

The Cygnet Sea Urchins are cold water swimmers and they've had to move their swims to Kingston and some have stopped swimming altogether. They swim for physical and emotional health, which is impossible due to these impacts. They want to know when you will restore their beautiful local marine environment and ask whether you will rein in the industry and require it to move, destock all fallow salmon pens to stop the antibiotic being dumped into waterways.


Public Transport - Completion of Claremont Park and Ride

Mr VERMEY question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

My constituents in Clark, in particular the northern end, have special interest in finding out about the public transport and asking when the Claremont Park and ride will be completed and can the minister provide an update.


Frankford Highway - Upgrades

Ms DOW question to Minister for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure. Can you please provide an update for my constituent from Wynyard on the upgrades that the government proposes to do with the Frankford Highway with detailed timelines?

Paper tabled.
MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Corruption and Integrity

[11.24 a.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House take note of the following matter: corruption and integrity. 

It's no wonder that we would raise such a topic after the appalling conduct through Question Time today, and not only in Question Time, but through Estimates, through the election campaigns and, in fact, through all of government. What we're seeing right now in this government is a pattern of behaviour. It's a way of being. It is a personality that this government can't seem to find the way to care to tell the truth and operate in a way that would pass most pub tests right across Tasmania, or the more worrying application is that they're not capable of being upfront with Tasmanians and continue to lure Tasmanians into false expectations, raise hope and then snatch it away just because things do not go quite as they planned.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=17.7_D=29.7_C=0.86] As I talk to members across this parliament, not just on this side of the House, it is unbelievable that a government would treat community organisations this way - not just sports organisations, as we prosecuted in Question Time this morning, but any organisation, community or otherwise, across Tasmania. They worry about the commitments they are being given by this government because nothing seems to matter anymore. Their word does not matter, something in writing does not matter, and in fact, there is almost an expectation now that if the government says something, let's not rely on that, let's look to the complete opposite.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=47.5_D=30.0_C=0.83] This morning in Question Time we again raised the matters raised in Estimates last week about an in-writing indication to the North Launceston Football Club that the government would, if re-elected, contribute $100,000 for them to secure a home because they were being chucked out of the place that's been their home for over 100 years at York Park. Now the minister says he was just thinking about it. When you put in writing to someone a commitment that you are going to make  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=77.7_D=30.0_C=0.81] if elected, then someone actually relies on the information. The North Launceston Football Club relied on that information and wanted to ensure the security of their members. 

They are an iconic and well-regarded, proud club in northern Tasmania, a club in fact in the Sports minister's own electorate, and they are working with their players, the players' families, their volunteers and their supporters, hundreds of northerners, to secure their future and they get let down by this club. 

I am going to seek leave to table the letters we have been  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=107.7_D=28.4_C=0.80] referring to through Estimates and Question Time this morning, I am going to table the email sent following discussions with the minister to the president of the North Launceston Football Club, Adrian Hall, and seek leave to table the letter sent by and signed by Nick Duigan in February, months earlier, to the then president Thane Brady around commitments to their home being secured. 

The SPEAKER - Has the honourable member circulated those?

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=137.0_D=1.6_C=0.71] Ms FINLAY - I have spoken to members across the parliament.

The SPEAKER - With the members of government?

Ms FINLAY - These are your letters, government.

The SPEAKER - You have to still circulate them.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=138.9_D=12.5_C=0.74] Ms FINLAY - The government hasn't seen the letters they sent to the president?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Ms FINLAY - It is hilarious that the government would question what they put in writing. They cannot expect people in the community -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. I remind the honourable member that you do need to allow other people to see it in case it is not the document you are saying is being tabled. 

Mr Ferguson - That was a misleading statement.

The SPEAKER - Order, honourable member for Bass. Honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition [Bookmark: Phr10_O=188.3_D=29.4_C=0.82] , you can continue while they look at it. 

Ms FINLAY - Once the government have had a chance to review their own documentation committing, in writing, $100,000 to the club if re-elected, and another letter that demonstrated they had been working on this for months, I would be pleased if the House received those papers and they could be tabled, because this goes to the deep mistrust that Tasmanians have for this government. I think it's important to put on record that it's not  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=217.8_D=15.0_C=0.85] just a concern about Liberal and Labor, this is a concern about all parties in this place. It is a concern about all members of the crossbench who would want to actively engage in conversations with different organisations and different sporting clubs to seek to support them in their endeavours.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=232.9_D=14.6_C=0.86] It is not just about election time, it is not just about sports clubs, but we know that letters have been written to, for instance, the NRMs in Tasmania and they were told there's no intention of this government to reduce direct, indirect or in-kind support  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=247.6_D=15.0_C=0.81] for Tasmanian NRM organisations, and they have cut them dramatically. There is the Flinders Island airport. Flinders Island was committed $320,000 to support with lighting at the airport, but it is not committed in the Budget, and people are being written letters saying, 'We may consider it in the next budget.'  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=262.8_D=13.8_C=0.73] This government cannot be taken by their word, either verbal or in writing. They are corrupt and have no integrity.

Time expired.

The SPEAKER - The question is that leave be granted.

Mr Abetz - I'm still going through them.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=278.2_D=19.8_C=0.66] The SPEAKER - I will make sure before the end of the MPI that we still can do it, but it usually is a lot quicker than this, honourable Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - It's three pages.

The SPEAKER - I will allow the member's question at the end of the MPI.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=299.6_D=5.4_C=0.81] 

[11.30 a.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Attorney-General) - Honourable Speaker, I'm more than happy to reflect upon the matter of public importance put forward by Labor today and do not concede or consent in any way, shape, or form with the allegations put by the Deputy Leader for the Labor Party in this House earlier today and in the few moments prior to my rising. These are clearly allegations to besmirch the reputation of the Minister for Sport, and indeed the government. We don't accept the characterisation and the allegations that you have made. 

This is coming from a Labor opposition that is currently in administration. This is coming from a party that is beholden to and taking advice, directions, and instructions from Canberra. This is the credibility of the Labor opposition to come forward in the week after the budget Estimates with these allegations; it is not in keeping with due process. We still have not had an alternative budget from state Labor. This has been ongoing. They've confirmed today that that's not happening. The minister concerned has made it very clear he sees a future for the North Launceston Football Club. He's made commitments in that regard. He's made commitments to the fact there's an annual general meeting this week. He's identified the fact he's recently met with the president and he's doing the hard work that's required of the minister. We don't accept that in any way, shape, or form.

With respect to the efforts of our government regarding integrity and the efforts to reform these systems in Tasmania, it's very substantial. I've had meetings and provided briefings across the parliament in terms of our Integrity Commission reforms and they're a very substantial, large body of reforms. In terms of integrity, we're getting on with the job. We've tabled, as you know, through you, Deputy Speaker, the mandatory notifications legislation to strengthen our response to the commission of inquiry. We have 191 recommendations that have been made and we're in the process of implementing those recommendations. 

In addition to that, we're responding to the honourable William Cox review and his report and recommendations, and I've already committed, on the public record, to our plan to release that draft legislation for comment over the summer period and into early next year. That will include not just the commission of inquiry report and recommendations part thereof, but the Cox review and part of that, as well as the Weiss review, which the government's already on the record of committing to, particularly with respect to police and police investigations. We're getting on with the job. We've got a very large body of reform agenda in terms of integrity, in terms of being open and transparent and we're getting on with it. I've been in briefings in recent weeks with members of the crossbench. I've offered briefings to all in this place and indeed upstairs, with respect to the legislative agenda, so we're getting on with it.

I do want to take the opportunity to congratulate on the record Robert Hay KC, the new Chief Commissioner of the Integrity Commission. I thank him for his commitment and to his hard work and his future hard work for and on behalf of the Integrity Commission. It's a very senior appointment and I look forward to that. More recently, of course, public consultation in terms of RTIs and in terms of the ministerial diaries with respect to disclosures and progressing in that regard: we haven't heard much from the Labor opposition whether they wish to be part of that process in terms of transparency measures. What does the Labor opposition say about their diaries and the transparency for disclosing shadow ministerial diaries? It will be interesting to hear their contribution, perhaps during this debate today on the matter of public importance, because that's a commitment we've given as a government to doing more in this space and we're getting on with the job.

Time expired.

[11.35 a.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I start by saying what we've heard here this morning and in budget Estimates about minister Duigan's conduct is deeply concerning. The minister's been caught red-handed punishing a community organisation simply for looking to make sure their future would be secured regardless of who formed government. It really is an indictment on this minister that he won't just apologise and stump up. If he had integrity, that's what he would do. It's an indictment on this government and on the Premier that there hasn't been an intervention to make sure that that happens.

Unfortunately, this isn't the first time we've seen the political weaponisation of taxpayer money by this government. We've seen pork barrelling by this government at a gross scale at successive elections. We've seen money secretly awarded to organisations without any proper process, seemingly purely because of the personal relationships involved. There's also a range of outstanding questions about the integrity of members of this government. 

We know that there are two longstanding Integrity Commission investigations into MPs and these have dragged on for three years. In fact, the Integrity Commission recently confirmed that one of these investigations had been delayed because the MP under investigation told the commission that they couldn't have access to their records due to parliamentary privilege. That is remarkable. As the commission has pointed out, even Adam Brooks - or Terry Brooks, it might have been - cooperated fully with their investigations into him. Now we have an MP who has apparently refused to do the same. We have to wonder what that MP is trying to hide. Did they make that decision based on legal advice? If so, did the taxpayer cover that legal advice? We sure hope not, but who knows? What we do know is that the taxpayer has paid for hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal fees for government MPs.

There is a complete lack of transparency about who this money is being spent on or why it is being spent. In trying to get to the bottom of this issue in budget Estimates, the Greens asked every minister if they'd been involved in Supreme Court matters and if they had received taxpayer funds to cover their legal fees. Despite some attempts from Mr Jaensch at interfering with those questions, we actually got straight answers from almost every single minister. It's a rare occasion that you get a straight answer in this place but, in this case, we did across the board, with one notable and concerning exception. 

Every other minister engaged with our questions and provided answers, but minister Howlett completely refused to do so. This refusal begs the question: why? Why is minister Howlett unable to say whether she's involved in Supreme Court proceedings? Every other minister clearly said that they were not. Surely, she would say the same if there was nothing to see here. Why won't minister Howlett tell us if she's had legal fees covered by the taxpayer? It's public money, its public interest, but no answers. 

There's no justification for not answering these questions, as shown by the example set by other ministers, in particular minister Ogilvie. Minister Ogilvie was in the awkward position of having to admit that she'd had some of her legal fees paid for by the taxpayer, yet she didn't dodge the question: to her credit. We don't know why she's had these costs covered and we call on the minister to provide that information. At least she fessed up to the basic fact, there was some transparency, and it was welcome. This is public money, and the public has a right to know. Instead, Tasmanians are still being kept in the dark. 

The Greens are really concerned about this lack of transparency because, in our experience, when the Liberals are trying to hide something, when the Liberals are playing secret squirrel, there's usually something to worry about. That's why we are saying that minister Howlett should answer these questions. Has she been the subject of, or a party to, a Supreme Court matter? Has she had legal fees covered by the taxpayer? 

It's why we're calling on the government to provide the bare minimum of transparency by giving us the full list of MPs who have had the taxpayer fund their lawyers, how much has been spent on each of them, and the reasons why. 

Members - Hear, hear.

[11.39 a.m.]
Mrs GREENE (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, the most important currency that a minister holds is integrity, but the behaviour of the honourable member for Windermere, Nick Duigan, that we have witnessed shows that he has none. Tasmanians deserve a minister who is up to the job, not someone who is out of their depth in a car park puddle. 

The Minister for Sport, the honourable Nick Duigan, has admitted to withdrawing $100,000 of funding from the North Launceston Football Club, not because the club failed to meet eligibility criteria, not because of governance issues, not because of merit or community need or fairness, but because they had the audacity to meet with Labor during the election. 

Let's call it for what it is: it was political retribution, it was punishment, intimidation and it was vindictive. It was a message to every organisation in this state that this government will only fund you if you abide by their political rules. That is disgraceful and it's an abuse of power. Every Tasmanian should be furious. I tell you that the players and the club members at North Launceston Football Club are furious. A commitment made in writing after months of discussions with the club gone in a flash because club president, Adrian Hall, met with Labor during the election. If that is not political punishment, then what is? If that is not ministerial misconduct, then what is?

North Launceston is not just any club. It's one of Tasmania's most historic and successful sporting institutions. For 103 years, it has called York Park home. It has supported young people, families, volunteers and community pathways. Its contribution to health, connection and pride cannot be overstated. Apparently none of that matters to the honourable member for Windermere. In his world, what determines whether a club gets support isn't need or community value or fairness, it's whether they can stay safely within his political good-books. That is not democracy, that is not integrity, and that is not how government funding should ever work.

He even said in Estimates that he doesn't know what the club wants. Well, here's the kicker - and the part that would almost be funny if it wasn't so ridiculous. His office is right across the road. He could pick up the phone, he could walk across the road, but he hasn't done that. He did meet with them last week. About time. I'm sure that was very welcome by the club. I met with them earlier in the week and they were pretty unhappy when I met with them.

The people that he financially kneecapped are directly in his line of sight from his office. He can see the impact of his decision from his desk window. He must be too ashamed to go outside. I would be because the people who he has punished are his neighbours. 

Sport is meant to unite our communities. It's meant to transcend politics, but the Minister for Sport has dragged community sport into the gutter of partisan payback, sending a message to every club, every league, every association across Tasmania that if you meet with the wrong people then your funding might disappear. If funding can be taken away from a respected community institution with a century-long legacy just because they're meeting with the wrong people, then who is next? Which business, which school, which community organisation, which council, which citizen? What kind of government does that? What kind of minister thinks that this is acceptable behaviour? I will tell you: a minister who is out of his depth. A minister who has no business controlling public funding and no business sitting in the Cabinet.

Let me make it crystal clear: he should resign and if he will not resign, then the Premier should remove him because this is not just the failure of one minister, this is the failure of leadership from Premier Jeremy Rockliff.

If the Premier truly cared, he would do something about it. We challenged him to do that this morning - to have an investigation. If he truly believed that taxpayer money should be used for communities rather than to enforce political obedience, he would not tolerate this behaviour for one single day. 

I look forward to the honourable member for Bass, Michael Ferguson's contribution on this because I hope that he will do the right thing for the club. I really hope that he will. I hope that Rob Fairs and Bridget Archer do the same because this is a matter of integrity. It is very important.

Time expired.

[11.44 a.m.]
Mr GEORGE (Franklin) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, the opposition's allegations surrounding the North Launceston Football Club are deeply troubling and I'm glad they've been raised. They deserve much deeper examination. Speaking as a new member of parliament, I have great hope that this government can be held to account during this term of parliament on issues of transparency, corruption and maladministration. It's one of the many reasons that I'm looking forward to 2026 and beyond.

This is, or it should be, the advantage of a democratically elected minority government that can be held to account on the Floor of the parliament. This will eventuate if and when the opposition party gets over its disappointment that the Greens and the entire Independent crossbench made the carefully considered decision not to deliver Labor the Treasury benches.

Between us, we could achieve much to hold this government to account on a range of issues beyond just the notorious behind-the-closed-doors deals and the punishment of organisations and individuals who dare to collaborate with parties and people that the government doesn't approve of. Before that can happen, Labor needs to reach out to the crossbench and find ways to collaborate with the crossbench, including the Greens. We're not the enemy and between us we have the power to pursue policies and issues of mutual interest -

Ms Haddad - What do you say to all the collaboration that's already happening?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order. The member will be heard in silence.

Mr GEORGE - It's not happening.

Ms Haddad - What about all the things we are collaborating on? We've been in the same meetings, Peter.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order. Go ahead, Mr George.

Mr GEORGE - Together, we can and we will make changes in 2026. I have to give, unfortunately, credit to the government on this, because they've made genuine attempts to reach out and to collaborate with the crossbench - from appointing a very active liaison individual to meetings with the Premier, along with meetings and updates with individual ministers on a relatively regular basis.

These are things that we can do together, but you guys, the opposition, need to make the effort to reach out to us, and that's what we have been waiting for.

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order.

Mr GEORGE - Between us, we can drive reforms that will lead to greater integrity, transparency and accountability that are now belatedly on the table. We can hold the government to account on the Integrity Commission, the RTI Act, the Ombudsman, and ministerial diaries. We can work on that together, but we have to reach out across the floor to hold this government to account.

I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who believes that Tasmanians have trouble with the government, and there's a very long record to support that contention. I think the opposition's allegations about the North Launceston Football Club deserve much closer scrutiny and much more government transparency. The idea of a club or any organisation that can be punished because it doesn't toe the line is only too credible in Tasmania, under this government. I regret to say that I have witnessed such retribution myself, and it's deeply troubling.

I urge the opposition to spend energy to reach out to the crossbench, if it truly wants to change the Tasmanian democratic dynamic, and not be perceived as part of a Labor-Liberal coalition in thrall to the corporates.

We can make 2026 a great year for open, democratic, transparent government to the benefit of our state and to all Tasmanians, along with holding the government to account. 

[11.48 a.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak to the MPI, and in particular, the subject matter that has been pejoratively written up by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, who wants everybody to refer to her as a champion. That was a corruption in integrity, all that inflammatory language. I think we now know why, because the member for Bass, Mrs Greene, has just, I think for the first time by a Labor member, said that a minister should resign. How appalling. How appalling that, without any sense of fairness or honesty as to the truth of the matter, who said what and when -

A member interjecting.

Mr FERGUSON - You were listened to in silence.

Who said what and when, and with any sense of decency in a respectful workplace of using some basic level of fairness around evidence that you would do that.

For a start, I support the North Launceston Football Club and its aspirations to have a home and a club room. It shouldn't be beyond question. I think that the minister has been exceedingly clear about it as far back as February of this year - well before the winter election - that the government would work with the club. So he should, and so should the government. He's honouring that written pledge to work with the club.

I understand that there have been two letters tabled before the House today, and the one I've just described is the one that was signed by the minister as minister, not in a caretaker period. A second letter has been tabled, which the Labor Opposition today is referring to as a funding commitment that was later withdrawn. 

Ms Haddad - Yes.

Mr FERGUSON - Yes, says the shadow attorney-general with an unwise interjection, because it wasn't signed and it was known as a draft.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr FERGUSON - You can interrupt and be rude and show us how uncomfortable you are when you're being called out. Using those words 'corruption' - 

Members interjecting.

Mr FERGUSON - The loudest of those voices from a member - 

Members interjecting.

Mr FERGUSON - Listen to them. This is the sound of an opposition that's exposed for their untruthful behaviour. During Question Time today, the minister was misquoted. I find that shameful. You then expect crossbench members, and the public and the listening media, to take your version of events.

Mr Winter - What was the misquote?

Mr FERGUSON - What was the misquote? Alright, Mr Winter, leading with your chin again. The misquote? Here's the misquote - and it makes me angry, on behalf of a minister who's not even a member of the House, to defend himself, but I will. He's a good man and he has honour and integrity. The misquote was when your team - I don't know if the opposition acting leader said it. Your colleague, Mrs Greene, did. I wrote it down - 

Members interjecting.

Mr FERGUSON - I wrote it down. Listen to the answer.

Ms Finlay - So you don't know who you're quoting - hilarious. Who said it?

Mr FERGUSON - Stop being so rude, and listen.

The SPEAKER - Order. Ms Finlay, you're warned. You've got your second warning.

Mr FERGUSON - I wrote it down. Quote: 'The minister has admitted to withdrawing $100,000 of funding'. I wrote it down when you said it. 

Members interjecting.

Mr FERGUSON - It's what you said, Ms Greene. 

Mrs Greene - It was in a letter. 

Mr FERGUSON - We're talking about an unsigned letter.

Members interjecting.

Mr FERGUSON - Look at how you're breaking down.

The SPEAKER - Order. There are far too many interjections in this Chamber. I ask that the honourable member for Bass be heard, please.

Mr FERGUSON - They have been exposed for misleading the House. Do you know, Speaker, that the Standing Orders on misleading don't apply to ministers? They apply to every member of this House. They apply to you, Ms Finlay, they apply to you, Mrs Greene, and they apply to me. They apply equally. We cannot mislead this House. 

As for the letter being sent by the minister's chief of staff, I understand that's not true either - but it's good decoration for your allegation. I understand that the draft letter was sent during the campaign by a person who would one day become the minister's chief of staff.

Members interjecting.

Mr FERGUSON - And you laugh -

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr FERGUSON - Yet you make these serious claims. You are a disgrace. 

[11.53 a.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I could use the same tone as the member for Bass in this contribution, but I won't actually. It really doesn't justify the sort of attacks that we've just heard from the disappointed, disaffected backbencher, member for Bass Mr Ferguson, whose contribution then attempted to make this again about the Labor Party. The facts are clear and they were tabled by the deputy leader of the Labor Party earlier. 

There was a letter that was sent by Amanda Lovell to the President of North Launceston Football Club. Is that untrue? You stop me when I'm saying something that might be untrue, Mr Ferguson.

Mr Ferguson - I will try not to be as rude as you were 

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable member for Bass, the honourable member for Franklin has the call. I encourage the honourable member for Franklin to make all comments through the Chair, please.

Mr WINTER - Through you, Honourable Speaker. On 3 July 2025 at 1.08 p.m. exactly, a draft letter was sent to the president of the North Launceston Football Club, Adrian Hall.

Hi Adrian,

Sharing as discussed with Nick Duigan

Kind regards,
Amanda

That's the email that arrived. Then the letter, in writing, to the club outlining that the Liberal Party would commit to $100,000 to sort out a future for the North Launceston Football Club - in writing. When I spoke to Mr Hall ahead of Estimates, Mr Hall fully expected that commitment was still there. The reason I asked the question was to make sure it was actually happening. No-one was more surprised at the answer given by Mr Duigan than I was. Frankly, I was shocked when he said the answer. Here's what I asked. I said, 'Can you confirm that before the election you provided a draft letter to the president of the North Launceston Football Club, Adrian Hall, that included: 

I'm pleased to advise that a re-elected Tasmanian Liberal government will commit $100,000 to enable design and planning work to be undertaken around a proposed new facility for North Launceston Football Club. 

'Is that the case?' I asked the minister. He said, 'Yes.' So, I said, 'You provided a draft letter but not a final signed letter - so is the government committed to providing that $100,000 towards the upgrade, or not? 

Mr Duigan said:

I believe Mr Hall, shortly after I sent him that letter, went out and stood next to you, as you provide an alternative for him and, on the basis of that, I chose not to sign the letter.

Their commitment was there, in writing, and because he then went and stood with Labor, they pulled the money. They pulled the cash - not for any reason of policy or reason of a future for the club. They pulled it because he did media with Labor.

The club, and Mr Hall, fully expected, when I spoke to him ahead of Estimates, that the club was still being funded with $100,000. The reason I asked the question was to check it for him. The answer I got back was that no, they'd pulled the funding. They pulled the funding because he did media with Labor. It is disgraceful.

The member for Bass, in one of the few things he said that was accurate, was around the accuracy of statements that need to be made in this place. What he didn't say, though, is that ministers are held to account by a code of conduct for ministers. The code of conduct for ministers is very clear: fairness of decision making, on page 7, for most of you who probably haven't read it, including the Premier.

Ministers must take all reasonable steps to observe relevant standards of procedural fairness in decisions made by them. Such decisions are to be unaffected by bias or irrelevant considerations.

An irrelevant consideration is the fact that they did media with Labor, and because he did media with Labor, the government has now pulled the funding for that club. Why is the club homeless? Because the government forgot to include the North Launceston Football Club, that has been there for 100 years, in the York Park plans for the future. They spent $130 million on that facility and forgot the key tenant. Now they have no future at that site.

Here's the future for them, and here's the real issue and why it affects people at the North Launceston Football Club and participation in sport all over Bass. Because this hasn't been funded in this year's Budget, I don't see how the timelines work to actually give that club a future when they are kicked out of York Park. That is something that will affect young people, young players, everyone at that club. One of the most successful, famous clubs in Tasmania lost its funding because they did media with the opposition. Shameful.

Then the approach to come in here and say that, actually, it's Labor's fault, not just by the member for Bass, Mr Ferguson, but also by the Independent member for Franklin, to turn this into a Labor thing. This is a clear, cut and dried issue of integrity, where a breach of the code of conduct has been made by a minister; and we have a Premier who will not stand up to his ministers and will not uphold his own code of conduct for ministers.

Time expired.

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Treasurer) - Honourable Speaker, the Labor Party is proposing that the minister ought to resign on the basis of an unsigned draft. An unsigned draft -

CONDOLENCE MOTION

Honourable Gill James AM

[12.00 p.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) (by leave) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House expresses its deep sadness at the death on the 24 May 2025 [Bookmark: _Hlk215576282]  of the Honourable Gillian Hilma James AM, the first woman Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly from 1979 to 1980; first woman Minister of the Crown from 1980 to 1982; and a member of the division of Bass from 1976 to 1989 and 1992 to 2002; and places on record its appreciation of her service to this state; and, further, that this House respectfully tenders to her family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

It is a great privilege for me to be standing here today to celebrate and honour the life and contribution of the Honourable Gill James AM, Tasmania's first female Cabinet minister in the history of our parliament. 

In doing so, Speaker, I acknowledge her son, Ken, in the Chamber with us today. You have our deepest sympathies. How proud you must be of the contribution of your dear mum. For all the words we can use to describe her - commitment to community; work ethic; but also, clearly, a trailblazer and a leader and a role model for women in Tasmania, women in politics and women in our community - I have no doubt that the contribution of your dear mum has inspired many to be not only standing for politics but contributing to their community.

What an outstanding achievement we speak of today, and one that will never be surpassed.

Gill passed away on 24 May this year at the age of 90 and, again, to her family and friends, my deep condolences. Not only was Gill a trailblazer for women and a person who was deeply respected across politics, she was a friend, an advocate for workers and veterans, and a quiet achiever.

Since the 1960s, Gill was an active advocate for ex-service personnel, appearing before the Veterans Review Board and Social Security Appeals Tribunal to secure what they were entitled to. 

Gill remained a champion for her community her whole life, serving not just as a member for Bass for 23 years, but also as patron of many well-known organisations including the Tasmanian chapter of the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club, the Launceston Art Society, the Northern Tasmanian Netball Association, the Huntington's Disease Association and the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia Launceston sub-branch.

She also helped establish Launceston's first shelter for homeless men during the 1980s and was awarded the National RSL Certificate and Badge of Merit and made a life member of the RSL in 2003. She was appointed a legatee for Legacy. 

Gill was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1990, received Honourable for life in 1997 and was later introduced into the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women.

Gill was born in Launceston and educated at St Helens Primary School and Launceston State High School. She was married in 1961 and had one son, her beloved Ken, who we also honour today. I understand that even today, Gill is the longest serving female member of the House of Assembly since women first won the right to stand for parliament in 1921.

Prior to entering parliament, Gill worked in the offices of former president of the Senate Justin O'Byrne; and former deputy prime minister, Lance Barnard.

In 1979, Gill was the first woman to be appointed as a presiding officer - Deputy Speaker. Then, in 1980, as I said, she became the first woman to become a Cabinet minister, with the responsibility for public and mental health, consumer affairs and administrative services.

A few years ago, in 2022, the member for Launceston, Rosemary Armitage spoke very eloquently about Gill in the upper House to mark International Women's Day and had this to say: 'Gill has been regarded as one of the state's best grassroots politicians, and despite coming from a family of Liberals,' I understand, 'formed her own Labor-aligned views.' She also said that, after so much work in her community for veterans, Gill became known as 'Mrs Fix-It', and that 'her hard work at the coalface getting positive outcomes for the people who needed them made her a force to be reckoned with. Quiet, unassuming, not necessarily high profile, but very well loved'.

I also know former Speaker, Michelle O'Byrne, held Gill in very high regard, saying she 'remained glorious in her later days defending and advocating for those who needed her'. Michelle and I spoke about politics a lot, but also about people who influenced our careers, and certainly Gill was one who had a big influence on Michelle and her aspirations.

Mr Ferguson, a member for Bass, also paid tribute to the loss of a 'true old-school advocate for workers and veterans', and reflected that the 'whole community has lost someone special'. Very kind words, Michael, thank you. I can imagine Gill being here today in this parliament, still very much holding to those values, still fighting for people and injustice, and still giving her all to help others.

I have been a student of politics for many, many years. I often sat at school and read newspapers - editorials, opinion pieces - and I developed a passion and love for politics and an interest in all sides of people's views and what drives them to parliament. I cannot remember many, as I read through newspapers and things at the time in the Tasmanian State Parliament in the era of Gill James, but for some reason I remember Gill James. She was always there, speaking very passionately, but always in those pages surrounded by community and surrounded by the people she was advocating for so strongly. That's my memory of Gill, as a student of politics and it is etched in my mind. Notwithstanding, of course, her retirement and other areas of Gill's contribution, I was made aware of her trailblazing for women in politics and her very strong grassroots advocacy as well.

Having entered parliament in 2002, just after Gill's contribution, I know that, should Gill have continued in parliament, I would have learned a lot about grassroots politics from her as well. She may well have had some empathy for me, given her 'supposed' family background of Liberals - maybe. Nonetheless, we need more Gills in parliament and in public life. 

Can I say, Ken, it's lovely to have you here today. You will listen to people speak eloquently and true as to their views of how Gill influenced the community and indeed individual lives as well. When you do so, I know you will do so with a great deal of deserved pride and admiration for the contribution of your mother in this place and, most importantly, in her local community.

Again, my sincere condolences to all those that knew and loved Gill. Vale, Gill James.

Members - Hear, hear.

[12.10 a.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, today we honour the life and the legacy of Gill James AM, a woman who made history in this parliament, and did so with a spirit that was as cheeky as it was courageous. Whenever Gill was in a room, everyone knew about it. Her smile, her colour, her energy could not be ignored. Gill, as she was known to many of us, had a number of extraordinary achievements: breaking barriers for women in politics, championing veterans, and helping establish Launceston's first homelessness shelter for men. She was honoured as a Member of the Order of Australia and inducted into the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women. 

Perhaps her greatest legacy is the path that she paved for others, showing that leadership could not only be bold, but it could be glamorous and deeply human. Gill was a trailblazer, and that word's been used so often today and in recent conversations. It's used throughout every excerpt describing the most wonderful Gill James, and it's true. I think it's true that Gill was as cheeky and glamorous, she was utterly fearless, and she never lost her fire. The first woman to serve as a Cabinet minister in Tasmania. Just imagine that - imagine what that would have been like. It says so much about who she was. The first woman Presiding Officer - a woman who made history and absolutely did it in style. 

Premier, you mentioned the fond relationship between former Speaker, Michelle O'Byrne, and Gill James. I was in attendance at the funeral, and I felt the warmth and the deepness of the relationship. I know one of the things that I learnt that day about your mother was that she was often seen driving around Launceston in a sports car. That's something that Michelle referred to on the day. If I have my memory correct, something that I remember is that not only did she drive around in a sports car, but often she might actually relieve the ministerial driver and drive the car up and down the highway. I love that and what it says about a person.

Not only did she make history, but throughout her entire life, she remained active, right into her last years and her last weeks. She continued to defend and advocate for those who needed her. She was an incredible storyteller, and she continued to tell stories with that great sparkle in her eye. One of the things that's been recounted is that even in her final weeks she was delighted by the outcome of the then-federal election and still debating the politics with passion. I feel sad to say, Premier, but she was fiercely Labor. She may have grown up in a Liberal household, but there was no way she was aligned with your side of the house.

Honourable Speaker, it's actually a privilege to stand and speak to this motion on behalf of the Labor Party. It's an honour to be able to do it in the presence of Ken and it's something that for many of us, has actually provided the opportunity for us to be here. Today we honour one of the greatest true believers, Gillian Hilma James. She led a life of service, particularly to ex-service personnel, and again right up until her last moments, she was honoured and thanked. There was an immense amount of gratitude by many of the ex-service men and women that she had supported and their families.

Born in 1934 to a conservative-leaning family, Gill's childhood growing up in the north-east in St Helens and then being in Launceston, exposed her often to social injustices and disadvantage. That's what ultimately led her to devote her working life to community and to Labor. Gill's first job in politics was at the ripe old age of 19 as an electorate secretary to the Labor Senator Justin O'Byrne. In 1963, she joined Lance Barnard's office, initially as Mr Barnard's personal secretary, before becoming his head of office and most trusted confidant. Gill was by his side as he rose. As Lance became the president of the Tasmanian branch of the ALP, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, and ultimately the Deputy Prime Minister in the Whitlam government, you can only imagine the extraordinary conversations and opportunities that they had as they worked side-by-side and the decisions, the impact that Gill was party to during those history defining years for our party and for our country.

In Gill's words, reflecting on her experiences with Lance Barnard, I'd like to provide some quotes direct from Gill. We travelled all over Australia, more than Gough Whitlam. Lance set out to bring Labor to government. We went to every tiny outback town imaginable. I was the scout who found out how people really felt about things. They wouldn't tell him.

Then, once in government, Lance took on 13 ministries and Gough 14. People were constantly shuffling in and out of the office to get things signed and to get things done. That Labor government changed more in a short time than was changed before, or has been since and Gill James was there. She was a part of it, and no doubt she was leading it.

The incredible Gill James then set out about making her own history here in this place. Gill was first elected to the Tasmanian parliament in the 1976 state election as the first woman ever elected in Bass. She was the only woman elected to the Tasmania parliament in that 1976 election. She recalled later that one of her big responsibilities upon being elected was to record key points in the debate for the Premier because this was an era before Hansard and she was the only member of caucus proficient in shorthand.

On the Parliament House website there's a photo of this Chamber taken in November 1977, and you are immediately drawn to Gill's bright, smiling face, dressed all in white, amid a Chamber of men in tan and grey suits. That is the glamour of Gill James. I wonder if, when that photo was taken, Gill could have imagined a day like now, where women make up very close to half of all the members of the Tasmanian parliament.

Upon being elected, Gill quietly but defiantly set about breaking through the glass ceilings in this place and with the images that I have of her in her sports car, I like to imagine that she's not breaking through glass ceilings, but that she's smashing them through in her sports car. In 1979, she became the first female presiding officer as chair of committees before becoming Tasmania's first female Cabinet minister in 1980. 

She wasn't just eased into Cabinet with a junior ministerial role; she was loaded up with portfolios. Public and mental health, consumer affairs and administrative services, and as Tasmania's first female minister, the formidable Gill James' elevation to Cabinet naturally captured a lot of attention and with it, unexpectedly, some thinly veiled chauvinism. One of her political opponents described her appointment to the challenging Health ministry as a kiss of death. Premier Doug Lowe said that it would force her out of Cabinet within 12 months. Well, I'm going to quote Gill again -

I was delighted with the member's terminology that Mr Lowe, the Premier, had given me the kiss of death. I was kissed by many Liberals after the election and have received many calls from doctors in Launceston. I'm very glad to have the Health ministry and if none of the past ministers have made an impact, I'm about to start.

I love that, I love the cheeky, I love the confidence and I love that she was just in there to have a go. Gill remained in Cabinet for the remainder of the Lowe and Holgate governments before becoming a senior member of the Labor Opposition where she continued to make history in becoming Tasmania's longest-serving female MP.

In the 1989 state election, Gill lost her seat by only 150 votes, but rather than lament her misfortune in not being a part of another Labor government, she dusted herself off, kept working in the community and achieved one of the all-time greatest comebacks in Tasmanian politics, not only winning back her seat at the 1992 election, but topping the polls for Bass, and that's what I love about Gill James, the determination.

Gill described her comeback as going from a rooster to a feather duster and then back to a rooster again. She continued to serve in this chamber for a further decade, eventually retiring in 2002 after a remarkable 23 years representing the people of Bass. Never one to crave the spotlight, Gill always credited her electoral success to the work she did in community helping people. In a newspaper article in 1998, she said that she couldn't remember the last time she was interviewed on television and that she deliberately avoided the media. 'If they're chasing me or I'm chasing them, I can't be attending to the people who actually need me', she said. 'I don't need to make a big noise; I've got my grassroots support.' 

A very large part of that grassroots support, came from the extraordinary work Gill James did with war veterans, war widows and their families. Over a lifetime of public service, Gill will always be remembered as much for her work with servicemen and women and their families as her time in this place. With a husband and a brother who had both done national service and a stepfather who was an ex-army man, Gill's work with veterans began when she was in Lance Barnard's office. In 1967 she was appointed as an official representative before the Veterans' Review Board, and Mr Barnard's office became the place to turn to for vets and war widows in Launceston when they were needing help. 

Gill is thought to have assisted literally thousands of Tasmanian veterans and their families over the course of her career. Perhaps one of the most moving memories I have of her service was the Guard of Honour at the end of the service. It was moving, it was genuine and there was an absolute gratitude in that room for all that she had done for so many.

With no regard for electoral borders, she'd work with anyone who came into her office for help, poring over records for long hours and familiarising herself with legal and medical terminology. Some veterans would work with her for years in advocating for entitlements and pensions so that they could live the remainder of their lives out with dignity. She carried the responsibility seriously and personally. She described the veterans she represented as 'the people whose fates are still in my hands', and the community loved her for it.

Throughout her lifetime she was named patron and awarded honorary memberships and life memberships to many organisations, including veterans' clubs and associations, the RSL, the Launceston Totally and Permanently Disabled Soldiers Association, the Vietnam vets motorcycle club - so many organisations. She worked so broadly across the community.

The association's chairman at the time, Roy Johns, summed up Gill's approach when he said:

There are so many people who can't put their words together, who have a wonderful story but can't tell it. Well, she's been the one to tell the story for them. The widows, they worship her. She's a member of parliament, but that's not what they see her as. When the others are off socialising, she's in her office fighting for the rights of ex-servicemen.

Like so many working women, Gill balanced her public life with family life. I know that there is no greater bond than that between a mother and a son, and that must have been an amazing way to be raised and incredible to watch and be part of.

She loved yachting, she loved her cars and had a lifelong passion for speedboat racing, which I also love. In 1990, Gill was named as a Member of the Order of Australia and granted the right to use the title 'Honourable' for life. In 2005, she was inducted into the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women.

Gill James will be remembered as an icon of this parliament, an icon of our community, a legend of the Australian Labor Party, a trailblazer for women in politics and a tireless advocate for the people across our Tasmanian community. On behalf of our party and grateful Tasmanians, we honour her lifelong service and her memory and offer our deepest condolences. In this moment, we know that she will be watching down, smiling cheekily and wishing us all well. Today, we stand to honour her life and her legacy. Vale Gill James.

Members - Hear, hear.

[12.24 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to add my words of condolences to the family, friends and members of the Labor Party who knew and loved Gillian Hillma James - Gill James. I especially add our condolences, thoughts and full respect to Ken for all of his mother's life and what she contributed to the community.

She was the longest-serving woman member of the House of Assembly since women won the right to stand in this parliament in 2021. She was elected twice, as we've heard, from 1976 to 1989 and again from 1992 to 2002, but those facts hide the reality of what she achieved through her career. By her legacy she's shown what true community service looks like and we've heard a lot of examples. Gill was obviously a woman who never rested and devoted herself to standing up to injustice and calling it out and used her precious time on Earth to work for other people, and that is really evident in what she did.

She grew up, as we've understood, in a Liberal voting family, but in her teenage years she became lit with the passion of the policies of the Labor Party in the 1960s, which were really calling out injustice and crying out for change, so much so that she was successful when she was 19, just out of school, in getting a job with Labor Senator Justin O'Byrne. She left school, went to Canberra and went on the journey of federal politics, which is a massive step for a young Tasmanian woman from Launceston.

After the birth of Ken, her son, she was asked to work for a short stint with the deputy leader of the Labor Party, Lance Barnard, in 1962, but she was obviously so capable and effective - also maybe there was the Launceston bond, because I understand that Lance Barnard was also from Launceston; two Launcestonians in Canberra - and so respected that she remained with Lance Barnard until he left politics as then deputy prime minister of Australia in 1975.

Gill didn't stop there. She took the passion of the Whitlam era and what had been achieved at the national level and brought it to Canberra, and as we've heard, she stood and was successful in entering into Tasmanian politics in 1976. It was at a time when she used the energy of what was happening nationally with the feminist movement, with women, with the work that Julia Ryan did as the Labor first ever minister for women, and she came down to Tasmania and smashed through some of the many layers of glass that hold women back. There are still some more to smash and we're all doing our best to do that, but Gill has been there and was the first woman to become a Cabinet minister. As we've heard from Ms Finlay, the member for Bass, that would have been quite an awesome space to enter into and she didn't just take up a small job, she took up a massive job accepting the health and mental health portfolios as well as the consumer affairs and administrative services portfolios that we've heard about.

She also continued her work with the Labor Party and was for many years working with Lance Barnard when he was the deputy president of the Labor Party and then working here with the Parliamentary Labor Party when she was a member of parliament as the whip. She was also deputy chair of committees and held a number of other roles that were also firsts, so she was a woman who was not afraid of being out in front and she obviously carried with her a passion for why it was important to do that. 

She worked with Lance Barnard when he had the defence portfolio in Canberra from 1972 to 1975. In the contribution by Rosemary Armitage MLC, she talked about the fact that Lance Barnard had some Vietnamese orphans that he raised, so she was personally affected by returned servicepeople's experiences and by a connection with the Vietnamese community that galvanised her for the rest of her life in the work that she did for returned soldiers. 

She was a life member of the Vietnam Veterans Association and a patron of the Tasmanian chapter of the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club. Maybe other members can confirm whether she ever got on a bike. I reckon she probably did because it sounds like that's the sort of woman she was. She was also involved in a whole range of things, the Launceston Art Society, the netball association in northern Tasmania, Huntington's disease and we've heard a range of other things. I suspect it doesn't tap the depths of the things that she was involved in because she was a giver, no doubt about that.

She completed her 23 years of service to Tasmania, 23 years ago and - so many firsts for women. She walked where no woman had walked before. She opened doors that we women in the Chamber follow and other women will follow. We will push through other doors because we have Gill James, with all her energy, passion and spirit, in our back pocket, all of us. A place like Tasmania is better thanks to people like Gill James. We are grateful for the service she gave to Tasmania and Tasmanians.

Ken, I want to say, on behalf of the Greens, we can see your mother was very special, and she gave a lot and I'm sure she gave a lot to you, too. Her legacy will be enduring for the better. Vale Gill James.

[12.31 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Honourable Speaker, it's a great privilege to rise and join the Premier, the Deputy Leader for the Opposition, the Leader of the Greens and others in this place to pay a tribute to Gill James, pioneering Tasmanian, a trailblazer in Tasmanian politics, and a leader in health, housing, community services and the veterans' community. I acknowledge that up front. I want to acknowledge Ken in the Chamber today and, of course, pass on sincere condolences and best wishes to Ken and family, friends, former colleagues and all the communities that she represented in the seat of Bass and elsewhere around Tasmania.

Gill James is an outstanding woman and I had the privilege of getting to know her during the 1990s, but more specifically in the early 2000s when we started the campaign to support Teddy Sheean for his Victoria Cross. It was in those early years where there was little confidence in our campaign and our quest for a VC and for justice for Teddy and I wanted to pass on a special greeting and thanks from Garry Ivory, the nephew of Teddy Sheean VC, because he not only approached myself - and we worked together - he also approached Gill James, after her retirement in 2002. After those many long years as the longest serving woman in this parliament and the first minister in this parliament in Tasmania, which was already outstanding, she acted as a volunteer and she helped us through the bureaucratic maze, as it were, through the various tribunals that we wanted to approach. Gill James gave excellent advice to Garry Ivory and, indeed, myself and others and I wanted to acknowledge that.

I got to know Gill James as minister for Veterans Affairs and parliamentary secretary responsible to the then premier Will Hodgman. She was always standing up for those doing it tough. She stood up for the vulnerable and, specifically, the veterans and I wanted to acknowledge that today in this condolence motion because of my personal contact and friendship with Gill. We would meet at the RSL, Tasmania Launceston branch meetings and events from time to time. She was a wonderful supporter of Legacy.

Many in this House know my grandfather flew in the First World War and did much to support and get Legacy established in Tasmania, particularly in Hobart as president, and had other roles. Gill was a wonderful supporter of Legacy, particularly in Launceston, and caring again for the vulnerable, for those who couldn't help themselves. Gill James had that kindness of spirit, she was caring and she was always reaching out for other people.

Of course, she did have that wry smile and, I would say, cunning wit to get the job done and to find the way through on behalf of her constituents. I think the word formidable has been used and I concur with that remark.

She received the national RSL Certificate and Badge of Merit, which is a great honour, and honorary life membership from the RSL. She was a great supporter of the Vietnam Veterans. I have had many interactions with the Vietnam Veterans, I still do. They are a wonderful organisation, and Gill James was often at those meetings, or she would be supportive in different ways, shapes and forms during the 2000s - again, post her paid career in 2002 - and she was doing this as a volunteer. She was an advocate for the veterans, standing up for their entitlements, for income support and protection, and she did it for the vulnerable.

I met with and worked with Gill James from time to time when I was minister for Housing for a couple of years and she was, as has been indicated, standing up for the homeless and vulnerable Tasmanians in and around Launceston, not just the women, but the men. I think that's been noted in the remarks today and I want to again pay tribute to that because - caring for the vulnerable, the homeless, she certainly stood out. She was a quiet achiever, certainly as minister for health and mental health, and consumer affairs - all portfolios which I have held or now hold, so I can relate to her determination to not just be a poisoned chalice, but to make a real difference. She was a big reformer in the health space and mental health reform in that role. That should be acknowledged. I wanted to put that on the record.

The other area where we came across each other from time to time is in the area of support for people with motor neurone disease. My dad, as people in this place and elsewhere know, had motor neurone disease. Mum was involved as patron for the Motor Neurone Disease Association Tasmania and Gill James would come and support our association, our support group in Launceston. I'm clearly very grateful for Gill James' support and note the wonderful care and commitment she's given her community. She was a trailblazer - it should be acknowledged - and I can say a wonderful tribute for her life and legacy. Vale, Gill James.

Members - Hear, hear.

Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Honourable Speaker. I loved Gill James, she was a beautiful person, and it's a really important moment in this House for us as a collective, while not all able to speak, but for us as a collective, the members of the House of Assembly to pay tribute to such an assertive, remarkable, witty, kind, and successful member of this House. I'm very grateful for the fact that I, amongst others, knew her and appreciated what she brought to Tasmanian public life and to improving the lives of her constituents, with a primary focus on Bass, our northern Tasmanian community. She couldn't help but also be a force for good for people right around the state and, indeed, the nation. As a fellow member for Bass, I want to take this opportunity in speaking to this condolence motion. Thank you to the Premier for moving it. Thank you for the Deputy Leader for seconding it, or speaking to it, and others.

I want to thank the late Gill James AM for her service to this House and her service to the people of Bass and Tasmania over many years. It's been beautifully articulated by others already. I was very saddened to receive news in May of the passing of someone I encountered as a dear friend and former member of this House. Elected in 1976 - an altogether different era to the times that we're now living through. That was a groundbreaking moment, remembering it was within a year of the defeat of the Whitlam government, not just by the dismissal, but by the election that followed. That was a significant breakthrough moment for her personally and for her party here in Tasmania, which was elected in Tasmania despite the groundswell of Liberal support federally around Tasmania. Nonetheless, in Tasmania, Labor was returned in 1976 with Gill James' support. To note that she was the first-ever female Cabinet minister in our state is a tremendous honour for her and her side of politics. When I think of the achievements of Gill James, I immediately think of people like Sue Napier, who broke through the same kinds of barriers and achieved the same kinds of great successes as an eminent Bass politician who was also female. Notably, she was defeated at the 1989 election, where we saw the defeat of a Liberal government only by a single vote because of the Labor-Greens accord. That was the election where she was unsuccessful and many would have thought, 'Well that's the end of your time', but it wasn't to be.

The 1990 Queen's Birthday Honours List saw Gill honoured as a Member of the Order of Australia, and I note that that records it was not for service to the parliament but for service to the parliament and the community, a vital distinction, because the work she did as a parliamentarian, in my opinion, was the minority of the work she did as a public figure for Tasmania. As has been well described, for many years her work in the community, particularly but not only with veterans, TPIs and war widows, was something that was her life's work.

She was returned to this House in 1992 as, I think, a personal act of defiance against her defeat in '89. She topped the poll for Labor, and in 1992 to return for Labor at an election that the Liberals won was a big achievement. Remember, two sitting Labor members lost their seats. That's trailblazing if ever you heard of it. She was granted the right to use the title honourable for life in 1997 while still serving as a member of this House, which I think is a sign of the respect she enjoyed across the Chamber.

I would like to share the cheeky grin she always wore with that bright red lipstick, and she retired on her own terms in 2002. Few will admit it, but every member of this House wants to leave this House one day in just the same way - admit it. She retired on her own terms. She was the longest-serving woman of this House ever to date, and I personally suspect that that record will last a very long time - 23 years is a very long time. She was also inducted into the Tasmanian Honour Roll for Women in 2005.

I just want to speak for a moment personally. Despite our political differences, I can't remember us ever having a difference and we spoke many times. Our mutual love in particular for the members of the Good Neighbour Council of Northern Tasmania and enjoyment of the Friday get-togethers served as a wonderful place to really get to know each other well, as two MPs for Bass who did not serve at the same time. We would enjoy those times over some 20 years, and I can say with gratitude that our mutual respect ran deep and it always will. She was always beautifully dressed. I don't know so much about the sports car, but she had a lot of class and she wanted to look the part and she did. It was a way of enjoying life.

One of the major things we shared in common politically was our work as Health ministers. We both served as ministers for Health, and let me tell you, Speaker, Gill encouraged and supported me from the beginning. She was a terrific person and she was kind to me.

The Labor Party should be proud to count Gill James amongst its alumni. The Labor Party has lost a true old-school advocate for workers, for veterans, for the TPIs, for the widows and for the legatees, the children. She really was a quiet achiever. She was not a personality to seek credit, but she deserves all the credit we're pouring upon her life today.

That heritage that we reflect upon was adopted while working for other Labor luminaries including Justin O'Byrne, a prominent Tasmanian Senator at the time, and of course Deputy Prime Minister Barnard, who himself had had a long history in the electorate, following in his own father's footsteps.

Her funeral at Franklin Grove on 6 June was well attended. The tributes to her life were just as reflective, warm and uplifting as that beautiful autumn afternoon in northern Tasmania. It was beautifully presided over by Michelle O'Byrne, who was then our Speaker as well. The honour guard by the veterans was a very moving mark of respect and admiration that the veterans and that community in particular had for Gill. It really carried the honour and respect that the entire electorate and the broader community held her in and it was a beautiful display. 

Gill reached the glorious age of 90 and she kept that beautiful smile until the end. Her legacy is one of caring for people with a sense of true personal and lifelong dedication and making a difference in the lives of many Tasmanian people and their families.

As I close, I wish to pay particular thanks to Gill's family, because Ken, you and your late father and the late Peter, Gill's long-term partner, shared Gill with us, our Tasmanian parliament and our Tasmanian community. You may not have had much say in that, but you did it nonetheless, you shared her with us and the public. That is an extremely generous gift by the family and supporting, no doubt, Gill throughout all of those years. I particularly thank her family and offer my sincere condolences to them and all who loved her. Vale Gill James, may you rest in peace and thank you for your service to Tasmania. 

[12.47 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, something that is lovely about condolence motions is hearing such beautiful tributes to members across the political divide. To hear such touching words from the Premier, the Deputy Premier and the member for Bass show the connections that we build in this place. Sometimes that's not what the public sees when they see us fighting on the news, but to hear what a profound impact a member of the Labor Party had on the work of two currently serving Liberal members is really meaningful and I wanted to start my contribution by recognising that.

I also want to pay my respects to Gill James and to her son, Ken. Thank you for joining us here today in the Chamber, Ken, to be able to hear the words of many of the current crop of Tasmanian politicians and how much respect we had for your mum, Gill. She was, as we've heard others say, the first woman Cabinet member and the longest-serving female member of this House, and I agree with the member for Bass that 23 years is a remarkable level of service and I dare say that record will not be outdone anytime soon.

Gill was the first female Cabinet minister, later to be joined by others in the Labor Party, including Judy Jackson and Fran Bladel, and they are women who served in cabinets at a time when women weren't really expected to be there at all. She worked in the old federal Parliament House as a staffer to Lance Barnard at a time when women weren't expected to even be in that building as staff, let alone as members. 

I will tell a very short story of an event I attended in this place last week, a reading of a children's book called A Loo of One's Own, and thanks to some of the other members who supported that event. That was the story about the fact that when the first female members of the Australian Parliament were elected there were actually no female toilets in that building at all, a really tangible sign that women weren't expected to be there. Yet while those first female MPs who were elected had no toilets to go to, there were plenty of female staff in that building at that time, including Gill James. 

Those elected female members, one from each side of the political spectrum in each House of the Australian Parliament, went to many of those female staff members and said, 'What do you do?', and the answers were extraordinary. They would go home in their lunch breaks, or they'd walk five minutes to a building nearby to use the bathrooms, so we're literally talking about not only smashing glass ceilings but smashing porcelain bowls as well with the women who served in our parliaments in those early days of women first being elected to represent our communities. I will finish that anecdote by saying it was an astonishing 30 years before a female women's toilet was actually built in old Parliament House. Luckily they did remember to build some when the new Parliament House was built.

I want to recognise that the stories those early elected women in the Labor Party shared with those of us who have followed in their footsteps are really profound, and many of us would not necessarily have the opportunity to even be serving in this place if it wasn't for people like Gill, who told us stories about - we all kind of cop a bit in this place from the public, on all sides of politics, but it was so much more visceral for those early elected women. These were women who, even in an environment with no social media, were really derided and not taken seriously, yet made an enormous contribution not only to their communities but to this parliament and to the ministries that they served in. Without the contributions of Gill and those who joined her later, Fran and Judy, many of us might not even have been here.

I do want to recognise the really special connection that many in the Labor Party had with Gill, particularly Michelle O'Byrne. I know that Michelle would have really liked to have been here for today and, indeed, intended to be here for today's condolence motion and couldn't be due to travel commitments. She sends her fond regards to everybody here, and I know has already done that personally with Ken and Gill's family, and presided over the funeral earlier this year.

I think Gill's life and her legacy in this place are marked by her tenacity. The member for Bass, Mr Ferguson, mentioned it as well, that not only did she return after losing her seat, but she topped the poll. I think that is a really telling return to this place, that she wasn't willing to go down without a fight. She returned to this place and served for a significantly long period of time after that - all up serving the people of Bass for 23 years. 

Not only did she make extraordinary contributions to the ministerial portfolios that she held, but also to her community around, as we've heard, housing - a particular passion; the rights of returning servicemen and women, their widows and their children; and to working people across not just northern Tasmania but across the state and the country.

We're very lucky to be able to stand in this place and share our condolences with Ken and Gill's family, show our respects to an extraordinary woman who gave a huge amount to this place and to our state.

Members - Hear, hear.

[12.52 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, it is wonderful to hear those contributions to Gill. She was a giant of the Labor Party and the Launceston community. On a personal level, she was a very good friend of my sister Michelle, and a mentor to Michelle and many other young female aspirants to either political office or to social justice and social change. She was a friend of my mother, and she was a much-loved member of the Australian Labor Party Sisterhood in Bass.

Gill was a fan favourite amongst the rank-and-file members, not because she sought political office for personal power, but because she demonstrated her values by seeking political office to lift other people up. Her involvement in so many community organisations in Launceston, and her quiet impact, is profound - and it is still being felt today. You can just imagine, her life is essentially personified by service to others.

To drive, as a young woman in the late 1960s and 1970s, putting her hand up to work in political offices, travelling to Canberra - Senator Justin O'Byrne, who at that stage was the leader of the Senate. Also working with Lance Barnard, a significant figure in not only the Labor Party but in Australian politics in the 1960s and 1970s, and being witness and being present at all of the - We've heard all the stories of the 50th anniversary of 'the Dismissal'. Well, Gill was there. She was a part of that, and no doubt those Whitlam years impacted her theory of change about how she would effect change. Her decision to run in 1976 would have no doubt been impacted by the events of the Dismissal; the events of the 1972 election of the Whitlam Government and the massive social and economic change that that triggered.

It's no surprise to me that when Whitlam made the decision to bring the troops home from Vietnam, at that time Vietnam vets were not treated very well. I'm sure that had an impact on Gill's role in working with veterans, particularly Vietnam veterans - that they deserved better than the thanks this nation gave those veterans when they returned from the Vietnam War.

She survived the 1974 Bass by-election, when Lance made the decision to resign from federal parliament to take up an ambassadorial role. That was a very tough time to be Labor in Bass. That was a moment where my mother, when she was handing out how-to-votes in the 1974 by-election, was struck by a Liberal voter saying, 'How dare you offer me this how-to-vote for the Labor Party.' My mother replied - and I'm sure Gill would have echoed - 'I dare. I dare offer you this how-to-vote card.'

All of us across this Chamber feel the benefit of someone who valued grassroots connection, who respected community, who was there when it counted, and didn't just turn up for the election but turned up every day of every week to represent her constituents.

Tasmania is a far better place for Gill's service. Vale, Gill.

Members - Hear, hear.

[12.55 p.m.]
The SPEAKER - I, too, would like to rise and honour the extraordinary life and service of the honourable Gill James AM, a woman whose service, vision and lifelong commitment to community has left an indelible mark on Tasmania. I also, too, give my deepest condolences and sympathies to Gill's son, Ken James, in this Chamber today, her family, friends, loved ones, the Labor Party, and all who knew and loved Gill.

My godfather was John Treloggen, who was Gill's brother. As their houses backed on to each other in Gascoyne Street, Kings Meadows, growing up I saw Gill on many occasions, as I did John and Elaine and their children Joanne and Richard. Gill and her husband, Peter, and Ken lived just around the corner from where I, too, lived in Kings Meadows.

It says a lot about Gill's humility as a person that before I could vote, I sadly admit, I never realised she was an elected member of parliament. That's because I just remember Gill as a very smiley, kind, witty, very classy and lovely lady, who was always very happy to say hello and who did drive a very nice sports car.

It was only much later that I gained a true appreciation of what a great trailblazer Gill truly was, and the immense and important significance of Gill's many firsts for women: that Gill still remains the longest-serving woman member of this House; that Gill was the very first woman presiding officer in Tasmania; and that Gill was the very first woman minister in Tasmania.

Gill's long-term advocacy, her life serving others, and her outstanding patronage of many, many organisations continued long after Gill's retirement, ensuring that Gill's enduring contribution to Tasmania lives on.

Gill James's life reminds us all that true service does not end when we all leave this parliament. Our legacy can endure, evolve, and it can continue to shape the world around us for the better.

All of us in this Chamber are a richer and stronger community because of Gill's service and all of her efforts. So today, I join with you all in honouring Gill's service, celebrating Gill's legacy, and I, too, commit to carrying forward the spirit of dedication that Gill so profoundly embodied.

Vale, Honourable Gill James AM. We here in this Chamber, along with your family, friends, loved ones and all who knew and loved you, will remember you.

I now ask all members in this House to please signify their support by joining me in standing.

Motion agreed, nemine contradicente.

Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I further move -

That a copy of the foregoing resolution be forwarded to the family of the late Ms James.

Motion agreed to.

The House suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.


MINISTERIAL STATEMENT

RA Rodda Museum of Pathology - Coronial Investigation into Unauthorised Human Remains

[2.30 p.m.]
Mrs ARCHER (Bass - Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing) - Honourable Speaker, I rise today to update the House and the Tasmanian people on the government's response to the coroner's record of investigation and findings in relation to human remains retained following coronial autopsies between 1966 and 1991 at the RA Rodda Museum of Pathology in Hobart.

I want to start by acknowledging the deep hurt that this has caused, especially for the friends and family of loved ones affected by these historical practices. These revelations have been both traumatic and devastating and this has been made very clear to the government, both firsthand through meeting with those impacted and through other members of parliament. 

As members are aware, the coroner's report found that specimens taken during postmortem examinations were retained and exhibited in ways that disregarded the dignity, autonomy and cultural beliefs of individuals and communities. The coroner confirmed that between the 1950s and early 1990s, 177 specimens of human remains were retained without lawful authority or consent. To the family and friends of those individuals, we offer our deepest and most sincere apology. This abhorrent practice represented a profound breach of trust and a failure to uphold the ethical standards expected of health and research institutions. 

It is important to state that these actions occurred prior to the Coroners Act 1995 coming into effect. There are rigorous processes that have been implemented by the state forensic pathologist to ensure that this will never happen again. 

It is also important to make clear for the record that the Department of Health has advised that the three current forensic pathologists employed by the department were not involved in these historic matters. 

Given the horrific and unacceptable nature of these circumstances, it is very clear that more needs to be done to ensure that everyone involved is held accountable.

The Attorney-General has already written to both the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and Tasmania Police to make them aware of the coroner's report. I can confirm I have also instructed the Department of Health to undertake further work to establish, as far as is possible, the identity of any employees within the department during the period of the 1950s through to the early 1990s who may have been involved in the retention of remains without lawful authority or consent. 

While the coroner's report identified one individual, now deceased, as being primarily responsible for the unlawful retention of body parts and did not identify any others who may have been involved, it is important for the families that we do what we can to investigate further and if further information is found, to pass those details on to the appropriate authorities. As the coroner's report said:

It appears at this stage that now-dead forensic pathologist Dr Royal Cummings was the person who provided the large majority of coronial specimens to the museum. However, it also appears that his predecessors and successors also engaged in the practice.

Given these comments in the coroner's report, I have directed the department to review all available historical records and to engage with UTAS to establish any further information relating to the unlawful retention of specimens which can be provided to the relevant authorities for their consideration and potential action. 

I can also confirm that the government will facilitate a formal parliamentary apology on behalf of the state to appropriately recognise the immense harm caused. It is our intention for the formal parliamentary apology to be delivered in the first half of 2026, and I can assure everyone that the families of those affected will be closely consulted in its development. This formal apology is an important step for the parliament to acknowledge and apologise for the pain and trauma associated with these practices. 

It is important that we take care to coordinate and deliver this apology in a trauma-informed way, allowing families who wish to be present to be here and to allow members from all sides of parliament to participate. We will work with members of parliament to coordinate the timing and format of the formal apology and we thank those members from both Houses who have represented the concerns of the families and assisted families through the coronial process, which we know has been very difficult for families.

Honourable Speaker, as the Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing, I am very committed to ensuring the highest possible standards from my department. While we cannot change the past, it is vitally important that we learn from what has happened and ensure that we do all we can to hold those responsible to account, and that's exactly what we will be doing. I thank the House.

[2.36 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the Ministerial Statement be noted.

I would like to commence by also expressing my sincere sympathy and condolences for the grief and trauma experienced by families affected by this situation. I acknowledge the unimaginable pain that these distressing historical practices have caused and the profound shock of learning that the remains of their loved ones were taken and retained without their knowledge or consent. This harm has deeply affected individual families and has been felt across the wider community.

Families have been in touch with many of us across this parliament to express their distress. Certainly, I've heard from people even as recently as this morning, not in the context of today's ministerial statement, but just in the context of the coroner's report being released, that they remain very hurt and shocked to learn through media reports and public notices that their loved ones' body parts had been taken and retained. I know that others have found it very meaningful to hear from those families who have undergone compounding grief and distress as a result of that discovery.

I wrote to the Attorney-General about this issue on behalf of several constituents and I'm glad to know that he, as we heard in the Minister for Health's statement, has written to the Director of Public Prosecutions and Tasmania Police about the coroner's finding and that the Minister for Health, who we've heard from in this statement, has instructed her department to conduct further investigations to ascertain as much as possible the identities of employees within the department from the 1950s to the 1990s who may have been involved with this unlawful retention of remains. I think that's very pertinent because, as we heard from the minister, the coroner's report names one past staff member who likely was involved with this, but it's inconceivable to think there wouldn't have been others who were also involved.

I commend the minister and the government for progressing to a parliamentary apology. That is a very solemn and right obligation that we have as members of parliament to express that publicly to families affected on behalf of the decision-makers at that time.

I want to close my contribution by sharing a little bit of one of the deidentified emails I received from a family member affected. I've removed his name and some relevant dates so he can't be identified. He wrote specifically to request a committee of inquiry into this matter and said that in his case, he was visited in 1976 by Tasmania Police who came to his workplace to inform him of his father's death. He attended the Hobart Police Station shortly after and was escorted to the morgue to identify his father's body, and during that time he was informed of his father's cause of death. He wasn't asked whether his father had thought about donating organs and didn't sign any consent forms for organ removal. His father had requested cremation in earlier discussions while he was still alive and respecting his wishes, all of his ashes were scattered at sea following the funeral service.

Fast forward to 25 January 2025, and on page 50 of the Mercury is a notification from the coroner listing 126 deceased persons who were identified by the title coronial project, indicating that organ specimens were removed from those deceased persons without coronial authority, without next of kin knowledge nor approval, forwarded to the UTAS Rodda Museum, labelled with the donors' identity and information and displayed for public view for the next 40-odd years. He said:

Recognising my father's name listed, I was shocked and disheartened. A feeling of hollowness pervaded me for some days. It was a second grieving period.

He goes on to explain that he knows many other families have been affected and describes it as an abhorrent abuse by medical professionals including, but not limited to, pathologists and others at all levels during organ removal and specimen delivery stage. He said the Rodda Museum management and staff, again, at all levels, as the receivers and catalogues of these body parts in bottles who signed specimens out to the Royal Hobart Hospital and who accepted the specimens at the Rodda Museum during the 30-odd year period with no questions asked.

He finishes by saying that those deceased people affected left behind mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, daughters, sons, grandparents and grandchildren and we owe it to apologise to those families.

[2.41 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I want to thank the minister for Health for bringing this ministerial statement. It has been waited on for a long time by the affected families and I want to first recognise the families who were affected by what happened with the unlawful taking of parts of people that they have loved and describing them as specimens and putting them in bottles to be, as one family member put it, ogled at by other people for research or as a curiosity. People have spoken of their grief, shock, anger and trauma that they feel for not having this information and realising it was not something that only happened to them, it was systemic and it went on for decades.

The coroner has uncovered that, over 33 years, 177 individual samples of human remains were retained by the Rodda Museum at the University of Tasmania. That would be, I imagine, and people have talked about, extra hard to think it was a systemic practice. It wasn't an accident or a one-off, it was something that continued over decades. It was essentially normalised to unlawfully make decisions on behalf of grieving families, to take parts of the body of the person who died and to see it as an object for medical research without having a discussion with the families. It's utterly out of step with people's expectations today in Tasmania of how a grieving family should be treated. It is utterly out of step with the wider community and it sits particularly horribly with the families and other loved people of people who died.

It was quite clearly noted in Coroner Simon Cooper's report. He said:

The belated discovery that human remains were removed at autopsy and not returned to the body has been a source of pain and anger for many families.

The retention of human remains without family or coronial approval, or even knowledge, is a historic practice out of keeping with, and offensive to, contemporary standards and values. It is inconceivable to my mind that it would ever happen again although the fact that the practice continued for as long as it did and ended only comparatively recently is almost equally inconceivable.

It is important to make the point that the coroner's report noted that it was unlawful behaviour. It can't only be put down as an accident or a benevolent action. It was unlawful behaviour, as the report says:

There was no jurisdiction for a coroner to authorise the removal or retention of any part of a dead body for any purpose other than for investigating the manner and cause of death for that person. Similarly, any part of a dead body that had been removed and retained for legitimate coronial purposes should have been subject to a burial warrant in consultation with the family and replaced in the body prior to burial.

We know these things didn't happen. We obviously look forward to, and thank the minister for talking about making, a formal apology - something that has been discussed with all the families involved, so that people have time to know about that.

I end with saying it is a fair question that people want to have all the answers to the things that the minister raised. People want to have the confidence that can only be achieved by evidence that this could never happen again and that checks and balances are in place. That is important information for justice and healing.

[2.46 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the statement of my colleague and friend, the Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing, who's made this on behalf of the government.

I will also start by acknowledging the hurt, pain and suffering of many of the family and friends of loved ones affected by these historical practices. I acknowledge the trauma and the pain, and this has been made very clear to the government directly, to me and my office, the Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing, and to others. I acknowledge the feedback from members of parliament in this place: the member for Braddon who asked me the question about this not so long ago and the shadow attorney as well. Thank you for that, certainly to the family and friends of those individuals. Like the Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing, we offer our deepest and most sincere apologies.

As Deputy Premier, Attorney-General and minister for Justice, I've taken a series of steps to respond to these findings and to the concerns raised by families and members of this parliament. I've worked closely with the Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing, Bridget Archer. As the minister relayed, in the first half of next year the government will facilitate a formal parliamentary apology to the families of those affected by these practices.

In relation to the potential breaches of the law and questions of accountability, I have written to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Daryl Coates SC, and to the Commissioner of Police, Ms Donna Adams PSM, APM. In those letters, I've drawn the coronial findings to their attention. Any decisions about criminal investigation or prosecution are and must remain matters for those independent statutory authorities. It is not for the government to direct those outcomes, but it is our responsibility to see that the relevant bodies are formally aware of the findings. Additionally, as the Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing said, her department has been directed to review all available records to ascertain whether there are other individuals who can be identified as having engaged in these practices.

I've heard very clearly the concerns raised by the handling of individual cases associated with the Rodda Museum, acknowledging the distress caused by the late discovery of retained specimens and the processes which followed. These concerns are being taken seriously and I can confirm that work is underway to review the Coroners Act, including to identify any improvements relating to the provision of information and support for families, friends and others in difficult and sensitive circumstances. Throughout this engagement, I've remained mindful of the independence of the court and the coroner, while ensuring that legitimate questions concerning lawfulness of the retention of specimens, accountability and transparency are properly addressed.

I can inform the House that I've instructed the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute to review the Coroners Act 1995 and the Coroners Rules 2016; with a particular focus on:

Any desirable changes to jurisdiction, powers, practices and/or procedures of the coroner and the division that would better service the needs of people interacting with the Coronial Division and the needs of the community; and

any improvements to be made to the provision of information to and support for the families, friends and others associated with the deceased person who is the subject of a coronial inquiry, including, but not limited to issues regarding autopsies, cultural and spiritual beliefs and practices and counselling services.

The TLRI review provides an important opportunity to ensure that the lessons of the Rodda Museum matter are fully absorbed into the future coronial practice.

The Tasmanian Law Reform Institute (TLRI) process will also provide a pathway for affected families and indeed, the broader community, to share their experiences and insights. I'm acutely aware that for many, telling their story again can be retraumatising. For that reason, I've asked my department to liaise with the TLRI to offer assistance on how to best support those engagements.

The University of Tasmania has already issued a public apology, acknowledging the hurt experienced by families as a result of these historical practices. There is understandably an expectation that the state will also formally acknowledge this role. That's why the government will facilitate a formal statement and parliamentary apology for these historic practices, and I want to place on the record my deep regret for what families have endured. 

What happened was wrong - it should never have occurred. Families were entitled to trust that their loved ones would be treated with dignity, transparency and respect, and that trust was broken. For that, we are profoundly sorry. Thank you, Speaker.

[2.51 p.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I rise today to welcome the update provided to the House by the minister for Health. However, on behalf of the families who have contacted me, I must also offer some reflections in reply. While the government has acknowledged what has occurred and the hurt it has caused the families and friends involved, what is not yet fully understood or recognised is that many of the deceased passed away in deeply tragic and traumatic circumstances. While all deaths are unfortunate, coroners only become involved when the death is unexpected, unexplained, or where the state or an individual may have contributed to the circumstances of that death. 

I've been rendered speechless by the harrowing stories shared with me by affected families - stories of loss, trauma, and lifelong grief caused by those deaths. For many, the wounds left by those deaths have never fully healed, and for some, the state itself was responsible for the failings that contributed to their loved one's death. To be wronged by the state decades later is almost inconceivable. These revelations have retraumatised these families, bringing with it the sleepless nights, grief, anguish, and a sense of torment - as if they had not suffered enough already.

Adding to their pain, many families first learned of these revelations through a full-page newspaper advertisement. You have acknowledged that the display of the remains in the RA Rodda Museum disregarded the cultural beliefs of the individuals and communities, yet after these revelations came to light, the government ignored certain families' cultural beliefs when decisions were made on how to dispose of the remains. These families have every right to demand answers about this dreadful situation. How could it have happened? Who was responsible? Who knew? Why did it continue for so long? Why did the state take so long to act and even longer to tell the families? Why were requests from families for burial or return of the remains ignored?

I want to acknowledge the member for Nelson in the other place for early and tireless advocacy on behalf of many of these families, yet even her efforts were met with initial silence from the government. That silence forced families to go to other MPs, like me, to the media, to statutory bodies, even to federal representatives, simply to have someone listen; to have someone acknowledge their pain and try to obtain the answers they deserved. The coroner's findings in September provided some answers, but raised many more questions, questions families have put to the coroners office and the Attorney-General's office, questions for which they had received no response until today.

When you understand what these families have endured, the initial silence from the government was not merely frustrating, it was deeply hurtful. For some, it reinforced the belief that something was being covered up. Families have told me they felt disrespected, disregarded and ignored after everything they had already suffered, and this, understandably, made many of them angry. This is why I've continued to raise this matter in every parliamentary sitting since it was brought to my attention, why I've written to the Attorney-General and why I've pursued these issues during budget Estimates.

Here we are now, almost a year since families were notified via newspaper notice of this profound failure by the state, the minister is providing families with an update. It should not have taken this long. 

To the Minister for Health, I thank you for taking the time to provide this information today. Your indication that a formal apology is forthcoming is welcome. I hope the government will enable impacted family members to attend the apology at no expense to those families.

I urge the minister and the department when engaging with the families to take the time to understand the unique and deeply personal impact this has had on every family involved. Let them finally be heard, and give them answers to the questions they have. They deserve at least that. Otherwise, an apology without listening, without understanding and without answers will be seen as little more than an empty gesture. Thank you, Honourable Speaker. 


[2.55 p.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I rise in response to the Ministerial Statement today, and thank the minister for the statement and for acknowledging the gravity of the issue. It's been a deeply distressing matter for families and for the broader community, and it goes to the heart of trust, dignity and respect for those who have passed. 

The coroner's report revealed that 177 human specimens were retained by the Rodda Museum between 1966 and 1991 without the knowledge or consent of the families, and some were publicly displayed. These practices were described by the coroner as offensive to contemporary standards and values, and inconceivable that they continued for so long.

The impact on families has endured renewed grief decades after losing loved ones. Some have had to re-bury remains. Others discovered their loved ones' names in a public notice. The trauma has been compounded by the way the information was communicated - advertisements in newspapers, lists online - often without the adequate amount of support or sensitivity. For many, this has reopened wounds that had barely healed, and it's shaken confidence in our institutions.

Today, while we welcome the statement and the commitment to a formal parliamentary apology - that we've been confirmed will be in consultation with affected families - this is an important step towards healing. In the Ministerial Statement, it was important to note that there is the intention for a formal parliamentary apology, and that it will be done in a way to coordinate access for family members that are affected.

Literally, at this moment, I have had some correspondence come into the office asking about the way to facilitate that support and if it can be done without cost or impediment to families, some of which may have to travel distances, with support for accommodation and transport. It would be appreciated if that was looked into.

It's also, in the Ministerial Statement, important to note that it is clear, for the record, that the current forensic pathologists were not involved in those historic matters; and there continues to be investigations that are appropriate, the Attorney-General himself having referred the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions and Tasmania Police; and that there be a review that's happening around the Coroners Act.

The apology, when it happens, obviously needs to be meaningful and trauma-informed, and accompanied by action. This is not just about pathology, about law or about history, but it's really about humanity and dignity. We have to ensure, from now, that every Tasmanian can trust that their loved ones will always be treated with respect, both in life and in death. Each member of this place that has spoken today, let us all make sure that this is the turning point for how we handle sensitive matters, and that it is done always with compassion and accountability at the core, so that this never happens again.

[2.59 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I wasn't going to speak today, but I feel compelled to do so, and I feel compelled to do so on behalf of those Tasmanians who have reached out to me about their experience. I know many have to many members of this place and I, too, along with my fellow members of the Labor Party, want to put on the record my sincere condolences to those Tasmanians who were affected and let down by the system.

Those Tasmanians that I've met with, this has deeply impacted them, many of them for their entire life. As Mr Garland said, many of them, in fact, experienced terrible deaths of their loved ones that this has only compounded and made worse, and brought up many traumatic experiences and deeply impacted them years later. 

The way in which they found out, I believe, wasn't appropriate - for it just to be in a newspaper ad, in the daily circulating newspapers. My understanding of the communications that they've had through the coroners office and others, at times has been really difficult. I  would agree with Mr Garland when he said that the government's response has been tardy. I believe it has been as well, and not just this current government but previous governments when this issue first came to light. It is, as Ms Finlay says, an absolute injustice to these Tasmanians and their loved ones and they deserve the respect of this parliament and of the Tasmanian community. I know through those I've worked with, many of those remains went on to be cremated without their permission, which is absolutely abhorrent. I can't understand how this practice occurred in our state and I, like others, want to see no stone left unturned to ensure that we find out exactly why it happened and those who were responsible are held accountable. 

I hope this provides Tasmanians who have been affected and their families with some comfort today, but I think there's a long road to go and this is the first part of that process. An apology will be important, but there are other steps in that process that need to be undertaken by the government to continue to provide support to these Tasmanians. 

As others have said, I think it will be difficult, not only financially but geographically, for many of these families to be able to come to Hobart and hear that apology firsthand, so I want to put on the record today to the government to please consider televising that in other parts of the state or making forums available for people to come together in more rural and remote communities to hear that apology on that day. I think that would mean a great deal to those people. 

I want to conclude my contribution by saying how important it is that there is ongoing support for these families, because many of them have been let down before by the state through traumatic ordeals and circumstances around the deaths of their loved ones. They deserve that ongoing support from us and I believe that's the very least we can do.

DIVISIONS 1, 7, 10 and Schedule 1, Part 6 -
(Premier)

[3.06 p.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, Chair, and my apologies for being a touch late to the lectern. Thank you to all the people who provided scrutiny throughout the course of the week around budget Estimates. I very much appreciate all the work that goes into asking the questions and the research, and indeed the work of our departments as well. I also very much appreciate the ministers and committee members and chairs, so thank you.

I'm very proud of the fact that Tasmania continues to be a state that is strong, confident and full of opportunity. Our government has a clear vision for the state to make Tasmania the best place to live, to work, to raise a family and of course to invest as well. The ambition is not just an aspiration; it's a very real target for us. In this place I often reflect on the achievements of the last 10 years, not our achievements but every Tasmanian's achievements. I do this because Tasmanians ought to reflect on what they have achieved and be very proud of these achievements, because there's plenty Tasmanians have done to help grow, improve and develop our state and improve our services. It is important to reflect on those achievements we've delivered together and take notice of the positive contributions so many Tasmanians have made to our state.

It's through the collective efforts of many Tasmanians over the past 10 years that we've been able to deliver a $40 billion-plus economy, record low unemployment and over 51,000 new jobs created and a leader when it comes to business confidence in the nation. I often refer to these achievements in this House because they are a positive thing for Tasmanians. At a time when the Tasmanian community demands certainty, stability and responsibility, we're able to show that our economic plan for this state is working. There are more people working, more businesses thriving and more opportunities for more Tasmanians. This is what our plan has delivered over the past decade and will continue to do.

We need to be realistic, however, and there's many challenges that all Tasmanians have faced along the way. There will be other challenges that will come up as well and we have shown that despite these challenges, we've been able to deliver a better Tasmania. Under our plan, we will continue to invest in the areas that create even more opportunities for Tasmanians and I'm very proud to do so and continue to rise to the challenges as they present themselves.

We are here today on the back of an interim budget that followed an election that Tasmania didn't want or need. The usual six-month period we had to produce a budget was compressed into two, and we need to be realistic and acknowledge that the interim budget is a reflection of that. Still, the interim budget shows that we are continuing to invest in our communities, our industries, our businesses and growth in Tasmania and provide improved services. We are continuing our record investment in our education system, our healthcare system and infrastructure and investing in Tasmania's future. 

The interim Budget underpins our plan that is delivering a better, fairer and stronger economy, and I'm proud of Tasmanians for achieving that. I want to thank the Treasurer very much for the work and stewardship that Mr Abetz has done on the interim Budget. I know he will thank his Treasury team and staff as well, but I also want to pay tribute to their work in a short amount of time and the work on the next budget has started. They have been doing an outstanding job.

Chair, last week we released our latest update on our 100 days of delivery and it demonstrates our government's record against our first 100 days following the election. What this demonstrates, is our continued commitment to give Tasmanians that certainty and that stability and make delivery a key aspect of our agenda.

What it also is very good at doing, is ensuring that myself, our ministers and our departments are accountable for the delivery and the commitments that we have made and continue to make. In the 100 days since the recommissioning of our government, we have delivered on 465 initiatives to deliver action on the cost of living, health and housing. One example is the delivery of cost of living relief for families through our universal school breakfast program and our expanded healthy school lunch program, which I have often spoken about as helping our young people to engage in education by removing significant barriers, to ensure that they are in school and a learning environment where they feel safe and most comfortable to learn.

We're getting more Tasmanians in a home, the delivery of a more social and affordable housing and delivering initiatives including the increased first home owners grant and stamp duty concession. We're expanding the scope and quality of our healthcare system through service and scope of practice expansions and investing in breast screening and diagnostic services. When it comes to health service delivery, I'm very proud of the work that successive Health ministers have done in cutting red tape, improving access to primary healthcare services and, most notably, as we speak of the scope of practise when it comes to our pharmacies and allowing our pharmacists to do more. If my memory serves me correctly, there's been 10,000 treatments to the women of Tasmania through our pharmacies for their health concerns that would otherwise have been through the local GP. We know getting to see a GP is a challenge for all sorts of reasons, and alleviating that pressure allows people to be supported with their healthcare sooner.

In our next 100 days, we will add an additional 148 items to that list among the many others that will no doubt be delivered. Taking action on the cost of living and providing more housing options for Tasmanians; building a better healthcare system and delivering a stronger economy. We will build an even better health system by assessing expressions of interest for the new TassieDoc program to provide a further four 100 per cent bulk-billing clinics and access the grants program to extend pharmacy operating hours.

We will release the second draft of legislation to establish TasInsure, following public input into a discussion paper and the receipt of expert independent advice to enable Tasmanians to access cheaper, fairer insurance.

We will introduce legislation to freeze changes to the National Construction Code, cutting red tape and helping home builders avoid unnecessary costs and delays and we will establish a roundtable with councils to look at options for fast-tracking rezoning, specifically in nominated housing growth areas to reduce timeframes. And, because our strong economy underpins all that we do, we are continuing this focus with a position paper to be released on Tasmania's 2030 Economic Future Act, a landmark legislation to streamline approvals and unlock investment.

All of these are part of our 148 initiatives because we are keen to keep ourselves accountable, on track and continuing to deliver and getting on with the job.

Turning to some of the matters raised during Estimates, again I thank all those who engaged in scrutiny and relevant to the committees which I attended, the Macquarie Point Stadium, as it has often done, and in the last few years in the 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 scrutinies, establishing our very own AFL team. It will give our young people aspiration, transform Macquarie Point from an industrial wasteland, create thousands of jobs and give Tasmanians exactly what they've been fighting for decades. Put simply, we cannot afford to lose this opportunity. Again, I pay tribute to all the 15,000 people who attended the pro rally on the lawns of Parliament House on Sunday. It was uplifting, particularly on a rainy day, to have people attend from all across the state and speaking with one voice about this project.

I also pay tribute to those who have not supported the project and who have scrutinised, asked questions. Each question that was asked and information provided, has helped us to be in a position and we will be in a position, of course subject to the Legislative Council's support, to be the best project possible. No doubt at the next budget Estimates I'm sure we will be scrutinised as well with respect to the delivery of this project.

We also spoke about reinforcing public confidence in the salmon industry's long-term sustainability and our commitment to robust oversight and the government has announced a range of measures. 

Our support for TT-Line was also a matter of scrutiny as well and this is absolutely expected given the forum that we're in. Our commitment was to get the Spirits back on track. We have done so; that's what we're doing and we are ensuring that TT-Line has the resources it needs to get the job done as well. We have provided assurances around the company's solvency. We will always support our government businesses and, frankly, why wouldn't we?

Salmon, of course, again appeared throughout Estimates. As I say, we want robust oversight as well. I thank the members for their questions, most notably coming from the honourable member for Franklin, Mr George and the Greens members as well. What our commitment to the study will provide is to enable all stakeholders to focus on transparency, science and best practice for protecting our environment and the continuous improvement of an industry that we all value for the work that it does, the regional jobs and economic contribution it makes to rural and regional Tasmania. Our objective with the study moving forward is to ensure the continuity of a highly valuable, the largest primary industry in Tasmania and the ongoing contribution to our community. We believe, of course, it's important that we continually improve to strengthen public confidence and provide investment certainty for the future, and these actions reflect our commitment to the sustainable future for salmon farming in Tasmania.

Again, I would like to congratulate the Treasurer for his efforts with respect to the interim Budget, as well as Treasury officials and staff for developing the interim Budget in a compressed timeframe, as well as their efforts to commence the budget development process for 2026-27 state Budget to be handed down in May next year.

Thanks also to the Chairs of the Committees and all members and support staff for their work during Estimates. We will work through the rest of the week on this Budget and, as I said before, the work has already started on the May 2026-27 Budget, in which we will also deliver for Tasmania.

[3.20 p.m.]
Ms FINLAY - Chair, it is always interesting when the Premier presents himself at the lectern. He just apologised for being a little late and he looked a little flustered. Flustered is a high-energy presentation, but I remember the opening moment of Estimates just a short two weeks ago and he looked less than flustered and when asked the first question, there was this massive sigh, a rounding of the shoulders and it was like, 'I've got to get through this week'. It's a bit of an indication of the feeling of this government right now.

The intention and the purpose of Estimates scrutiny is for members of this place to be able to ask questions to seek clarification around the commitments they're making in the budget, to understand the shaping of the budget, what they're looking to deliver and what's in and what's out. Unfortunately, it has become the case, prior to a budget being prepared, when a budget is delivered and when you receive the papers, that this government has an art of not making things clear. This government has an art of trying to hide the full intentions of what they're doing, which doesn't always align with what they've told people they will do, so it often takes intense and repetitive questioning to seek answers and get honesty out of this government.

Some of my personal experiences through Estimates I want to share this afternoon in having to ask multiple questions over multiple rounds of questioning to actually get someone to tell the truth and answer a question. It shouldn't be that hard. It shouldn't be so hard for members of our community, when given commitments in writing, to trust that. It shouldn't be so hard that when members of our community hear our government make a commitment, they can believe it, but it is, and not only through the period of Estimates two weeks ago, through GBEs, through Question Time and through public presentation of this government's position, in everything this government does, they make it hard. 

The Premier just got to his feet and talked about this Budget and this current government creating certainty for the community. That's a laugh. He talked about responsibility. That's also a laugh. He talked about accountability and one of the things that was uncovered in this chapter of Estimates was the fact that there is almost zero accountability required by this Premier, the leader not only of Tasmania but the leader of the government, to seek and create accountability through his ministers. We have seen multiple examples. Perhaps it would be excusable if just once something didn't go quite right, but when there is a repetition of behaviour and it becomes a culture of this government to not feel like it is necessary to do the right thing, and for the Premier not to feel like it is his responsibility to hold his ministers to account, we know that there's a serious problem in this government. 

I want to reflect on two matters that became very evident throughout Estimates, one being something that we prosecuted for further clarification today in question time. It's the matter of the Premier holding his ministers to account through either the caretaker conventions when in an election, their ministerial codes of conduct or holding them to account for their responsibilities under acts and laws in Tasmania. 

In Estimates it was confirmed that Tasracing used taxpayer funds and resources to deliver messages from this government into the public realm to publicly promote positions of this government. We know that's not okay and we know that the Premier, who's not in the Chamber now, also knows it's not okay, because through that time in Estimates when his minister was being asked questions and through questions today, the Premier didn't have an answer. If the Premier actually believes what he said on his feet just a moment ago, that he believes in accountability, then he must immediately launch an investigation into what happened with the Tasracing and TasInsure communications through the election.

In my own electorate of Bass, a commitment was made by the Sports minister to the North Launceston Footy Club that they would have $100,000 to ensure their plans for the future if the Liberal government was re-elected, but now the government has decided that because the footy club spoke to somebody else, they're not going to give them that money anymore. The Budget should be delivered on the promises that were committed to. There should be funds. There should be $100,000 in the Budget for the North Launceston Footy Club to secure their future because they're being pushed away from the home they've had for over 100 years. But when you can't find things in the Budget because the Treasurer and his fellow ministers find ways to not make it easy to see and seek clarity within the Budget, then you have to ask questions. When the answers are, 'Actually, I wanted to give the North Launceston footy club $100,000 but when they stood with Labor I decided they didn't really want it anymore and we've withdrawn it from the Budget', that's not okay and the Premier must deal with that type of behaviour. Ministers are expected to deal fairly, without bias and without regard to irrelevant information, and that's not happening and that's on the Premier. 

In my own scrutiny at Estimates, there were multiple times in some of my shadow portfolio areas where it required diligent questioning to actually get someone to focus on what the ask was and then to give an honest response, none more important than Primary Industries. I think people would say the Primary Industries minister is doing a pretty good job. He's working hard and wants to deliver for farmers and fishers around our state, but the problem with nice people who try to do a good job is that when there are specifics and important information that needs to be truthful, that's when it really matters. That's actually what reveals the true core of a person. 

In our Primary Industries Estimates, there were lots of questions - not surprisingly, given the makeup of the minority parliament - around salmon, florfenicol and lots of different issues in the community, and these questions aren't always asked by everyone because of the particular subject matter, they're actually asked for integrity. I had to ask, through the minister, members of the department multiple times when they first knew that the industry intended to use florfenicol, and blunt faced to me, the person replying said, I' didn't find out till July'. We have correspondence between the government and industry in February indicating their intention to use florfenicol. 

This is not a salmon issue, not a recreational fishing issue, not a rock lobster issue, this is an honesty issue. If this government can't be honest about the fundamentals of the issues that are before them, how can the community trust anything? If this government knows there are things happening in our community that misrepresent critical information and they don't act, how can the community trust them? When members of this place ask questions through Estimates, it is the most fundamental expectation that they will act quickly, without too much fuss or bother, and give an honest answer. 

There were other questions in the primary industry space. NRE is a massive department. They have so many responsibilities and so many areas of work, but there are many people doing a lot of work with few resources. There are a number of teams in NRE right now that used to be resourced to eight or nine people that are working that workload with one or two people. When those questions were asked in Estimates in regard to looking to future budgets, yes, there was a recognition that many departments are under pressure, overwhelmed and there are challenges with the culture within that department because of the workload and the expectations, but they said, 'Oh no, that's okay, we're going to put more funding the budget in the future.'

Way to make your Budget look good, Treasurer, way to make the Tasmanian community feel like you know what you're doing as Treasurer when you say that there is a pathway to surplus when you actually withdraw funds in the future years to make it look good so you think you can get to a surplus. We know that when the real Budget comes out in May you will be required, and we will hold you to account, to make sure that you put credible figures in the Budget that show a true representation of the position right now and a true indication of how you intend to have money in the Budget. In May, you won't be able to say honestly that there is a pathway to surplus unless you do something drastic. The community are concerned that you will either do one of two things. You will either continue to misrepresent the position of the finances of Tasmania or you will take drastic action in an unexpected way that will harm individuals, harm workplaces and impact people's jobs.

The Premier thanked Treasury when he was on his feet before. We all acknowledge and thank Treasury, but if only the Premier and the ministers listened to Treasury because for years through the fiscal sustainability report there have been alarm bells ringing about the need for this government to take corrective action. The government continues to ignore the advice of Treasury, or, in fact, on some matters like TasInsure, don't even ask for the advice of Treasury, and we find ourselves in this situation right now.

We know there are organisations like the North Launceston Footy Club that have been written to by this government and have had things withdrawn, but it's not just sports clubs, it's not just organisations that dare to deal and talk to other people across the Chamber. There are really critical - in my Environment space, which crosses over with the Primary Industries in NRE Tasmania - critical organisations working on behalf of Tasmanians that have not had a fair representation or understanding of their commitments. This impacts employees, it impacts contract certainty for organisations - and that impacts their ability and their liveability in Tasmania, their commitments to mortgages, to families, to their kids. 

So when an organisation as neutral as NRMs in Tasmania are told a commitment that no funds to NRMs will be reduced, redirected, or impacted - in writing - before an election and before a budget is handed down, but then in Estimates scrutiny, when asked particular questions about the allocations to NRMs they were told there wouldn't be a reduction. Then I was told, 'Oh no, it's going back to a pre-bonus level of $250,000 a year.' The deeds for NRMs haven't been $250,000 a year since 2013. Since 2013, the base deeds for NRMs have gone from $250,000, $350,000, $467,000, $544,000. How can this government be honest about the commitments that they're making? What they're doing is seeking to misrepresent positions to organisations and then misrepresent the real financials in the Budget to make it look better than it actually is. 

For people like our three NRMs in Tasmania, it's not good enough that where their funding is coming to an end, they believe they've received commitments, but the government isn't clear in communicating with them about what they can do with their core funding. 

It's like in the area of Primary Industries, commitments that are made to great people in this place, where they make and prepare plans for future seasons around something that is core to increasing the farm gate value for farmers around irrigation. 

There are two matters that I prosecuted in Primary Industries scrutiny with the minister around two different, but equally important, matters with irrigation. One is the Tamar Scheme, where the minister, and the people accompanying him, tried to retell a story that is well understood. They weren't able to secure enough water allocation, water sales with farmers, so we needed to change an instrument in this place to get industrial water to be able to pull water through for farmers. We know that. What we know is, and what we need is, for the government to act, and act fast, to ensure that the farmers that are preparing can have access to that water. We want a commitment. 

The minister has said that he's going to take the lead between NRE and ReCFIT, and he is going to drive an outcome and deliver the water for Tamar farmers. They want to see that sooner rather than later, because otherwise they will start withdrawing the money that they have in that at the moment, with the allocations that they've indicated, and they will start making decisions to look after water on their own properties, which is good for some, but not for everybody. Minister, I know you've made a commitment to act, but you must. 

The other place with irrigation that you must act is in Winnaleah. Initially, early in Estimates, there was a suggestion that a meeting had been set up between yourself and the Winnaleah irrigators. I trust that that's going to happen. I trust that it's going to be a productive meeting and it will advance the needs of those farmers, because for two irrigating seasons now, they have been promised that they would have community management and that there would be a genuine desire by Tasmanian Irrigation to work with those farmers to find a solution for community management of their scheme. They've been waiting for two seasons. Before the next season comes in, by the end of this financial year, again, minister, I know that you have committed to bringing this in, and that you say that it is possible to have community management. It is viable for the Winnaleah farmers to have community management. That must happen as a matter of urgency, because they have been waiting for seasons.

Another area of my portfolio responsibility which is critical to the future of Tasmania - equal to fishers and farmers - is innovation and AI in our digital economy. This government talks a big game about innovation, about its commitment to the digital economy, but talking a big game isn't action on the ground.  One of the first sets of questions that I asked about in Estimates of this government was about the governance, about the support provided across departments and across the government for the use of AI. For people to use AI well supported, well understood, in an environment where there are clear guidelines and frameworks, it can be really useful for us in Tasmania. It can be something that - when people are at the centre of every idea and every thought - it can increase efficiency, it can increase productivity and it could, if done well, increase the experience of people living in Tasmania. If it's just used for quick, gimmick, get out of jail free cards - like we know that the Premier used to prepare his legislation for TasInsure - that undermines the credibility of what can be done for Tasmanians. 

I trust that this government is providing equal access, equal training and equal understanding of people in government on how they can use AI, how it can deliver for Tasmanians, and where it remains human-centred and it keeps the liveability, the lifestyles and the affordability of Tasmanians front and centre with the decisions they make about that.

The other thing that was important to prosecute in Estimates, and that is well on the record from TasICT, is around the digital roadmap for Tasmania. I want to put on record some comments from TasICT, because if the minister and the government are not aware of their concerns, I will now put it on the record so that they are. Our state - we have some incredible people. We have creative and innovative people who do things that matter in Tasmania, that make a difference in Tasmania. We have people here who are operating all around the world, who are leading the world in their innovation and doing amazing things. We need to make sure that there's a clear roadmap for investments and for opportunity in Tasmania. TasICT, and I'm quoting them now, says:

Tasmania's tech industry is calling for leadership from the Tasmanian government in AI adoption and tech innovation, because otherwise it risks a damaging decline in the state's workforce productivity.

In its annual survey, TasICT team members reported optimism about business conditions, but warned more needed to be done to encourage Tasmanians to be confident with technology and consider tech careers.

TasICT CEO, Russell Kelly, said that Tasmania's tech firms were more optimistic than similar surveys taken nationally - 34 per cent of respondents expect revenue growth to be above 10 per cent in 2025 and 45 per cent plan to hire staff steady with last year. 

However, consistent with similar national surveys, retraction in government spending on technology has a huge flow-on effect to tech firms. 

'Tech jobs are productive jobs - they can help businesses get a competitive edge and help government provide services more cheaply. 

'Our sector urges the state government to have a digital roadmap for improving digital services in Tasmania.'

Mr Kelly said that the survey of members taken in September 2025 showed support for the adoption of AI, cybersecurity and skills shortages in tech. They were the major issues facing the sector.

Tasmania's tech sector currently employs 11,200 people (3.2 per cent growth) and adds $1.1 billion to the state's economy, with Deloitte Access Economics predicting 21,000 additional jobs could be added by 2035 in its 'Digital Pulse' report prepared by the Australian Computer Society.

'Crucially, 81 per cent of the TasICT members (almost all of them) consider that the State Government is not doing enough to advance the digital economy - and it's not improving compared with previous years.'

Mr Kelly said that more than 86 per cent of TasICT members were using AI in some form in their businesses, with a further 7 per cent researching adoption.

Mr Kelly said the coming State Government Budget needs to supercharge spending on technology and provide a roadmap to make Tasmania a smart state. 

'Tasmania has great potential to pioneer science, creative industry and sustainable tech, but we are moving slowly at a time when the arrival of AI is changing the world at break-neck speed.' [tbc]

The risk for Tasmania is, if we wait too long, if we are too slow at creating these opportunities, we're going to miss the boat and we're going to be left behind. Tasmania could be, and should be, at the forefront of these areas, and more needs to be done by this government to deliver that.

In the area of energy renewables, it would be expected that we would prosecute issues around Marinus, around North West Transmission, around our renewable investments, around Robbins Island and Whaleback Ridge and others across Tasmania. One of the areas that I wanted to really focus on, though, was around energy poverty - because it's real for Tasmanians. Cost-of-living pressures are real for Tasmanians. Tasmanian families are choosing to turn their power off in winter, to sit under rugs or go to sleep before the sun goes down because they fear that they can't afford, or they can't afford, the power that's required to look after them through winter. Tasmanian families are hurting.

We prosecuted questions around the number of Tasmanians who were having their power disconnected because they couldn't keep up with the increases in their bills. Tasmanians are having their power disconnected and it's taking a long time and a lot of costs to have it reconnected when they're already under financial pressure. I acknowledge there are a lot of good programs out there being delivered by the government. They are being creative about how they can wrap their supports around Tasmanians, but more needs to be done. 

Off the back of the position of Hydro having the two toughest years in terms of dry conditions, there won't be a renewable energy dividend for Tasmanians this year and that was something that came in with great fanfare from this government. When asked to provide the modelling from Hydro about future years and the climatic conditions to see how that would impact profits and therefore impact renewal energy dividends for Tasmanians, there were no answers. Hydro is a modelling entity, it's a climate weather entity that relies on water. They must know, the government and the minister must know what the future years will look like and what the impact will continue to have on Tasmanians. We need to do more to support Tasmanians who are in real energy poverty. They are the families at the centre that need our full attention and need to understand that the government continues to care with greater regard.

We talk about budget mismanagement and areas where there needs to be savings, but so often with this government it's poor decision-making or pauses on decision-making or errors in decision-making, which is costing Tasmanians greatly. Off the back of the Marinus decision with full fanfare, you would expect that the works undertaken at Tarraleah and the projects being proposed at Cethana with pumped hydro would be full gas going forward, but there was a delay. I can understand that there would be a delay with regard to reconsidering a position, but lengthy delays happened in decision-making and the Tarraleah project was put on pause for a period of time, which cost millions of dollars in terms of the consideration and tens of millions of dollars for the outcomes of the capital costs for Tarraleah. They're the sorts of places where Tasmanians are feeling the pressure of additional costs in the Budget. 

The Energy minister was responsible for delivering a power deal for Bell Bay Aluminium, a 10-year power deal they need. They admitted on their own records that they had been working on this for six years, had been in deep negotiations with Bell Bay Aluminium and couldn't get it across the line. We know there will be work done in a committee with the feds around creating an outcome for Bell Bay Aluminium. They've given themselves a 12-month extension and there were questions asked in Estimates about their confidence to deliver an outcome in the next 12 months. When you reverse-engineer the needs for Bell Bay Aluminium and the workers on that site to have certainty for their future and the productions on that site, there needs to be well in advance of that 12 months a commitment for this government to be able to deliver the power deal and the future for Bell Bay Aluminium.

It's like the uncertainty at Liberty Bell Bay which requires a team effort. They are two completely different but critical issues in the electorate of Bass, critical issues for the workers in that local area and, most importantly, critical issues for many hundreds of small businesses across Tasmania that rely on both of those sites and many of our major industrials in Tasmania.

NRET for me covers Primary Industries and Water, Environment and Parks, and there are massive pressures in that department. I raised concerns but didn't get clear answers about the investment in supporting the people. There have been surveys, the outcomes of which have been tabled, of the culture of that department. I hear many times brought to me concerns from individuals who work in the area and from the unions that support the people who work in the area, and in my conversations with fishers and farmers I hear of the concerns of the pressure and the resourcing in NRET. If we want to look after our environment, the quality of our water, our fishers and farmers and our world-renowned parks, we've got to make sure that the people doing the work are looked after. 

One area of concern for me in Parks that was prosecuted in Estimates was the Pioneer Dam. There is a beautiful community of people who love to do the most classic of Tasmanian activities and camp in pretty fundamental capacity at Pioneer Dam. There was a concern with the dam wall and there is an outcome of some engineering reports. Minister Duigan, although not clear, did say he was looking to facilitate the return of those activities to Pioneer Dam. I trust that the minister will maintain his word and that, although complex, he will support the people who love camping at Pioneer Dam, and after the wall is removed and the waters are released above the wall, there is a return to that activity at Pioneer Dam.

Similarly, another great activity that all Tasmanians love is mountain biking. At Kate Reed Reserve, close to Launceston, there is an opportunity to increase infrastructure to provide a trailhead for the mountain bike trails in that area and in doing so, provide roads and open up thousands of housing opportunities across the South Prospect proposal. We asked questions in Estimates of the department on how advanced the RAA was for Kate Reed Reserve and what impediments there were, or what needs to be managed in order to be able to deliver on that. This is a critical piece of infrastructure that is at the centre of lots of challenges and this is a bit of an illustration of the challenges for this government.

In one small area there is a major highway that bottlenecks at the Bunnings turnoff and is completely unsafe in terms of how people exit off the highway into the Bunnings area. Then you've got families under that roundabout that are trying to get their kids out and be healthy and get them into the Kate Reed Reserve and they have to park on the side of the highway on an underpass and get their kids up and over a fence into the reserve. It's extraordinary what is required for families to recreate in that area.

There is a proposal here that can open up solutions for safe access to the mountain bike trails, and with some lateral thinking this government could look to do more work to improve the safety of that highway coming out of Launceston going south, when it turns off to Bunnings in the Youngtown area. It could also unlock thousands of homes for the South Prospect project and lots of community facilities and activities. In the Parks portfolio, a priority of focus has been on the proposal at Kate Reed Reserve. There have been commitments of consideration and a commitment to deliver on those outcomes would be welcomed by the community.

This Budget, again like what's happened in previous years, is an attempt by this government to run a smoke and mirrors campaign, an attempt by this government to say there's a pathway to surplus when we know there's not, an attempt by this government to hide things where they'd made commitments and then don't deliver on them. For something as simple as Flinders Island and the $320,000 that was promised to support them for the lights for their runway, they have correspondence, they were told they were going to get it, in the election it was announced and then it's not in the Budget.

I love the language in the letters this government use when they write to people they've made commitments to. They say, 'Sorry, it's an interim budget', although that's an excuse, 'but we may be able to find savings, or we may be able to find allocations in the next budget'. Who's going to believe that? Who's going to believe what the government says anymore, when you write to correspondents like that? 

Tasmanians deserve better. Tasmanians deserve to be able to trust their government. They expect a government that has integrity. They expect a government that is honest. They expect a government that actually stands up and delivers and takes action on the things that they say are important, not a government that just talks, puts things in writing and then says, 'I didn't really mean it, it doesn't really matter', and has a premier who, when his ministers do things that are abhorrently disrespectful and against their own codes of conduct and caretaker convention, doesn't stand up and do anything about it.

Between this interim Budget and the budget next year, this government and the Premier are on notice. Maintain the standards of your ministers. Don't raise expectations in the community in a way that you know that you never intend to deliver. Premier, when your ministers are doing things that are not okay, you need to take action.

Dr WOODRUFF - Deputy Chair, I'm very pleased to provide our thoughts on the government Estimates committee process that happened. I will speak as the leader in my portfolios and make some general comments and all the Greens members are going to talk about the portfolio responsibilities they had and the conversations they had with ministers.

The Greens are incredibly concerned about the state of the budget. We're on record for being concerned about the state of the budget, and we can see the path that the Treasurer is walking us down. In fact, he's been very open about that. He's walking us down 2800 public service job cuts as of today. We wait to hear what the next budget will bring, but he has foreshadowed that cuts are going to be deeper. He's been quite clear about that and we know that the debt that this state is labouring under is like nothing we've ever seen before in Tasmania. It is a matter of mainland conversation, the basket case of Tasmania's finances. If other members don't speak to relatives or hear from people on the mainland, you should ask them what the current conversation about Tasmania is. Everyone is aware that we've had multiple credit downgrades now - two, just in the last week - and that is going to have a devastating effect on the amount of money that we have to spend every single year, every annual budget to servicing the debts that we will take out on any further infrastructure, including the stadium.

Obviously, the Greens oppose the stadium because it is a financial disaster for the state; because we desperately need services, and the funding for them, for people who don't have service provision today; and because of what it would do to the centre of Hobart and the damage it would bring to the sacred side of the Cenotaph, to our heritage values, - The prime reason people come to Hobart is to look at our heritage, which is not some ticky-tacky show heritage, but a living heritage. We live our heritage in Tasmania - the Constitution Dock, all the buildings around the waterfront, they've been used in recent living memory as active places of industry and manufacture and they exist today representing a lived experience of colonial heritage.

The stadium is proposed to be on a site far more significant than colonial heritage and that is the place where Muwinina people lived on the banks of Timtumili Minanya and they lived for countless generations in that space. It's a very important spot that, as has been discussed and proposed, should be a site of remembrance, reflection and truth-telling. It should be a place where Aboriginal people craft and design as a reconciliation, remembrance and truth-telling site, not a stadium.

The point is, when we went into the Estimates process we were concerned to get information from ministers about what the real costs of the stadium will be to Tasmanians in cuts to services over the long term, and what the current - regardless of whether a stadium is built or not, what the cost will be under this Liberal government with the harsh austerity approach from the current Treasurer in deciding on the priorities of spending in the budget. The real cost to people who don't already have access to healthcare treatment when they need it and to community services that are already being pinched and are not functioning at the need that people who are offering the services. I'm talking about people like Neighbourhood Houses, food distribution programs, homeless shelters, family violence shelters - all of these places, we know, it's a matter of record, are struggling today already and the need, we understand, is growing. Into this space we asked the questions, what are the real costs going to be in each area of the Budget, in each portfolio area? What are the decisions that the government are making about spending? What will those decisions mean? What are they cutting ou [Bookmark: Phr2_O=28.6_D=2.0_C=0.59] t, what are they not prioritising?

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.3_D=14.4_C=0.90] Obvious to us as the Greens is that the government does not prioritise - and indeed we found out, will not prioritise - any money to protect the environment, even though we've had a State of the Environment Report an [Bookmark: Phr4_O=45.9_D=29.9_C=0.84] d member for Clark, Mr Bayley, will go into this in more detail. Even though we've had a State of the Environment Report, which has a devastating record for Tasmania and a series of recommendations that the government needs to take up in order to shift us from our continuing state of decline across ecosystems that are the bedrock of survival and flourishing in this state [Bookmark: Phr5_O=76.0_D=24.6_C=0.86] , the government hasn't agreed to adopt any of them and the government hasn't put any money into responding to any of them.

Anybody who has responsibility for a Primary Industry portfolio, anyone who's concerned about rivers and water catchment and Tasmania irrigation, anyone who's concerned about the impacts on [Bookmark: Phr6_O=101.4_D=4.2_C=0.91]  animals and insects that we need to  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=106.8_D=26.4_C=0.88] pollinate crops and to support functioning, healthy ecosystem, should be concerned about that. It's not just the Greens who are concerned about that. It is farmers, it is conservationists, it is people who are living on the land and who understand that this beautiful island that we live on is unique and special [Bookmark: Phr8_O=134.0_D=2.2_C=0.88]  and we not only have a responsibility [Bookmark: Phr9_O=136.9_D=18.5_C=0.86]  to look after it for the people we represent who live in Tasmania today for their health, wellbeing and prosperity, we also have a responsibility for our future generations because things are going in the wrong direction fast.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=156.4_D=2.4_C=0.92] I asked the Premie [Bookmark: Phr11_O=159.7_D=14.6_C=0.84] r about one of the costs to the budget. One of the worst examples of the bad priorities that the government is choosing [Bookmark: Phr12_O=176.2_D=13.0_C=0.76]  to make and it was in relation to the commission of inquiry. A key recommendation from the commission of inquiry is making sure that all children in care have [Bookmark: Phr13_O=189.6_D=4.9_C=0.80]  a case manager, setting a maximum caseload for child safety officers [Bookmark: Phr14_O=194.6_D=30.0_C=0.87] , and regularly publishing relevant data. That is a basic requirement to keep children in care safe and protected from potential child sexual abuse in an institution the state government is responsible for. You would think that that would be a funding priority, but we found that this government has pushed back the date for implementing that recommendation [Bookmark: Phr15_O=225.3_D=24.0_C=0.85]  by at least a year and likely up to 18 months. That means an extra year and a half on top of the year ahead of us. We are two and a half years away, by the government's current projection, from ensuring that every child in child safety services has a case manager [Bookmark: Phr16_O=250.6_D=5.1_C=0.80]  and that there is a maximum caseload for those case managers so that [Bookmark: Phr17_O=255.8_D=15.0_C=0.81]  they can do an effective job, let alone not be burnt out. This basic information, this basic service is not being prioritised and will not be funded and this is clearly a funding decision.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=271.3_D=27.8_C=0.89] What this demonstrates is the penny pinching that that the Treasurer is doing, scraping bits of money out of every pocket of every government service to make sure that the money that can be there to pay for the stadium, to pay for the interest that we're already paying on the interest and that we understand will be a compound interest rate. We've been warned [Bookmark: Phr19_O=300.1_D=4.9_C=0.64]  by Martin Wallace to the Legislative Council, a compound interest rate we will see from the cost of the stadium.

As if things aren't already bad enough, this government, this Treasurer, wants to ladle on the pain for people who are vulnerable, for people who are at risk, and take away the support and the checks and balances they desperately need. I thought it was shameful when I pointed these things out to the Premier, and he couldn't actually accept that the prioritising was occurring in that way. He couldn't accept that there are cuts.

There is no excusable reason to put off for another 18 months, on top of the extra year that it will already take them, the assurance that children who are in care have a case manager. Shame on the Premier for that approach.

The Premier said:

We need to acknowledge the enormous amount of work that has been done: the 57 recommendations and the enormity of the work and the complexity that's associated with such a large body of work with the Commission of Inquiry.

Yes, sure, it is a big job of work, but that's not the reason that this particular recommendation is not progressing in time. It is because it will cost money. That is something that the government is doing - they're pushing all those things as far as possible down the line as they can.

A second thing that I raised with the Premier was our concern about the firearm safety laws in Tasmania and the risk of them being weakened with pressure from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers member, to try and open Tasmania up to unsafe firearms laws by allowing the use of silencers and other sound suppressors, and shooting on public land. We have always stood for strong firearm laws in this state. Christine Milne led the charge and made sure that we had strong firearm laws. We will continue to stand with Tasmania Police, who are also concerned about the changing security environment, to make sure there is no weakening of our laws. It is very clear from recent incidents that have happened, where police were shot at. Only three or four weeks ago police had their car shot at, shot into, bullet holes in the car, and silencers were found on that property. It is a real and current risk. 

I was hopeful from the Premier's response where he said that the only exemptions that can be granted to use sound suppressors must be granted by the Commissioner of Police; currently there are 11 designated NRE employees who possess one of four permitted sound suppressors; and that the use of sound suppressors is subject to very strict conditions and limits their use in certain purposes. He also said, 'The risks presented by sound suppressors include public safety, misuse by shooters and criminal activity.' Community safety, he said, will always be the highest priority. Well, Premier, we will continue to hold you to that, because the firearms inquiry that was conducted after the Liberals attempted to weaken the laws following the 2018 election comprehensively recommended that we uphold our national firearms agreement, and that there be no change at all to that agreement or to Tasmania's position. And if there are to be any changes, they should go to the national level for discussion, Australia-wide, and not be made at the state level. We back our Tasmanian police and we will stand with people who want to be safe from gun violence.

I also spent a lot of time in Estimates talking about the government's failure to respond to the growth of the salmon industry and the incapacity of the regulations in Tasmania to protect the marine environment, and the interests of people in local communities, from the harms that are occurring from salmon industry operations in Tasmania. What we've seen with the dumping of a new antibiotic never before used in Tasmania, florfenicol, in southern waterways has been deeply, deeply concerning to people who live in the south. What we did was uncover the impacts and the staggering volume of antibiotics that have been used.

I asked the Premier about the rock lobster industry and the fact that, just recently, the rock lobster industry had been closed, but there wasn't any information given about why the industry - in the south, the D'Entrecasteaux Channel area - had been closed. I asked him why the notice didn't mention florfenicol, can he confirm that the reason the notice was provided was because of the florfenicol that's being used by salmon companies? And the Premier said, 'To the best of my knowledge, yes.'

It is a fact that this government is picking and choosing who it prioritises when it comes to the marine environment and the use of law, the rules and regulations about working in the marine environment. It is clearly choosing the biggest multinational corporations over smaller industries and over the marine environment and over local communities. Every single time, when salmon companies want to continue with growing fish to a certain size and to expand the scale and the intensity of production, they get to go ahead. What suffers is the marine environment.

What we're seeing - and we saw this from the conversations I had with the Premier, the Minister for Environment and the director of the EPA, and also with the Ministers for Primary Industries and Environment - is that the industry knows that there is Piscirickettsia salmonis. Obviously, disease is occurring, and instead of doing what global best practice and the research shows should happen - which is destocking pens that are diseased, fallowing them or moving the pens - it's continuing to stay where it is. It has now been able to access an emergency application for an untested antibiotic in Tasmania, florfenicol, and it has been dumping it in large quantities.

I thank the member for Bass, Ms Finlay, for her very detailed questions about antibiotic use, because we were a bit of a tag team in the Environment section, finding out how the salmon industry is working. It was very useful and gobsmacking to actually get the numbers. Mr Cook from the EPA did give us the numbers, and he told us the quantity of antibiotics used by the salmon industry in the last six years. In the last six years, the Tasmanian salmon industry has dumped 5946 kilograms of antibiotics into public waterways. That is basically 6 tonnes of antibiotics. We also found out, through the questions that I asked, that in the last 13 days there had been, at that time, 700 kilograms of florfenicol used in just three sites in the Huon and lower D'Entrecasteaux Channel. When I asked why it is that salmon companies are dumping florfenicol instead of destocking their diseased fish and fallowing their pens - which is the way farmers deal with disease - I had no answer to that. The answer is that this government will never apply the regulations to prevent the salmon industry from doing whatever it wants. We saw this time and again. There is the possibility to strengthen regulations, but there is no will to do it. The Premier made that clear in questions I asked him about his statements about putting the industry on notice. He said he will put the industry on notice. He's talked about putting the salmon industry on notice. But what he's doing is relying on an independent review which will take 18 months or so, which hasn't even started. It will take 18 months to get out of the blocks, and in that time, look at the harm that's occurring, when we've already got, today, since the Estimates two weeks ago, there's another 115 kilograms of florfenicol that has been dumped into the lower Huon and Channel areas. 

We understand that the industry is trying to get a permit to dump florfenicol on the east-coast. They won't stop. They will continue to do whatever they want in our public waterways. I cannot tell you how outraged east-coast shack owners will be if they spend Christmas there and florfenicol is being dumped in Okehampton Bay. It will raise the question about what are the harms that are happening to their beautiful waters over there? What are the impacts on the wild fish right near our Mercury Passage and Maria Island Marine Reserve? This is the impact that we have no information about. The research hasn't been done, but it's pretty clear from what's happened in Chile where there are barrens underneath areas where the Chilean salmon industry has been dumping florfenicol for years, it's obviously having a massive impact.

The Premier talked about regulations that have been put in place since 2014 to protect the marine environment and legislate the salmon industry, but they're old and they haven't been kept up to date. As I made the point, they're no longer proportionate to the scale and the density of production that's occurring and the expansion that's happened in the last 10 years in Tasmania. Which is why the government needs to step in and do something now, to prevent something happening of the order of catastrophe that occurred in South Australia in their marine environment.

That is a risk, and we are concerned about it, and so are communities who don't feel like they want to go swimming in the waters where there's been nearly a tonne of florfenicol dumped in the last couple of weeks and are not comfortable throwing a line into areas near the treatment sites. They're angry, and it seems as though the Premier and this government are much more interested in looking after the profits of big salmon corporations than it is in even slightly restraining their actions - even keeping all the other pens going; but even slightly restraining the actions is too much for this government to bear.

It says everything about an industry: Tassal, Huon, Petuna that have been funnelling money into the Liberal Party - donations that have been happening, just at a steady stream, doesn't even need the money; it's not about the money. It's about this government who is not prepared to stand up to the biggest salmon multinationals on the planet. They're not prepared to do it. They would rather sell out their voters, sell out the everyday Tasmanian who goes fishing, who lives on the water or who loves a healthy marine environment. They're the people who are getting sold out every day. It's pretty clear where their priorities are. This government would rather fund a stadium with Labor's help and push a stadium through that we know is going to add billions of dollars in debt over a decade and will cost - thanks to the Treasurer confirming it in Estimates - it will be costing us money in the budget year-on-year, to pay for the interest [Bookmark: Phr2_O=7.0_D=20.1_C=0.84]  and to pay, according to Martin Wallace's comments, compounding interest, $70 million, $75 million, $80 million, $90 million. They're the sorts of amounts he's talking about that it would cost over the next short period of time.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=28.4_D=6.6_C=0.79] In the time I have left, I want to talk about my conversations with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs [Bookmark: Phr4_O=37.0_D=1.0_C=0.51] , Mrs Archer [Bookmark: Phr5_O=40.0_D=18.0_C=0.86] . I was heartened to hear when I asked her questions about when the Aboriginal Heritage Act would be in parliament. She's laid out a timeframe for that coming to parliament by, I think she said, the middle of next year. I asked her whether [Bookmark: Phr6_O=58.2_D=1.1_C=0.82]  she had [Bookmark: Phr7_O=66.3_D=8.5_C=0.78]  an understanding and [Bookmark: Phr8_O=77.5_D=17.8_C=0.84]  whether she believed, recognised, and acknowledged cultural landscapes and the value that they hold for Aboriginal people. She said she did, which is great to hear because it's an incredibly [Bookmark: Phr9_O=95.6_D=1.1_C=0.76]  important [Bookmark: Phr10_O=98.1_D=23.9_C=0.82]  value that has to be enshrined in law. If there are no protections for cultural landscapes, it will not be possible to have proper protection for Aboriginal heritage.

The example of that writ large, is what's occurring at the moment on the west coast of Tasmania where this government, Mr Duigan, the Minister for Parks [Bookmark: Phr11_O=122.8_D=5.4_C=0.83]  and the Premier, has allocated $10 million to a four-wheel drive track [Bookmark: Phr12_O=128.7_D=26.0_C=0.84]  through the Arthur-Pieman Conservation Reserve. In itself, $10 million is bad enough when we don't get the money we need for Neighbourhood Houses, but what is truly appalling is it would be going through ancient Aboriginal heritage and we have an Aboriginal Heritage Act which is woefully ineffective, and worse, the Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area itself [Bookmark: Phr13_O=155.4_D=3.4_C=0.83]  is desperately out of date and needs to be updated. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=159.3_D=6.9_C=0.80]  Two things are happening that put some of the most significant [Bookmark: Phr15_O=167.8_D=20.4_C=0.83]  indigenous heritage on the planet at risk at the moment is this government's policy position to open up that heritage to being trashed by four-wheel driving. The Greens will continue to stand with Aboriginal people and do everything we can [Bookmark: Phr16_O=188.5_D=25.4_C=0.88]  to support them in opposing those tracks and to ushering in legislation, which is fit for purpose, and we would expect, and I'm glad to hear the minister say, 'It's certainly my wish and hope' that the Aboriginal Heritage Act 'will incorporate cultural landscapes.'

I also hope that the minister will be [Bookmark: Phr17_O=214.8_D=3.8_C=0.89]  true to her word about the Tasmanian Aboriginal Heritage Council [Bookmark: Phr18_O=219.1_D=24.5_C=0.77]  and its role. The difficulty for the Aboriginal Heritage Council is they've been doing their job; they've been making very strong statements opposing particular developments going ahead. They opposed the Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area being opened up for four-wheel drives, the Pilitika/Robbins Island wind farm development [Bookmark: Phr19_O=244.2_D=4.0_C=0.64]  and also the golf course on Mary Ann's [Bookmark: Phr20_O=248.9_D=25.5_C=0.81]  Island because of the impacts on Aboriginal heritage and their views were completely ignored. What is the role of the minister's own Aboriginal Heritage Advisory Council if time and time again they make assessments and time and time again they are ignored? Mrs Archer said she will be strengthening the role of the  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=275.2_D=4.1_C=0.77] council, and we look forward to that, and we expect it to be strengthened [Bookmark: Phr22_O=279.8_D=2.0_C=0.79]  so that it can do its job properly.

 [Bookmark: Phr23_O=283.0_D=8.9_C=0.70] Finally, I want to say that there was a commitment to progressing the work of treaty and I expect her to be holding her word, truth-telling first, she said, before treaty, we expect that pathway to occur swiftly.

[4.20 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT - Chair, I'm very pleased to stand speak to the budget Estimates committee hearings. I thank the Chairs and all those who participated in budget Estimates committee hearings. Certainly, what has been confirmed is that Tasmania has come a long way since 2014. Tasmanians are now backing themselves. What we do know that's come out of budget Estimates is that we have a strong economy and that continues to grow and, in fact, last month the latest information showed that Tasmania's economy recorded the highest per capita growth of any state in November 2025 and our economy is now worth $42.8 billion.

That is so important because you cannot reinvest in health, education, police, public safety without a growing and strong economy, and that's something I've certainly learned over the decades, including under the John Howard coalition government at the federal level, but it's a principle that I know is true and what we also know is that business confidence is up with the NAB survey again last month, being the top of the tree in Australia for Tasmania and we also know that business conditions, come in at second across all Australia in terms of the regulation rumble from the Business Council of Australia - coming second in Australia. That's a good sign for business. It shows there's confidence and the conditions are good, but we can always do more. 

What we've seen is the 51,000 extra jobs, the lowest or amongst the lowest unemployment rates in our history in Tasmania and what we saw in terms of confidence on the weekend were the 15,000 reasons why we're confident in Tasmania and they have expressed that confidence in the progress to seek support for the Macquarie Point multipurpose stadium as an intergenerational asset. See, this is an investment not just for the now, but for tomorrow and for the generations to come. Tasmania is not shying away from the big ideas and this government is not. What it's about, I believe, it will be a catalyst for renewal. It will be a catalyst for major events, for jobs, development, growth and opportunity, for aspiration, for our young kids and their future and, as the Premier has said, I've said many times, we want Tasmania to be the best place in the world to work, to live, to raise a family, to invest and to do business. That's part of our plan and we want to do that in Tasmania.

I was very pleased to be able to back in our small businesses as the Minister for Small Business. It is very encouraging, with 42,000 small businesses now, employing more than 100,000 Tasmanians, the backbone of our economy, particularly in those rural and regional communities, all across Tasmania. We're pleased and proud of them and, as a government, we're getting behind them with the 24/7 online business continuity planning tool and through the Business Tasmania website and the online service that's made available. Very pleased and proud of those contributions of our wonderful public servants in that space.

In terms of export success and global reputation, we certainly have what the rest of the world wants and in terms of our exports, it was made very clear that they are now record levels or near record levels of $6.16 billion in the last financial year 2023-24 and that's the second highest result ever recorded in our state and, in fact, it was a 5.2 per cent increase, which is a significant increase bearing in mind across the nation there was a slight decrease.

I want to pay a tribute to two national champions and that's the International Health Exporter of the Year, to Marinova, and they're based out of Cambridge, I have been there some time ago. Excellent organisation and I can see some nodding around the chamber. It's certainly a world leader in high purity fucoidan, which is a naturally occurring compound derived from seaweed and its products are used globally in pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals and advanced health technologies, and the award recognises not only commercial success but scientific excellence, innovation and a commitment to sustainable marine biotechnology. Marinova's growth shows that Tasmania can lead the world in specialist high-value industries. Congratulations. Well done at the national awards just last week in Canberra. That's a great credit to you.

Likewise, Small Business, that's such a joy to be Minister for Small Business and Trade and to know that the Small Business Exporter of the Year was Three Warriors. This again was a great credit to Three Warriors. It's been founded in Hobart. Three Warriors produces certified organic skin care and tanning products using Tasmanian ingredients. The company is expanding rapidly into international markets and changing perceptions about what Tasmanian businesses can achieve.

Their wins send a powerful message. Small business in Tasmania can scale globally and win. Yes, they've won in Tasmania, they've won nationally. It is a story of success of that small business; likewise, being the Small Business Exporter of the Year, it's a great credit to them.

In terms of our justice system, again, as an Attorney-General; Minister for Justice, Corrections and Rehabilitation; Tasmanians absolutely deserve a system that's fair, that's modern, that's responsive and accessible. There've been significant improvements that have been delivered under our government and I've often said and will say again right here and now that the TASCAT establishment, the Tasmanian Administrative Appeals Tribunal, has delivered one of the best justice reforms in the last decade or more. It gives you easier, faster and cheaper access to justice. The new Launceston TASCAT registry has opened. I was there just a few months ago with the relevant legal and justice stakeholders in Launceston. It was great to be with them and they're all delighted with the new registry in Launceston - multimillion dollar commitment and we're very pleased to allow access to TASCAT in northern Tasmania in that regard.

Talking about regional areas, the north-west coast has been the beneficiary of the new Burnie Courts redevelopment progress and that's very encouraging. You can see that the complex is going replace outdated facilities, it's going to improve service delivery in the north-west coast and for north-west coasters, this is delivering better access to justice. Both the Supreme Court and Magistrates Court will be there. There will be a justice precinct, so we're getting on with the job.

The legislative reform agenda has been very expansive and extensive, purposeful, with more than 22 major bills progressing in just one year alone and it's reflecting on the agenda of our justice team in our government. We're strengthening accountability, improving protections for victims, supporting vulnerable Tasmanians and certainly modernising a whole range of contemporary expectations. Family and sexual violence reforms, for example, released the discussion paper just recently. Very comprehensive, and we're inviting public feedback on that and it certainly complements the $100 million Family and Sexual Violence Action Plan and the targeted actions under that. I credit Will Hodgman, the former premier, for his leadership in 2015 for leading the nation in terms of some of those reforms.

In terms of legal aid, I am pleased and proud that this interim Budget has delivered an additional $4 million to meet rising demand and to reduce backlogs so the advocacy continues to secure appropriate Commonwealth funding for family law matters, which is absolutely a matter for the Commonwealth government.

In terms of rehabilitation and community safety, these are top priorities for our government, so our efforts continue in terms of expanding plans for electronic monitoring, home detention options and to increase community safety and provide smart sentencing pathways. Alcohol treatment orders through the court-mandated diversion programs are also very important and making a difference. We have the reforms from the commission of inquiry. They are being delivered. We've now got 54 recommendations that require legislative action and significant drafting and policy work is well under way. I thank my department and those across the government for that support. 

The new Commission for Children and Young People bill has been tabled here and it's currently upstairs. Delivering on that commission of inquiry report and recommendation is a key structural reform, and that's being delivered under our government. We are strengthening our victim-survivor rights and supports and will continue to do so. 

In the short moments I've got to conclude, I want to say we're continuing our efforts to cut the red tape, streamlining the processes to allow business to get on with doing what they do best, and that's with the national construction code freeze. We've made that decision, we've put a freeze on that, we've led the nation. The implementation of the National Construction Code 2025 changes will provide certainty for builders, certainty for tradies, certainty for small businesses, and make it easier and more streamlined. 

I say thank you to the Housing Industry Association, Ben Price; to the Master Builders Tasmania, Jenna Carney; and the Property Council of Tasmania for his strong support for this government initiative and support of these initiatives more generally.

I am aware of the Victorian Labor government's ban on Type 2 fireworks and the impact of the importation of fireworks into Tasmania and that particular ban through the Port of Melbourne. I want to make it clear that it is a great shame. We're standing up for Tasmania and the Tasmanian way of life to be able to enjoy cracker night, and it is part of the Tasmanian way of life. This blockage through the Port of Melbourne as a result of the Victorian Labor government is very disappointing. Both the former minister, Felix Ellis, and I have written to the relevant minister in Victoria. I'm asking the Victorian government to reconsider. We will continue to stand up for the Tasmanian way of life under our government and we will do everything we can to save cracker night in Tasmania. 

In conclusion, this is a good budget. It delivers for Tasmania and we are backing it in. I thank the House.

[4.33 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin) - Deputy Chair, I'd be worried if you were the firecracker industry because the last time I heard a Liberal minister say something was the Tasmanian way of life, it was the racing industry. It was the former minister for racing, minister Ellis, who said that racing was part of Tasmania's way of life. He didn't only say it once, he said it dozens of times, I'd say, before he and the Premier and minister Howlett decided to shut the industry down after having written to them to tell them that they had their full support. So best of luck to them. 

Obviously we'll be consistent with our views on these things, but we really can't trust a single word that anyone on that side says, whether it's in writing, whether it's signed, whether it's not signed, whether it's said in this place - nothing they say seems to last very long. 

This budget is quite extraordinary really - the context in which it's put. We have the former treasurer who has just  made his contribution - the first treasurer of Tasmania to not be able to deliver a budget since Harry Holgate in 1982 - who has said this is a good budget. 

This is a budget that doubles Tasmania's debt over the course of the next four years. It's a budget that has just delivered two credit downgrades by two of the largest credit ratings agencies in the world.

It was described by the former treasurer then, as a good budget. I'm not sure what metric you describe this budget as a good budget. This is a deeply concerning and worrying budget for Tasmania for very good reason. Tasmanians have seen, and are concerned about, the approach to budgeting that we've seen over the course of multiple treasurers and a single Premier who has overseen an incredible downturn in Tasmania's fiscal position. From having no net debt in 2014 when they came into office, that's in the general government sector, more than $200 million-worth of net cash and investments in the bank to now heading towards more than $10 billion worth of net debt if you take this Budget at face value, or $13 billion if you take the PEFO report that came out from Treasury earlier this year. 

The Budget is unsustainable. The very definition is it is unsustainable because we are spending far more than what we are bringing in in revenue. The sort of rhetoric that we hear from over on the other side is simply not going to cut it. Simply talking about growing our economy and that's how we will fix it is wrong. We've heard from Treasury that that can't happen. It's also wrong because we know that the vast majority of revenue in this Budget is coming from GST and other federal government transfers into the Budget. We actually have a very high reliance on the Australian Government on a GST deal which was signed off by this Tasmanian Liberal government to do Tasmania over in a very crass way - that's what happened. The premier of Western Australia and Malcolm Turnbull, Scott Morrison, Will Hodgman and Peter Gutwein, aided and abetted by their Cabinet and the Liberals over there, decided to do Tasmania over. Now we're in a situation where Tasmania's GST revenue is always on constant watch because we've got this GST deal that Tasmanians definitely didn't want and didn't need. We have the risk of that, plus we have just the continuing deterioration. 

The number I really want to focus on today is on page 103 of the budget forward Estimates as discussed during the week regarding the cash deficit position. There's an operating surplus - that's the headline figure the government will use and talk about getting to in the 2029 financial year. The issue is that, even once they get to an operating surplus - if they can actually achieve that and I have very serious doubts that they will - the cash deficit position in that year is still $423.6 million in cash deficit, which means that the debt keeps rising. For the 2024-25 budget, the figure was $1.5 billion in cash deficit. For this financial year that we are talking about, it's $1.3 billion. The following year will be $1.3 billion before it falls to a little over $600 million in 2027-28 and then 2028-29. The reason that the debt is growing, the reason that credit ratings agencies like S&P and Moody's are making the predictions they're making and downgrading our credit position is that the debt keeps rising. 

We asked about this position during budget Estimates ahead of Moody's and S&P making their determination and effectively giving a score to this government on their fiscal management. Moody's went first. They said:

The downgrade reflects a sharp and sustained increase in Tasmania's debt interest burdens, which has weakened the state's intrinsic financial strength. We expect these fiscal pressures to persist over the next few years. Net direct and indirect debt (NDID) has doubled from about 66 per cent of operating revenue in June 2019 to more than 130 per cent at June 2025 and absent countermeasures could surpass 180 per cent by fiscal 2029.

S&P also lowered the credit rating following this budget, which the former treasurer called a good budget. They looked at it and, I have to say, didn't agree. In their response they said:

Tasmania's budgetary metrics are very weak. We project cash operating deficits averaging around 3 per cent between fiscal 2025 and 2027, with a return to operating surplus possible in fiscal 2028. Tasmania's return to surplus relies heavily on tight cost control to contain operating expense growth to just 1.1 per cent per year between fiscal 2026 and 2028.

Deputy Chair, the problem with that is that it has very seldom, rarely happened in Tasmanian budgets. In fact, on two of the out years, the government is projecting that they will spend less than the year before. They are going from budgets where only a few years ago we had expenditure growth of 14 per cent under this Liberal government, under the former treasurer, Mr Ferguson, to now getting towards having negative expenditure growth and/or very, very small expenditure growth. This is going to be very difficult to do within the policy settings that they have, which is why people are so worried about next year's budget. 

People in the community sector are deeply, deeply concerned about the level of services that they can provide with their existing funding, but also what they are going to be left with at next year's budget. These are organisations that were promised five-year funding agreements back in 2014 and still don't have them. They are still living year-to-year, month-to-month on promises made or on writing grant deeds year to year to try and retain their staff, attract new staff and deliver the services that Tasmanians need. In this sort of context with an expenditure target that's been set very, very low, with 2800 public sector workers that are set to go; they are deeply concerned, and I don't blame them, there is going to be serious pain in the next budget.

This is predicated on reducing expenditure and on massive cash deficits, which are going to continue to increase the debt, and it didn't have to be this way. This is a policy choice. Every single one of these decisions has been made by the Liberal government. What we are left with is a government that's been in power for 11 years and has no one else to blame but themselves, which is why this is going to be so difficult for them to try and deal with. They are still trying to maintain that it is not their fault, even though there is no one else to blame, and variously they try and claim that there is actually no problem at all. There is a deep, deep problem. A serious problem that has been allowed to fester since the 2021 Fiscal Sustainability Report that I like to reference every time I speak on the budget, because that was the report that gave the warning and said the size of the corrective action gets harder the longer you wait to take decisions. In that report, it talked about in the short to medium term, things were manageable, but unless something is corrected, things are going to get much, much harder. Here we are, in the 25-26 Budget with things very, very hard and continuing to deteriorate.

There will be massive cuts written into the next budget: we've heard that, we understand that, and there will be at least 2800 public sector workers who will lose their jobs. Yet, the government continues to say during Estimates that it's about 'rightsizing' the public sector. It's about right sizing them. Now, if you accepted that the current size of the public sector is the wrong size, you have to ask who did it? The government is in saying they need to 'rightsize the public sector' is admitting that they made it the wrong size in the first place. It was only 12 months ago they were standing in this place talking about how they were going to turbocharge, on a recruiting blitz, adding more people into the public sector, and 12 months later it's, 'Actually, it's the wrong size now, so we're going to have to sack 2800 Tasmanian public sector workers' that deliver health, education, all the services everywhere from nurses, to teachers, to doctors to people that work in Parks and people that work in really important roles right across the public sector now have to be on watch, because they've been told by the government that set the public sector to the exact size it is today, that now it's the wrong size. This will cost Tasmania's budget hundreds of millions of dollars, it puts workers at serious risk and the services they provide at risk as well.

The size of the interest rate that we are currently paying will continue to rise as well because of the Moody's and S&P's decisions. We've been talking about interest rate settings at around five per cent as long as I've been here, but listening to the evidence from Mr Wallace, I think it was last week when he was talking generally about the stadium, he talked about interest rate increases now looking towards more like six per cent. What that means is that we will be paying more on interest. In terms of what the Treasurer's been talking about in terms of assets and infrastructure, the simple fact is we are borrowing now, to pay the interest. We are going to borrow at higher rates because of the credit downgrades that have been led and created by this Liberal government. They say this is a good budget; on no metric is this a good budget. This is a budget that has delivered two credit downgrades, that delivers a doubling of the debt and will continue to put added pressure on the services that Tasmanians rely on.

In terms of the Estimates position themselves, I want to talk about a couple of things that concern me straight off, particularly out of the Treasurer's hearing earlier in the week. I did expect coming into the questioning about TasInsure that perhaps I wouldn't like some of the answers, but what I didn't expect is that there wouldn't be any answers at all. We asked the Treasurer of Tasmania - and I believe in the other hearing, the Premier of Tasmania - about TasInsure. The Treasurer outlined in his answers that he has seen no modelling about Tasmania. He hasn't seen any modelling, he can't back up the claim of $250 per year saved. He couldn't talk about the 20 per cent proposed saving for businesses and he also accepted that he hadn't actually seen the bill that was in his name until the day that it was tabled.

The Treasurer of Tasmania, who as Treasurer is in charge of delivering the TasInsure policy, wasn't involved in the development of the bill, his department provided no advice to the development of the bill and then talked about how he believed that the department, now he didn't say definitely, but he believed that the bill had emanated out of the Department of Premier and Cabinet. We found out in another Estimates hearing that, in fact, it appears as though TasInsure has actually come from the Premier's office and I believe that the Premier's words - no, I won't quote him - but sounded like AI had been used in the development of the TasInsure policy bill. Quite extraordinary. 

There are no costings for this, there's no modelling around how you would actually deliver a $250 saving, there's no detail about how the policy will actually work. It's not clear whether the government plans to use the MAIB balance sheet, and that's how they'll deliver the supposed savings or whether they'll use reinsurance. If they use reinsurance, frankly, it is impossible for them to deliver what they're talking about, and if they use the MAIB balance sheet, it's probably still impossible for them to deliver it, but almost certainly, they won't be able to because MAIBs balance sheet, despite it being significant - I think over $2 billion, don't quote me on that - quite significant - well quote me on it, it's in Hansard, I'll check it later - it is significant, but it's not going to be enough to back this in. 

They've gone out for consultation on a policy with zero detail, a Treasurer that wasn't involved in the creation of the bill, you have modelling that doesn't exist, despite the fact that the Premier told Tasmanians that the reason he wasn't releasing the business case or the modelling is because he didn't want the competitors to see it - actually just didn't exist. He made it up.

Then we had the scenes around MAIB itself. The MAIB chair had not seen the policy, wasn't consulted. Minister Vincent wasn't aware of TasInsure when he was asked, I believe, by Ms Dow in that Estimates hearing, so the shareholder minister for MAIB doesn't know about the policy, the MAIB Chair doesn't know about the policy, the Treasurer, even though the bill's in his name, doesn't know about the policy. There's no detail. They can't tell us if there's reinsurance, they can't tell us if they can use MAIB's balance sheet. All this leads you to one conclusion, that this is a fairy tale. It is totally made-up. It is no more than a cap, a jacket, a stubby holder and an empty shopfront designed to trick Tasmanians, designed to give false hope to Tasmanians and Tasmanian businesses that desperately need support. 

Insurance is a real issue. It is an issue with every business I've spoken to. I can't remember if I've told people in this House or not but I remember speaking to one business in a regional area who told me that their insurance costs had gone from I think it was $20,000 to $100,000 in one year. I asked, 'How are you going to cope with that? What are you going to do?' He said to me, 'I'm not going to pay it. We're just not going to be insured.' That's the dead-set approach and it is frightening for him and I feel desperately for him. My advice to him was, very strongly, 'That's a very bad idea.' 

This is not an approach that should be taken. It's a real issue that needs a real solution and TasInsure is not a real solution. The figures are made-up. The detail is not scarce, it doesn't exist. The consultation piece is pretty flimsy, and the bill itself simply appears to establish a government business and that's it. It doesn't talk about how it will actually be paid for. It's clever politics, it's terrible policy, it has delivered false hope to so many Tasmanians who are doing it tough, who don't deserve to be dealt with in this way.

Once you get onto the sport portfolio, I'm not the shadow Sports minister. I am happy to sit in on behalf of Mr Edmunds in the other place. I have two things, I really wanted to talk about and two things I am really passionate about. One is the North Launceston Footy Club. I was really excited to reengage with Adrian Hall not so long ago about the future of North Launceston Football Club. It was also on behalf of Bullets Poker not so long ago when we saved pub poker. I've known Adrian for a long time and he's someone that has that footy club at his very heart and soul and he's working hard, like so many volunteers do, to try and make that club better, to try and save its home.

Somewhere along the line between the Launceston City Council, Stadiums Tasmania and this Liberal government, during the $130 million redevelopment plans for York Park, someone forgot something that's not so insignificant. It's the 100-year tenant of York Park, the North Launceston Football Club. The Devils are going to be fantastic but it can't be at the expense of community sport and that's what this is being set up for. The North Launceston Footy Club needs to leave that ground by the end of the 2027 season, so let's say September 2027.

Their number one ask of me and I'm sure of the Liberals during the election campaign was they wanted to stay at York Park. They said, surely, we can be facilitated within the existing envelope, and I did my due diligence. I spoke to a few people who asked, 'Is it possible?' I said, 'yes, it's possible to keep them there', so that was our policy - to keep them at York Park because I didn't see that they should be kicked out. The Devils would be fantastic but the key tenant could remain as the North Launceston Footy Club, so I was really happy and proud to stand with Adrian, a couple of players, with our Labor candidates for Bass, to back in a really important club.

I was devastated when I got the answer from Mr Duigan. As I said earlier, I wasn't expecting that answer, but it made me feel bad and almost guilty for having backed the club in because they were going to get $100,000. They have a draft letter that said:

We're going to move you to Invermay Park and we'll give you $100,000 to get started on the work.

And even if they did get the $100,000 in this budget, and I wish it was there, it would have been really tough for them to get the timelines to line up by September 2027, but they would have had a chance.

It's not my policy, it's not their preferred policy, but getting $100,000 to investigate their future at another location is definitely better than nothing at all. That's why when I spoke to Adrian not long ago - I believe it was a couple of days before Estimates - about how things were going just to check in and he fully expected and believed that the $100,000 was still there on the table. One of the reasons we asked that question today was when you told the club that they weren't getting $100,000, and the question wasn't answered, the answer is they were never told.

I want to put on the record, I feel devastated for the club. They're a great club, a long-term club. It wasn't a political question. I didn't expect the answer I got but I got one of the worst answers that I can imagine has ever been given in this place - a vindictive answer, an arrogant answer and an answer that puts the minister's own community at risk. This is a member for Windermere, right? North Launceston Footy Club's half of the players, half the supporters would live in his electorate. As put earlier today by Ms Greene, his electorate office is opposite their home ground. He was prepared to put his own ego ahead of the club, their players, their supporters and no one on that side is prepared to call him out for it. What's going on here?

The level of vindictiveness, the attack on good people and volunteers of a club is not the biggest issue. We're talking about a $10 billion budget and this is $100,000, but it goes to the very heart of this government.

The same thing as we saw last year with Don up at Mud Bar, who was - you know- really pouring his heart and soul out, standing next to me doing media and because he did that, the former Sports minister cancelled the dinner the next night.

Ms Haddad - Shame. So vindictive.

Mr WINTER - You know, 'You're not going to back us in publicly. If you are going to do anything with our political opponents, we will punish you.' That goes to the very character of the people on the other side of the House and if you sit back and do nothing, if you don't say anything to Minister Duigan or the Premier about this, then you are just as culpable like the attack on the good people of Launceston - like this, it stinks.

The other question I asked about this in the sports portfolio is about the high performance centre in Kingston. I'm really deeply concerned about the answers I got. Again, I wasn't expecting the answers I got. The minister has been there for a while now and should be able to answer questions like this. In the budget it outlines that, instead of capital spending at the High Performance Centre in Kingston, it's now going to turn into operating expenses because they're giving it and they do not name it up in the budget, but someone else is going to deliver it.

I asked the question and now the Devils, and between the Devils and the AFL, are going to deliver the High Performance Centre in Kingston. I thought, well this sounds like a good thing, so I asked whether this mean that costs are capped now, that we won't spend any more than the $115 million there and then I think it's an extra $25 million, are the costs capped? The answer was yes; the costs are now capped and that the club will take any additional expenditure. Now, that is good, I think.

Unfortunately, the minister came back later and told us actually, that's wrong. We are on the hook for cost overruns. Not only are the Devils and the AFL now delivering the high performance centre, but if they overspend or over budget, we pay for it anyway. Two problems with that, there's that problem, but also the fact that the minister did not know that taxpayers were on the hook and had to be corrected and come back to correct. The record shows a devastating lack of due diligence about that project. I also asked about the associated infrastructure because I am deeply concerned, not just about the North Launceston Football Club, but I am concerned about the Kingborough Tigers Footy Club and also the Kingborough Knights down there at the Twin Ovals.

They went into this willingly and, in fact, I think enthusiastically around getting the high performance centre down and I can understand why. Putting the high performance centre in Kingston puts it very close to the JackJumpers High Performance Centre and Kingston High and the sports centre; it is going to be an incredible sporting precinct but again, we can't forget the really important community clubs here. There must be a focus on making sure that those clubs do not become homeless like the North Launceston Footy Club probably will be.

I wasn't able to get answers around how this infrastructure will be timed and spread out to make sure it can be delivered and also, I wasn't able to get answers about the really important associated infrastructure that I know Mayor Paula Wriedt was insistent on when this deal went through, that the Spring Farm Link Road, which is really important, was incorporated in the deal and the answer was that wasn't funded. Gormley Road, the car parking, all of the associated infrastructure, and those answers still aren't there yet. Frankly, it's quite extraordinary that those answers aren't there yet because this is a project that's been going on for a long time.

Now, the high performance centre is supposed to be finished at the end of this year according to the AFL deal. We actually just got it approved last night and the government is very pleased about that. I am as well, but the timelines on this are already very - well, it was a year to decide whether it should go to Eastern Shore or Kingborough and it needs to be delivered for the club. It's already in breach of what's written down in the contract and very deeply disappointing.

Racing - in the 3.5 minutes that I have got left, I've said quite a lot about this already and I am trying to remember which bits we did in Estimates and which we did in GBE to make sure I am consistent with what happened in Estimates. The major point I want to make on this shutdown at greyhound racing - which, of course, the minister stood in this place a year ago and said would not happen, wrote an op-ed and said would not happen. The Premier wrote letters and backed in the industry and Minister Ellis said racing was part of Tasmania's way of life. What the government is doing here is rushed. They do not know. They haven't got any details, they haven't done their proper consultation. If this does sadly go through, there's nothing about compensation. I am deeply concerned about the mental health impacts on Tasmanians who tell me that, for some people, this is all they've got. Their family is the people they see, the greyhound track. Their family is their dogs. We heard from Claire Robins last week about the impact that racing has had on her.

From a financial position, the fact there's no deed means there's no certainty. I am deeply concerned about the impact that this shutdown will have on the other two codes. I don't think it's honest; I don't think there is any evidence to back up the claims that this won't impact the other two codes. If greyhound racing is shut down - and I desperately hope it isn't - there will be significant risks for the other two codes, for harness and thoroughbred racing, and for those participants. Word is starting to get around the industries, the other two codes, about what the risks are for them. The risks are significant. They are real. 

We already heard, during Estimates, the Greens starting to ask more questions. Usually it's all about greyhounds, but the minister was copping more questions from the Greens about horse racing, because they've already moved their sights. When you hear Premier Jeremy Rockliff or when you hear Minister Jane Howlett say they are totally committed to the other two codes, you cannot believe them, because that's what they told greyhounds only three months ago. You can't believe a single word they say. You can believe the Greens on this, because they've been consistent. Yes, they've focused very heavily on greyhounds, but now they're turning their sights to thoroughbred and harness racing. The question is, when they tell the Premier that they want those two codes gone, what will he say this time? Last time they said they wanted harness and thoroughbred racing gone, he said yes. He rolled over and did over all those people that have backed him, his government, for years - his minister included.

With that level of uncertainty that's pervaded through the Budget, through Estimates, with a government that can't be trusted, with a government that is prepared to do over community organisations like the North Launceston Football Club, like the Launceston, Devonport and Hobart greyhound racing clubs, it's hard to have confidence in this government that it is going to do the right thing by Tasmanians.

[5.03 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Chair, I rise to give my reply to the Estimates process. Upfront, I want to acknowledge the process and thank everyone involved in it - parliamentary staff who moved heaven on earth to make it happen - not least with GBEs following - the services staff as well. I want to acknowledge our team, who work tirelessly to assist us with the questions. Also, I want to acknowledge the chairs of the committees. Honourable Chair, you did a great job, as did Mr Fairs. I thought you were fair and even-handed. 

This Budget is deeply concerning, and corrective action is needed. During the election, we Greens showed that you can deliver that kind of corrective action. We showed that there was a billion dollars worth of savings that could be made in the Budget. We showed that there was $900 million worth of revenue that could be earned by making big corporations pay their fair share, and when we included additional expenditure, we showed that the Budget could be $1.4 billion dollars better off overall. 

It is possible, and it has been really made clear by people, including Dr Saul Eslake, that the state of the Budget is purely down to decisions - policy decisions of this government. It's not down to COI, it's not down to COVID, it's down to policy decisions.

Saul Eslake said: 

Drawing on publicly available information, the Review finds that the deterioration in the financial position of Tasmania’s 'general government sector' - that is, state government departments and agencies funded primarily by taxation revenue or grants from the Federal Government - over the past decade is entirely attributable to 'policy decisions' by government (to increase 'operating' or recurrent expenses, and spending on infrastructure projects, and to a lesser extent to reduce taxes).

We've seen this government engage in pork barrelling, refusing to raise revenue and to set infrastructure budgets that are exorbitant - synonymously characterised, obviously, by the stadium.

The Pre-Election Financial Outlook (PEFO) showed in its key findings that the Budget has a structural problem, and that despite the fact that the government talking about rivers of gold coming, the Treasury, unfettered by the hand of the Treasurer in the PEFO during caretaker period, said that:

Economic growth correlates weakly with general government sector revenue growth in Tasmania. Accordingly, this structural problem will not be resolved through future economic growth.

Explicit policy choices are required. We need those policy choices - we need them desperately, because with our credit rating now being downgraded, the state of the Budget is going to get even worse. Debt is going to get more expensive, and it will come at a cost to our services.

The first thing this government should do is drop the Macquarie Point stadium, because that is unnecessary debt for a third AFL stadium that will get ever more expensive. Instead, it's focused on cuts. It stood up the efficiency and productivity unit that's looking across departments for places to find savings - 2800 public servants over the coming years. In the Budget consultation papers, it's writing to community service organisations asking them for suggestions as to what they can cut. These are people who are providing critical services to our community, and they are being asked to find the cuts to their own services. It's insulting. If you turn on the television or read the newspaper in any one week, you hear story after story of people doing it hard. Whether it's the Chigwell community garden that has to close down, the Hobart City Mission that can't meet the needs of its community, or things like jacking up TAFE fees for really important courses, you can see that there are cuts and hikes going on everywhere. 

Of course, the stadium sits central to a lot of this - $1.8 billion over the next 10 years, a contaminated site, so it's high-risk. A high risk of delay; delays equal cost overruns. There are high-impact effects - and I will talk about some of this later - the Cenotaph, the heritage precinct of Hobart, and the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra. There are significant issues.

It was good to have the opportunity to directly put to the Treasurer, in an Estimates-type process, questions about some of these things. Questions about debt and servicing debt, $10.4 billion by the end of the forward Estimates - that's almost double, and that doesn't include the debt being carried by government businesses and non-financial government corporations.

This Budget is a matter of choices. The government is actively choosing to prioritise things like the stadium, and things like not raising revenue by making corporations pay their fair share. They're making us, the community, pay as a result, and it's baking in an absolute mirage to this so-called interim Budget. The notion of a surplus, albeit a modest surplus of $5 million, at the end of the forward Estimates is an absolute mirage. We know that the forward Estimates for many critical services are blanked out, and they are things that will need to be funded. Things like 26Ten, which I raised during the committee process with minister Jo Palmer, and the school lunch program. These are things that the government is working on strategies to deliver, yet hasn't put in funding beyond 2026, because that's when the current funding ends. We know that they're going to need to do these things. We hope they're going to give funding to these things. If they're not, it's an even bigger indictment on this government. 

The point I want to make is that the notion of the surplus is an absolute mirage. This Budget has been reverse-engineered to find a surplus in 2028-29 and work it backwards from there. I mentioned the public service reductions - we know that the budget coming is going to be way worse than this one itself, and 2800 public service jobs are in the crosshairs of this government.

When it comes to the stadium, it was great to talk to the Treasurer about implications of the stadium. It's had four cost blowouts. It seems there is no upper limit to the price tag the government is willing to spend on this stadium. The commitment of '$375 million and not one red cent more' by the Premier that was clearly announced day one of election 2024 was clearly all about neutralising the issue during the 2024 election. The Premier was completely undermined by his Treasurer, who completely contradicted him. The Premier has often said that borrowings are not capital, and when he said that capital was $375 million and not one red cent more, the Treasurer, Mr Abetz, said, 'Borrowings are clearly going to be part of the capital input'.

Unfortunately for the Premier, the charade of 'not one red cent more than $375 million' has been blown out of the water by his own Treasurer.

The Treasurer did not get advice from Treasury about scenario mapping about how much this will cost if it blows out by a certain amount. He has no modelling or evidence around the rivers of gold. He talks about payroll tax; he talks about land tax. However, in listening to the Treasurer and the Premier you would think this stadium is going to deliver some incredible bonanza. Don't worry about the experts who say that's not going to happen. Don't worry about the fact that the Planning Commission and Martin Wallace the other day said that that's not going to happen, that other experts presented to the upper House said that all the evidence looking at stadia around the world shows that that river of gold, that bonanza will not come. Put that aside. If you ask the Treasurer about what he bases his claims on, has he got modelling from Treasury, does he have evidence to substantiate that? It is clearly 'no'.

Servicing the debt: the Macquarie Point Development Corporation is going to borrow $490 million. The government itself is going to borrow $375 million simply to service the Macquarie Point debt of $490 million - this is pre-credit rating downgrade - which is going to cost up to $32 million a year. It's an incredible amount of money and, as Martin Wallace said the other day, it is compounding and it will cost more and more every year because we are going to be borrowing money to pay the interest on borrowed money. This is ludicrous and, as Martin Wallace said, an untenable situation.

Of course, the GBE debt is unsustainable as well. I will talk a little bit about Homes Tasmania later, but it is really clear that this government is effectively using the GBE sector - public, non-financial corporations - as vehicles to carry debt so it doesn't sit on the general government sector budget.

In the Treasury portfolio, it was good to ask questions about the mandatory precommitment card. The Finance portfolio has responsibility for that and we again pushed the government on the release of reports, the Deloitte's report, and other evidence around their position and, of course, to push them on leading the nation. Don't follow the nation when it comes to this because this is something that we can do. We know the damage that poker machines do in our communities. Millions and millions of dollars - $17 million stripped out of our communities every single year. This is the evidence. The mandatory precommitment card was the evidence and was the recommendation of the Liquor and Gaming Commission.

The community support levy which is drawn from poker machine revenues is supposed to be handed out to community support organisations to help people with problem gambling. It's a levy of $7.5 million. There's a balance of $2.4 million being held at the moment. Why is it that the government is withholding money that it is collecting from gambling profits to assist with problem gambling? It should be divvied out. It's ridiculous to think that that's not the case.

TasInsure was an interesting conversation to participate in. Despite the fact that Tasmania tops the list when it comes to the National Climate Risk Assessment, this government seems to think that TasInsure is a good idea because it means that Tasmanians won't have to cover for the exorbitant cost of insuring and paying out on claims from bushfires, cyclones and other natural disasters and floods in northern Australia and on the mainland, but, of course, the government has absolutely no modelling to back this up.

I remember sitting in this place once over the last couple of years and the Premier looking across at Mr Winter when he was opposition leader and levelling the accusation at him, 'Mr Winter, you're all shopfront and no shelves,' meaning you have no substance and you're all façade. If there was ever a policy position that is all shopfront and no shelves, it's this when it comes to TasInsure.

The Tasmanian Audit Office came for half an hour and to the Treasurer's credit - I want to pay credit where credit's due - he effectively stepped back from that conversation and allowed questions to be asked directly of the Audit Office and for them to be answered. That was very welcome. The Auditor-General was really clear on TT-Line when he said, 'I haven't been presented with anything that would change my opinion at this point of time'. Meaning, that, in his mind, TT-Line is still insolvent. GBE debt, it was a concern in the PEFO and TT-Line is clearly a concern front of mind when it comes to the Audit Office, but there are concerns being raised about others. Of course, we asked questions about the Wilkinsons Point land sale and the fact that the Audit Office couldn't get access to Cabinet documents that would have helped their analysis.

When it came to the stadium and Macquarie Point urban renewal, with the Minister for Macquarie Point Urban Renewal, it was, again, an exercise in uncovering the ludicrous house of cards upon which the Macquarie Point Stadium is to be built. We have, on one hand, the Tasmanian Planning Commission's expert evidence saying don't build it, the stadium should not proceed and, on the other hand, we have a really flimsy - basically a PR pamphlet from the government that reruns all the same arguments that have been run and lost and puts up a few comments from punters on the street or vested interests. 

Of course, when it comes to urban renewal, the Tasmanian Planning Commission is utterly clear that putting the stadium in that spot is not going to leave enough room to activate the site. I listened to the Tasmanian Planning Commission before the Legislative Council committee the other day. It was fantastic to see Shelley Penn AM, the architect who is on that panel, unpack exactly why it is the case that there is too little room and not enough access. It is going to be unsafe for people to be walking around there. It's not going to be a commercial venture.

It is Mac Point Urban Renewal in name only when it comes to this portfolio. But when it comes to the $490.7 million that the Mac Point Development Corporation is going to borrow, the state government is clearly going to guarantee all those borrowings. When the Treasurer accepted the $375 million that the government will be borrowing is added to the $490.7 million, the government will be borrowing at least $865.7 million to build the Macquarie Point Stadium and, as mentioned, simply servicing the Mac Point debt - the $490 million-worth of debt - is going to cost $32 million from the general government sector. This is the same sector where we pay nurses and teachers, and give out money to community service organisations.

When it comes comes to private sector investment, the minister said they have not taken that off the table. The correct terminology might be 'deferred it,' but clearly there's been a lack of interest there. When it comes to paying down capital borrowings, the minister points to the commercial returns that will be generated from site redevelopment. However, if you do listen to the experts, like the Tasmanian Planning Commission, the returns are going to be pretty marginal there because urban renewal is going to be very difficult to deliver.

As for the NRE land that's to be transferred to the Macquarie Point Development Corporation for housing, which is a requirement of the $240 million being given by the federal government, is yet to be transferred. Moreover, in the Tasmanian Planning Commission's evidence, they basically said that there couldn't be a worse place for housing development. It is isolated from the city, right next to an industrial site - the working port - and full of hazards for residents. It's the worst possible place to put a housing development.

We asked some questions about the Aboriginal culturally informed zone. While the previous master plan for Mac Point had truth and reconciliation front and centre, the Aboriginal culturally informed zone is a real titbit that's left on the outside of the stadium that Prof Greg Lehman, has described as, and I quote, '... gestures amount to what I would characterise as a typical example of what is commonly called "Black-cladding"'. [OK]

Under questioning we found out that the Aboriginal culturally informed zone is not funded as part of the $1.13 billion of the stadium expenditure. It will be developed in the first instance, I imagine, as simple pavement. Then, if this thing is ever built, additional money will have to be spent over time to deliver that zone, if at all.

When it comes to the Sport portfolio with minister Duigan, it was really clear that the government has not yet considered what's going to happen to the debt that's associated with the stadium when it comes to transferring it from Macquarie Point Development Corporation to Stadiums Tasmania.

The question was, when you transfer the stadium from one entity to another, does the debt go with it? That's the normal thing that would happen with debt. However, as minister Duigan said, this is not a scenario that has been contemplated. We found out during questioning that sports betting, that advertising for gambling inside the stadium, that there is no current policy position to preclude that kind of betting, and that 90 per cent of the advertising inside the stadium actually comes with the tenants. If you get the AFL and their relationship with sports betting companies, you get their baggage as well. You get their gambling advertising and there's no capacity to preclude gambling advertising in the stadium and it seems there's no intent to do so. 

I was shocked to hear the response from the minister, Mr Duigan, under questioning from Mr Winter in relation to the North Launceston Football Club and that funding. I find that outcome really disrespectful and indecent as a response. It's great to see our member for Bass, Ms Rosol, put on the record today that there should be an apology, there should be a demonstration of respect and decency, and that money should be honoured.

Chair, when it comes to the environment, it's obviously critical to our brand and our economy. We pride ourselves on being clean and green. Of course, the State of the Environment Report was an absolute wakeup call for Tasmania and Tasmanians, but it seems not for this government. Of 29 indicators, 55 per cent - more than half of them - were deteriorating, 21 per cent were stable, 7 per cent are improving, and 17 per cent are unknown. It's a shocking indictment on a decade of Liberal policy and funding priorities. The report made several recommendations, including:

develop a long-term vision and strategy for Tasmania's environment
explore opportunities to collaborate with the Aboriginal community
establish more marine protected areas
remove protections for wild fallow deer from regulatory frameworks and invest in and expand the terrestrial reserve estate.

When you look at the Budget, there are no dollars in it to implement the State of the Environment Report recommendations. There's nothing explicit there. We know from the government's response to the State of the Environment Report that few have been picked up and many have, or some have been, completely rejected. Many others have been acknowledged in part and they will be delivered in part. It's simply not good enough. 

If we are going to maintain that clean, green brand, we need to be funding elements and we need to be funding the protection of our environment and indeed the restoration of our environment. The EPA was in the room when it came to the environment portfolio and Dr Woodruff extensively questioned them about florfenicol and antibiotic use in salmon farms and found a shocking figure: 700 kilograms of florfenicol had been released into the D'Entrecasteaux Channel in less than two weeks. Absolutely shocking. Of course, there are many concerns when it comes to the EPA needing new teeth, needing new laws to be able to implement and to regulate. 

One of the most shocking revelations under questioning of the EPA was its intervention, its appeal in a legal case to try to block Mine Watch Meander Valley, which has been joined to a legal case by TASCAT. EPA is using public money to appeal to the Federal Court to try to block that community group from that appeal. It's a shocking indictment. The motivation for this, according to the EPA, is all about law and in regard to appropriate processes. For some reason the EPA sees it appropriate to intervene to try to block a community group from participating and exercising its legal rights to challenge a mine in its local area. It confirmed that there's no upper limit on what's being spent.

Threatened species protection was a feature of the State of the Environment Report. We're seeing precious little of it when it comes to the swift parrot and when it comes to the loss of potential breeding and foraging habitat, the government's own recovery plan for the swift parrot  shows that loss of potential breeding habitat in Tasmania via clearance for conversion to agriculture, native forest logging and intensive native forests silviculture, continues to reduce the amount of available swift parrot nesting and foraging habitat and therefore remains a significant threat to the continued persistence of the species.

We had no answer from the minister when pushed on increasing habitat protection for the swift parrot. We had no answer from the minister when it came to logging at Lonnavale and the declaration of a swift parrot important breeding habitat over that area. The only thing the government can point to when it comes to the protection of habitat for species is private land conservation and, even in that regard, it's failed to meet its targets. 

It was welcome to have a conversation with the EPA about the Lake Rosebery oil spill because that was a response that appeared to be very well managed. We asked questions about legacy site auditing, about how many of these legacy industrial sites are out there in the landscape and what they are doing to understand it and address it. It does seem that there are steps being taken, which is really welcome. 

It was refreshing to have a conversation with minister Vincent in the chair when it came to housing. I find his answers real and really honest, despite the fact that he has some significant challenges, not least in the Housing portfolio. The Homes Tasmania review identified a whole range of different issues and implementation needs to be delivered, but it seems that next year's budget is where most of those outcomes are going to be found.

Homes Tasmania debt is now shocking. It's $500 million now and trending towards a billion dollars at the end of the forward Estimates. It's going to cost us $25 million now to service this debt. It'll cost us $50 million at the end of the forward Estimates. Meanwhile, the priority wait list is 5336 people, which is over 8180 people. There were questions asked, I acknowledge not by myself, this is a question I've thought about a lot, about how many actual people sit behind those 5336 applications and it is at least 8000 people based on the numbers that were provided.

It's really clear that short stay accommodation needs to be reined in. Treasury has estimates as to what could be generated through the short stay levy. It's welcome to see a commitment for that to be implemented next year, but it means that we've done ourselves out of $22 million in the two years that we've now been delayed.

What was very welcome in the conversation with Homes Tasmania was the acknowledgement that the private rental market is broken. The CEO of Homes Tasmania made it really clear and I quote, when we're talking about private rental issues - 'those are important things for all governments to think about, but private rental in Australia is broken'. I concur with that. We need rent control, we need no cause evictions, we need minimum standards and at the federal level it's clear that we need to deal with capital gains tax and negative gearing.

When it came to the Energy portfolio and minister Duigan, it is shocking. It was good to put to him and push him on the fact that his federal parliament colleagues have abandoned the target of net zero emissions. It's an indictment on the federal Liberals.

When it comes to Marinus and the North West Transmission Developments, it's a key issue. The scale of the development and the scale of the investment is absolutely astounding. $191 million in the budget this year for TasNetworks and that's on top of $103 million in the last year's budget. What was shocking for many of us in here, was the willingness of the government to make a decision to invest in Marinus Link during the caretaker period despite the red flags in the whole-of-state business case.

It has raised red flags with the structure of the NEM with the increase in transmission costs and the government. Those increased transmission costs are well understood, and acknowledged by government, but they say that they're going to be mitigated by wholesale power prices being reduced and by Hydro Tasmania's super profits. However, when it came to the push and shove, and when we read some quotes into Hansard in Estimates, the Deloitte's report actually drafted to inform the whole-of-state business case, shows that there would be a 59 per cent increase in wholesale energy prices with a Marinus Link scenario versus a no Marinus Link scenario. Again, another house of cards. The whole argument for Marinus and the North West Transmission is built on these arguments where experts give advice, departmental officials give another advice and government go with that.

Meanwhile, Hydro profits are reducing, there's no dividend this year. Despite the fact that there's $470 million of super profits forecast into the future, absolutely no modelling was produced. No river flow modelling either. It's all based on river flow inflows into the dams and despite a pre-Basslink river flow assessment way back in 2001, it appears that Hydro has not done the work on assessing the inflows into its dams. We did have the opportunity to raise the issue about biofuels and the fact that all of these different biofuel proposals that are popping up across the landscape come at significant risk. The budget itself identifies some of these risks, and as far as we're concerned, we will identify one of the risks and that is native forest logging.

I only have a minute left. Through the Veterans' portfolio we had the opportunity to push the minister again on the Cenotaph. It's going to be 100 years old in a couple of weeks' time and it's going to be significantly impacted by the stadium. I also pushed the minister on recognising Aboriginal veterans' and veterans from the Black War here in Tasmania.

When it comes to minister Ogilvie, in the Arts and Heritage space, again, the heritage value of the Cenotaph was raised and the commitment of the RSL to it. I raised the issue of TMAG's leaking roof, and the fact that when I went to a presentation there a couple of weeks ago, there was a bucket on the floor in the middle of the central gallery. Also, the TMAG holds Aboriginal remains. They've managed to repatriate one third of the remains, but the balance is yet to be repatriated, and something needs to happen in that space.

We know the May 2027 Budget is going to cut deeper. We know it's going to cost Tasmanians dearly.

[5.33 p.m.]
Ms HOWLETT - Chair, I firstly thank the department officials and their teams for the work in preparation for the Estimates hearing. I greatly appreciate their assistance, and I'd also like to thank the Chair of Committees as well. I also thank members in the House and the other place in their role in scrutinising the interim Budget, to ensure it continues to deliver for Tasmania, which it does.

We're focused on delivery and building a strong Tasmania now and into the future. We detailed investments in health, education and community safety and we will continue to strongly support our job-rich visitor economy sector, our racing industry and strongly support the prevention of sexual violence and family violence, and importantly, investment in job creating intergenerational infrastructure. To ensure that government can support and care for Tasmanians, we need to keep building and growing a strong economy. Our plan is to make Tasmania the best place to live, work, raise a family and do business.

I was pleased to detail to the committee that the Budget contained significant investment in our visitor economy. Under the Tasmanian Liberal government, funding for destination marketing has continued to increase. Last financial year we delivered $10 million of marketing funding and in this interim Budget we delivered the same amount for 25-26, and this is committed for 26-27. I will continue to fight for further investment in this industry, including through destination marketing, as the return on investment numbers speak for themselves.

We're continuing to deliver the tourism and hospitality support package to support the industry. As part of the package, we have delivered on our election commitment to recommence Eat Local, Stay Local Voucher program. More than 26,000 voucher claims have been paid since then.

The interim Budget continued our support for the Aviation Attraction Fund and I'm excited that the first ever direct flight between Hobart and Newcastle operated by Jetstar has landed now at 5.25 p.m. so that is incredibly exciting and this brand new route was unlocked through the Aviation Fund and it opens up Tasmania to a catchment of around 1.4 million people in the Greater Hunter region. 

We estimate visitors travelling on this route will contribute $41.5 million in spend into the Tasmanian economy over this season. It also outlined the funding priorities not part of this interim budget will be considered as part of the 2026-27 budget development process.

I outlined our ongoing support for the hardworking hospitality business operators across our state. In 2024, we committed $8.4 million over three years to Hospitality Tasmania through the Hospitality 2030 strategy to deliver initiatives to build and grow this job rich sector. This includes through the great customer experience, hospital health and programs focusing on business sustainability and workforce development, like the Women in Leadership program, for example. 

I was also asked about our continued support for the Tasmanian Hospitality and Tourism Academy to address skill shortages and labour shortages. I was pleased to detail that our event strategy 2023-27 continues to deliver a strong return on investment to the state and the budget provides strong support.

Events drive visitation to Tasmania, especially through the quieter months, building local communities and culture and supporting our tourism and hospitality businesses. I outline that in the 2024-25 financial year, the government supported a total of 155 events. This support brought over 129 200 visitors to Tasmania and generated over 742 700 bed nights.

The budget also provides funding for important major partnerships such as Hawthorn Football Club agreement renewal. Our commitment to deliver additional games in 2028 and 2029 means that UTAS Stadium will see more AFL content than ever before.

I advise the committee that Women and the Prevention of Family Violence are combined under one budget portfolio and output. The two are fundamentally linked, and we know that women disproportionately experience family violence and that improving gender equality outcomes fosters a safer environment for both women and girls.

I outlined to the committee that this year our government increased its support for our International Women's Day grants programs. Eliminating family and sexual violence is a key priority for our government. In the short and medium term, we know that family and sexual violence reporting rates have increased as more victim survivors gain trust, informal support and response systems as well as increased understanding about the nature of family and sexual violence.

Our government's third Family in Sexual Violence Action Plan 2022-27 survivors at the Centre is supported by funding of $140 million over 5 years to deliver vital actions which include additional Arch Centre funding since the action plan commenced. I was asked about an Arch Centre program.

Our centres in the north and south of the state are delivering a survivor-centred, holistic and integrated response to family and sexual violence and we are delivering a third arch centre in the north west which is expected to be operational in early 2026.

In my portfolio of racing, I was pleased to affirm our support for the broader racing industry, its participants and our regional communities. Work has started on a new racing industry funding deed to ensure the financial sustainability of Tasmanian racing industry continues. Importantly, this is not a review into whether there will be funding, it's a review of what the funding model will look like beyond 2029 for thoroughbred and harness racing codes.

I was able to detail the delivery of a strong plan for the biggest reforms in racing industry in decades. This includes the state's first racing Integrity Commissioner, Mr Sean Carroll. Mr Carroll was able to take questions and detail how he has hit the ground running with the immediate establishment of a complaints management framework, and how he has started working on assessment of the code of practice for racehorse welfare.

Chair, in conclusion, I was pleased to be able to outline how the Budget delivers for Tasmania, how the Budget backs in businesses, supports jobs, supports family, and builds stronger and safer communities, and importantly, with the future of our great state in mind. 

[5.41 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD - Deputy Chair, I look forward to making a contribution on two portfolio areas - first of all, my shadow portfolios of Justice and Attorney-General - and to reflect on some of what we discussed at the table with Mr Barnett.

First of all, I asked the minister about a very important project called the Astria Project. It might sound a little bit boring because it's an IT project, but it's actually a very vital project that's designed to connect the IT systems of everyone involved with the justice system, so from police to courts to the prison and everyone in between. It was initiated through legislation that passed through this place, I believe, almost nine years ago, eight or so years ago, and it's been going on for a very long time. Much to the frustration of practitioners, both prosecution and defence lawyers and people working in the prison and court systems, there is still far too much that happens in a paper-based way across those parts of the justice system. People are very much holding on for the Astria Project to be delivered. Not only is it important in terms of the work that goes on in those sectors, but it's a critical part of delivering access to justice. We know there are massive delays across our court systems in Tasmania, and they are referred to year on year in the annual reports of the Magistrates Court and Supreme Court. Many of those access-to-justice delays are caused through issues of sharing information. It should be so simple, and yet it isn't. 

The Astria Project was tended out to a company called Fujitsu, and the reason that I've continued to ask questions year after year about that project is that Fujitsu have a pretty poor record when it comes to delivering on significant IT projects. For example, they were commissioned to do a similar project to this one for the Queensland Department of Health that totally failed, and it cost their government another $1.2 billion to fix it. They were involved with a similar project again for the Health Department in Western Australia - and I had to double-check these figures - but that blew out to $175 million due to poor governance from Fujitsu. Outside Australia, they were also involved with some work for the United Kingdom Government on the Horizon IT system which led to wrongful convictions of hundreds of postmasters across the UK. Some of you might have read about that in the media. So, I do have worries about the deliverability of this project and the effect that it's going to have on access to justice in Tasmania.

The original budget for that project, when first allocated, was around about $16.6 million, and there was money added to it year-on-year through various budgets.

The minister gave some figures at the table. The total contribution so far to the project has been just over $32 million, as well as vendor costs to Fujitsu of $17.146 million. It's pretty clear that already we seem to be heading down a similar path to what happened in the United Kingdom, Western Australia and Queensland. That's project is really vital for the government to deliver on, because it has a critical effect on access to justice. It's all very well for the government to have a tough-on-crime agenda and a tough-on-crime mantra, which we hear all of the time from some of the more conservative members of that caucus, but that doesn't work if you don't -

Mr Ellis - Party rooms.

Ms HADDAD - Don't you say 'caucus'?

Mr Ellis - No, party room.

Ms HADDAD - My apologies. Mr Ellis, I'm looking at you.

With respect, to have a tough-on-crime agenda you actually have to fund all of the parts of the justice system for that to be effective, and actually have what they believe is going to be an effect on the crime rates. I have a different philosophical approach to that. Nonetheless the funding of the entire justice system is what is the point here. We need to fund all aspects - from police through to someone being convicted, spending time in prison and receiving rehabilitation services so that they, hopefully, don't continue to offend. Without funding that whole system, we are really failing Tasmanians - both victims of crime and those who want to rehabilitate. 

That certainly was relevant, as well, to the conversation that we had around funding of the community legal assistance sector. It was acknowledged by both sides of the table that yes, we want more money from the federal government. I've certainly made that clear to my federal colleagues, as I know the Attorney-General has. The fact is the national partnership agreement that funds the community legal assistance sector through the state governments is a two-sided agreement. There is also an obligation and an expectation on state governments to do their bit; to make sure they are doing their part to fund these vital services. Again, this is an access to justice issue. If we don't have defence and prosecution lawyers funded properly and a robust community legal assistance sector, in particular, to represent people who can't otherwise afford legal fees, then we are talking about a serious lack of access to justice.

One of the things that I found really disappointing is that, yet again this year, the duty lawyer service run by the Tasmanian Legal Aid Commission or Tasmania Legal Aid, is yet again being funded through the Solicitor's Guarantee Fund. That fund is not intended to fund core services of any kind. It's a volatile fund that sometimes has money in it and sometimes doesn't have money in it. Yes, it should be used for worthy projects in the justice system, but it shouldn't be used to fund core services. I would say a duty lawyer service operating out of the Magistrates Court, which is catching people before they fall through the cracks, making sure that people have representation who otherwise would be appearing in court unrepresented, is a really vital service. It needs to be funded securely through core funding and not through this year-on-year, unstable source of funds, such as the Solicitor's Guarantee Fund. 

Philosophically you might not think that those people deserve representation, but the fact is, it costs your government money when people aren't represented. It takes time out of the court. It means people have their matters adjourned and they come back again and again. It wastes the time of the court and it wastes the time of everyone involved, including victims of crime who might be there expecting a case to be heard and it gets adjourned yet again, through a lack of representation. If Legal Aid is not funded to be able to provide that vital representation to Tasmanians, well then, you're going to continue to see delays in your court system.

I also asked the government about the High Court case of DP vs Bird, which people might have read about. It's a High Court case which was about a victim/survivor of child sex abuse. He was a victim/survivor who was abused in the Catholic Church. To most lawyers' surprise, the High Court rejected the extension of vicarious liability to religious institutions for historical child sex abuse committed by clergy. Priests employed by a church who sexually abuse children are not considered liable because they're not considered to be employees of the church.

Well, that flies in the face of the commission of inquiry, of the Royal Commission into Institutional Circumstances of Child Sex Abuse, and of all of the work that is happening around mandatory reporting, around Working with Vulnerable People Cards, around systems that we are trying to make sure are in place to keep young people safe. This High Court decision flies in the face of that work, and it flies in the face of logic. To think that because a priest is in, what the court said, a relationship akin to employment - they're not actually an employee - they are therefore not liable for child sexual abuse.

It's grotesque to think that people could be getting away with sexually abusing children because they are in a powerful, privileged position of being a priest in a church. That's a decision that the High Court made, but states have a responsibility now to rectify our legislation, because state governments can legislate to extend that liability to people who are in a relationship that the High Court described as 'akin to employment'. States can fix this problem, this grotesque loophole that priests and other religious people working in religious organisations might have if they're not directly employed.

The commission of inquiry gave 191 recommendations, including what happens with volunteers in organisations and the liability that volunteers have to keep children safe, and the reporting requirements that are imposed on everyone, if they see someone working for or volunteering for an organisation doing the wrong thing. Yet here we have a really stark example of religious institutions, some of the worst offenders, being allowed to get off scot-free.

I did hope that I would hear from the Attorney-General that he had plans for legislation to deal with this early next year. He did say that it's been on the agenda of the national meeting of the Standing Council of Attorneys-General but, unfortunately, he's waiting for a national approach. This doesn't need a national approach. Lots of things do, and I agree things should be nationally consistent, but that's not a reason for us not to act first. I believe we absolutely have a responsibility to do that, particularly in the light of the incredible amount of work that went on in the commission of inquiry over recent years.

Also on Justice, I asked the Attorney-General for a timeline on a bill to ban conversion practices in this state. There was a draft bill released by the Premier some time ago, which got pretty negative feedback from the LGBTIQA+ community. Unfortunately, it might have had the counterintuitive effect of making it more possible for conversion practices to be inflicted on people in this state. For anyone who doesn't know what they are, they are a dangerous, cruel pseudoscience inflicted by sometimes religious-based organisations and sometimes not. Sometimes they're kind of veiled in scripture and theology. Basically, they are 'pray away the gay' type programs and they are deeply damaging. They inflict lifelong harm to people who are subjected to them. The legislation that was released for consultation didn't actually do enough to make sure that they would be banned here. In fact, they could have, like I said, the unintended effect of making it easier for people to conduct them here. 

Meanwhile, other states are acting on this. Meanwhile, other states are moving to ban conversion practices, and if we don't act quickly, we will be the last jurisdiction where it's not banned. This will, in some ways, make us a safe haven, which is an awful word to use, because these practices are anything but safe. I wanted a time frame from the minister on when he's going to ban conversion practices in Tasmania and recognise the harm that they cause.

I was really shocked to hear from the minister that he doesn't think they happen here - and they do. They do. He said he's looking at the information that he's been given on the draft bill, but he 'hasn't received any advice that harmful conversion practices are currently occurring in Tasmania.' That's a quote from Estimates. They do happen here, and I told him that. I asked him will he meet with advocates. We've had advocates come and sit in this parliament and offer to meet with Tasmanian parliamentarians. I urge the Attorney-General to do that, to listen to Tasmanians who have been victims of conversion practices, historic and recent. They are still happening now and if we don't act quickly to ban them, Tasmanians are at great risk.

Perhaps one of the biggest bombshells that we had revealed at the Attorney-General's Estimates was his plan to abandon and disband the Tasmanian Industrial Commission. That's an organisation that has been around for an extremely long time and is the arbiter of workplace disputes here for public sector employees. The Industrial Commission are seen as a cornerstone of justice for Tasmanian workers. They have specialised industrial experience and expertise that is pinpointed at being able to deal with public sector workplace matters and we are at great risk actually as a state of losing that really significant expertise if the minister pushes ahead with his plan to disband the Tasmanian Industrial Commission and move it into TASCAT. That's not a reflection on TASCAT. They have a very important role and we have supported their work, but they are also an organisation struggling with under-resourcing and we are already hearing, even in their early days of operation, that they don't have the resourcing needed to make the administrative decisions that Tasmanians expect of them and need of them.

This is a little different. This is a little different to the other jurisdictions that have been moved into the TASCAT. The Industrial Commission has a specific and very important role to protect the rights of Tasmanian workers. At a federal level, the same responsibilities have not been moved into the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. They sit with the Fair Work Commission, as they should. It is deeply worrying that the minister has the plan to disband the Industrial Commission and there wasn't a guarantee given at the table that those commissioner roles will be moved across. So, there is a risk that we're going to lose that specialised expertise in the TIC. There is a risk to Tasmanian workers, that we will lose that expertise and that very important role that the TIC plays in being the arbiter of workplace disputes in this state.

He said that the roles and functions would be moved. That's not the same as moving those commissioner positions across and there is a massive risk with that move. I want to reiterate the fact that at a federal level, that work is conducted by the Fair Work Commission as it should be. It hasn't been moved into a super tribunal and there is a strong argument for the TIC remaining as it is in the Tasmanian system as well. The fact is, that while the minister showed us that there was a downgrading in funding in the TIC that indicated its move across to TASCAT, most public sector unions found out about it at the Estimates table when they were listening to that output. Most unions found out about it that way, which is an appalling way to operate.

We heard from the minister that he intends to consult with public sector unions, but we already heard that a whole heap of work has already gone into this work. The minister said, and I quote, 'There is a lot of work that has gone into this already. There will need to be more work done. There will be a lot of consultation with the relevant state service unions, for example, they are stakeholders.' They are more than stakeholders. There's already a lot of work that's gone into this and they haven't even contacted the unions. They got news of this through seeing it at the Estimates table. This government has such a poor record when it comes to consulting on any matter. All they do is sit in their ivory towers and make decisions then broadcast them out and say that's consultation. Well, it isn't.

We certainly heard that very loudly from the ANMF from their branch secretary Emily Shepherd, who explained the important role of the TIC and her shock at the fact that she heard that news. She described it as an announcement in that budget Estimates that the government intends to absorb the TIC into the TASCAT. She said,

It's often only through the TIC that we are able to enforce the needs of appropriate consultation and procedural fairness, otherwise this government would do whatever it wanted, irrespective of the registered awards and agreements offering our members industrial entitlements, conditions and protection.

This was a bombshell dropped at the Estimates table that the minister, Mr Barnett, intends to get rid of the Tasmanian Industrial Commission. It's a massive risk to Tasmanian workers, it's a massive risk to their livelihoods and to the safety of their working conditions and the minister's done no consultation on it. He said a lot of work has already happened and he has a plan in the future to maybe consult with unions as stakeholders. That's not good enough.

I will also speak a little bit about the Health portfolio. I'm not the shadow minister for Health anymore, but I attended the Health Estimates with my colleague Anita Dow, on behalf of our colleague Sarah Lovell, who's the shadow Health minister.

In case I run out of time, I want to start on a positive in this portfolio, which is that I noted that the minister and I were co-hosting a panel. That happened just yesterday in the Tasmanian parliament. The context of it is that Hobart had the honour of hosting a really important national conference last week. It's the conference of AusPATH, which is the Australian organisation for professionals providing gender-affirming care to trans and gender diverse people. There is a lot of hate thrown at trans people in this state, I find it every time I post anything about the rights of trans people online; I face a wall of abuse on my Facebook page that takes hours to moderate. But I don't mind that, because it's nothing compared to the abuse that trans people experience in their day-to-day lives when they're just trying to get on and live their lives.

It was great that Tasmania could host that conference and they had dozens of Tasmanian health professionals come and attend that conference, who wouldn't otherwise have been able to go and learn so much from other practitioners working in that field. I really want to commend Equality Tasmania for putting together the forum that was co-hosted by myself and the minister for Health, Bridget Archer. They brought together four incredible speakers, Eloise Brook who's the CEO of AusPATH; Yalei Wilson, who's a clinical psychologist; Dr Miro Rainsford who's a counsellor and behavioural sciences researcher; and Amilie Courtney and her parents.

Amilie is a young trans girl who lives in Launceston, who has spoken with such strength and such integrity and such warmth about her experience of seeking and finding gender-affirming care. She's spoken in the federal parliament, she's spoken to Local Government Association and yesterday she spoke here, in the Tasmanian parliament. It was an absolute honour to meet her and to hear her story and her journey, but also, so importantly to hear from her parents, her amazing supportive parents and to recognise that not every trans or gender diverse person has that kind of loving support that Amilie has. In particular, I want to commend her - all four speakers were incredible, we learned so much at that forum about the importance of evidence-based gender-affirming care and that it absolutely saves lives. It absolutely saves lives and makes a huge difference to people who just need healthcare.

I mentioned that forum because it is relevant to some of those questions that we asked in Estimates about LGBTIQA+ health and I want to really commend the minister for her department's involvement in that conference, and I believe the minister spoke at the conference herself. That's such an important show of support and strength from a government that cares about the rights of trans people.

Importantly, we also had Rodney Croome, who's well known to people in this Chamber, come and speak about the launch of a new parliamentary friendship group. It's probably had the most sponsors of any parliamentary friendship group, which is a really lovely thing because it shows just what warmth and support there is across this parliament, both Chambers, all parties and independents, in supporting the rights of LGBTIQA+ Tasmanians. Those parliamentary friendship groups to me, are much more important than a symbolic support vehicle, they are much more important than that. Parliamentary friendship groups offer an opportunity for us to work across the parliament, across party divides in the interests of Tasmanian people, and that's certainly what Rodney focused on in his speech launching the parliamentary friendship group. It's co-hosted by the minister, Mrs Archer, myself as the Labor member for Clark and shadow minister for Equality; Kristie Johnston, the independent member for Clark; Cassy O'Connor, the Greens member for Hobart; Dr Rosalie Woodruff, the Leader of the Tasmanian Greens; and Meg Webb, the independent member for Nelson. There were many more than us, almost half of the lower House in terms of numbers were there yesterday at that forum. The former minister, Mr Jaensch, was there. Many members of the upper House were there as well and everybody who was there learnt so much. The community members I've spoken to since were incredibly heartened by how welcomed they felt in the Tasmanian parliament and that they saw that their rights were front of mind for people of Liberal, Labor, Greens and Independents, upper House, lower House, across the board, and that's a really beautiful thing.

I have gone longer than I intended to, which I always seem to do and there's a whole lot that I didn't speak about that I did raise in the Estimates, which is really important and I will try to return to it in another form of the House, but I want to finish with two short things. 

First of all, a sincere thanks to all of the staff involved with Estimates. It's a long few weeks, budget week followed by budget reply week, followed by two weeks of Estimates, and now here we are for the report back week. It's really important work that we do, that we scrutinise the Budget, but a whole lot of work goes in far above and beyond the 35 of us who have the privilege of serving our communities in this place and I want to in particular thank all of the parliamentary staff, the clerks, the attendants, the Hansard staff, and the catering staff who were here at all hours making sure that we were fed and watered throughout Estimates and, of course, all of the people who work for the various members of parliament as well. I know how much work and preparation goes into those budget hearings and then they're over in a blink of an eye. I know that there's always a lot more that we, as crossbenchers and opposition members, wish to raise, so thank you to everybody involved with that very significant work.

Finally, I just wanted to make a comment that is relevant to both of the portfolios that I sat in for Estimates and that is funding of not-for-profit organisations. The government has for 11 years now been promising longer-term funding agreements, outcomes-based purchasing indexation and more surety of funding for community organisations. Yet year on year we are seeing the pressure on those organisations get higher and higher and their resourcing go lower and lower because it isn't keeping up with inflation. Community organisations are being asked to do more with less because not only is their core funding at risk, and not only is their core funding not keeping up with the cost of providing services, the demand on their services is also increasing. We've seen that particularly through COVID and since COVID, that people who have never needed to rely on community services before are doing so for the first time in their lives.

We heard throughout the election campaign and in the lead up to this Budget and the last Budget, the pain that is being felt by the community services organisations out there providing grassroots support to people who need it most and how hard it is for them to be able to keep up with that increasing demand. They're doing more with less. They are eventually going to have to cut services or cut staff, or both. It was a real shock that in the lead-up to next year's Budget and in the context of this year's Budget, organisations were asked to find their own ways of cutting funding, and I want to read some of it into the Hansard. Community organisations who are coming to government every day and saying we can't do what you're asking of us, it's getting too hard, were asked these questions:

	Which programs or projects could be refocused to deliver core outcomes with more streamlined resources and a refined focus?
	
	Are there initiatives that could be reconsidered, helping balance the budget now without losing sight of long-term goals?
	
	3.	Are there programs or services that could be transitioned out as the needs of Tasmanians evolve and priorities shift?

The needs of Tasmanians are evolving because they're getting worse. The cost of living is higher, the cost of housing, the cost of food, the cost of utilities is higher. People are struggling. Families with two full-time incomes are struggling to make the rent, and yet this government is outsourcing their responsibility to do the right thing and adequately fund those organisations by asking them to find their own savings. Asking them how they can transition services out, how they cannot lose sight of long-term funding goals while finding savings today.

I was appalled when I saw that that's the way that this government is approaching community organisations because they might as well have just said to them, 'Hey, community sector, how can we get blood out of a stone?' Because that's what they're actually asking of these organisations that, don't forget, are providing services on behalf of government. They're not luxury services, they're not 'nice to haves', they are core social services that are being funded by the government to Tasmanians in need. 

If it wasn't clear to anybody yet that this government doesn't actually think about those people, doesn't actually really care very much about those people who are in great need of those services that they fund, well then this upcoming budget priority statement template is the evidence of that. If we needed any more evidence that this government doesn't really care about struggling Tasmanians, this is it. This is what this shows us. On that note, I'll conclude my comments.

[6.11 p.m.]
Mr Di FALCO - Chair, I rise to give the House a recap of the recent budget Estimates process and to outline the issues that stood out across the portfolios I examined. Estimates is not only an administrative exercise, it is our opportunity to drill down into detail, hold agencies to account and bring to this House an honest picture of where things stand.

Over the past week I asked questions across health, primary industries, energy, infrastructure, tourism, racing and state-owned companies. The sessions were long and I thank the standing members for their commitment. They gave us a clear view of the challenges and opportunities facing Tasmania.

One of the strongest themes that emerged was the pressure on our regional industries. I questioned the Minister for Resources on Sustainable Timber Tasmania land that has been tied up in uncertainty. Communities want clarity about future use and they want security for jobs. Ministerial leadership matters when whole towns rely on forestry, agriculture and land access.

I also raised issues around the forestry announcement made by federal government and the risk to jobs in regional Tasmania if Canberra overlooks our industry. Lyons alone carries a significant share of forestry activity, and families in those communities deserve certainty.

I prioritised speaking with Minister for Police on the delays facing firearms services. These delays are preventing farmers, land owners from protecting their crops and delaying talented sport shooters from competing. Safety is the priority, but unnecessary red tape and processing times are unacceptable.

I also spoke directly to the police about the need for infringement notices for minor offences. This brings undue stress on community as well as backlogs to court proceedings. I've been a strong advocate for expanding deer hunting access, however, I focused my questions on the Minister for Primary Industries on inland fishery funding. This department has been underfunded for a decade and is in dire need of additional funding. I will be strongly advocating for support in the May budget. 

In housing, the message remains stark. Demand is rising faster than the system can keep up. I focused my questions on the experiences of women with young children who cannot find stable accommodation, as well as older Tasmanians who are at risk of slipping into homelessness because of rising rents and unsuitable housing. The budget includes initiatives but Estimates reveal the scale of the backlog and delays in new supply. 

I asked how the government plans to clear bottlenecks in planning and land release, whether the agency is working close enough with non-government organisation and local councils.

Energy was another area of significant scrutiny. I questioned the Minister for Energy on their long-term strategies regarding TasNetworks. I raised concerns that many land owners along transmission corridors feel they are not being listened to. Transmission upgrades are necessary for future reliability, but they must be done in a way that respects property rights and communicates honestly with affected people.

Community and hospitality are also important areas. I questioned the minister on her responsibility to support Tasmania's visitor economy. I asked whether they were prioritising insurance and payroll tax as they are a significant cost to small businesses. 

Tourism operators rely on predictable travel options for booking regional dispersal and seasonal planning. With Tourism Tasmania I sought clarity on the strategy to attract high-value visitors, strengthen regional tourism and support small operators. Tourism remains one of the biggest economic drivers in our state and it must remain a priority, both marketing and infrastructure. In infrastructure and transport, I pressed the minister on future infrastructure projects that will bring economic development. If the stadium does not go ahead, the focus will be on roads and bridges. People do not come to our state for roads and bridges. We must invest in projects that enable economic activity.

During Estimates with the Health minister, I highlighted the ongoing pressure in emergency departments and the strain on staff. I raised concerns about long patient wait times, bed block, and the lack of available home care. I asked whether regional health services were being supported adequately, as the gap between regional and metro is widening. Health spending is one of the largest components of the Budget and Tasmanians expect improved outcomes for the amount being invested.

Racing also formed part of my focus. I asked the minister about the sustainability of the industry and the role it plays in regional communities. Hundreds of small businesses rely on racing to remain viable, from trainers, breeders to hospitality and transport. I will speak more about the greyhound ban during the debate. However, I made it clear I do not support this ban. My questions centred on transparency, accountability, and ensuring that the significant government contribution is delivering real benefits for participants and the broader economy.

The most consistent theme across all sessions was the need for long-term economic planning. Over and over again it became clear that Tasmania must grow its economic base if we expect to fund better hospitals, better roads, more housing, and stronger services. Estimates have reminded us that we cannot simply shift money from one department to another and assume the problem is solved. We must grow the overall size of the economy, or we will continue to struggle with rising demand and limited revenue.

While I raised concerns, I also acknowledged the positive outcomes - areas where agencies demonstrated real commitment to improvement. Many public servants are working very hard in difficult circumstances, and I thank them for their professionalism throughout the process. My criticism is never directed at staff; it is directed at systems and decisions that require improvement. As a member of this House, my responsibility is to make sure that taxpayers receive value for money and that the choices made in the budgets reflect the real priorities of Tasmanians. Estimates helped illuminate what is working and what is not. It clarifies the problems we must confront in housing, health, regional industry, energy, and infrastructure. It reinforces that tough decisions are ahead, and a growing economy is not optional - it is essential.

I thank the ministers and all agencies for their engagement. Budget estimates are demanding but vital for transparency. I stand here today more informed and more motivated to continue advocating for practical solutions that support regional Tasmania, strengthen our industries, and deliver better outcomes for families across the state. Thank you.

[6.20 p.m.]
Mr ELLIS - Deputy Chair, I swear I got the jump last time, but Mr Di Falco is quick. I am pleased to appear before Estimates Committee A in relation to my portfolios, Police, Fire and Emergency Management; Business, Industry and Resources and Skills and Jobs. I'm grateful to have been given the responsibility for each of them, and in each there's much work that has already been achieved. I look forward to continuing to deliver for Tasmanians in each of these portfolios. 

Firstly, I want to acknowledge all the hard work that goes into making Estimates possible, including from parliamentary support staff, departmental officers and ministerial office staff. These processes are important for government accountability and transparency, as Mr Di Falco has quite rightly just noted now, and that's reflected in the quality, quantity and volume of work that goes into supporting them.

Police, fire and emergency management is a critical portfolio that touches on almost every aspect of our community. I'd like to again put on the record my thanks for our amazing emergency responders. They go to work every day and volunteer in our communities without knowing what they're going to face, all to ensure that every one of us is safe. 

Our emergency services volunteers are almost 5000 across the state; another point of pride that I gladly spoke about at Estimates. Our volunteers are at the heart of community safety during floods, storms and bushfires. 

We're continuing to invest in new infrastructure, equipment and protective gear through an additional $2.5 million to the volunteer infrastructure investment fund. When disaster strikes, Tasmanians know the SES and TFS will be there, and this government is ensuring that those volunteers have what they need to keep the rest of us safe. 

Many of our first responders will be on duty and on call over the Christmas period and summer holidays. I want to acknowledge that they will be working to keep our families in our communities safe so that we can all have time off with our loved ones. We're very grateful.

At Estimates I spoke about the $3.7 million in funding that the government is providing for the police protective equipment and safety enhancement package. This initiative will provide funding for the multi-use integrated protection vest replacement project, which are a mandatory part of the Tasmanian Police uniform and provide officers with protection from firearms and dangerous weapons such as knives while maintaining a visible presence. It will also fund the permanent roll-out of handheld metal detector wands which will improve police officer safety when searching for metallic objects and dangerous implements such as knives in accordance with Reid's Law which was passed in May. Additionally, the package will fund a Taser trial for frontline policing and bring Tasmania in line with other jurisdictions in Australia.

We're delivering a police force at record strength, with 334 more officers on the frontline since 2014. That increased capability is exactly why Tasmania Police is detecting more crime and intervening earlier when harm threatens our communities. Last week we did hear some dramatic claims from the opposition about firearms crime. The reality is that when we have more police officers and stronger powers to uncover and disrupt criminal activity that previously went unseen, that's what our community expects, and that's exactly what our government's delivering.

On illegal and reckless driving, Tasmanians want to take strong action. I was pleased to speak at Estimates about our strong new laws that will crack down on hooning by implementing tougher penalties and creating the new offense of road rage. What last week did prove was that Tasmanians don't care about the grubby politics; what they care about is our government delivering for community safety, and that's exactly what we're doing, with record police numbers, increased powers and the tools that police need to keep our communities safe. That's our government's record and we stand by it.

Tasmania is one of the safest places to live and raise a family and that's why our government wants to ensure that we keep it that way, which is why we're continuing to back in our police and our emergency services. I was pleased to be appointed to the business, industry and resources portfolio this year, having the opportunity to again pick up resources and working with industry and employers right across Tasmania. At Estimates, I was pleased to outline the continued strength of Tasmania's economy and the work our government is doing to back in business confidence, secure investment and support regional jobs. The office of the Coordinator-General remains a major driver of new economic activity, facilitating $431 million in new investment last financial year and more than $5.3 billion since 2015, with a pipeline worth over $21 billion, in that, delivering real projects, real confidence and real jobs for Tasmanians. 

I also spoke about the strength of our advanced manufacturing sector which continues to win national and global work and demonstrate the on-island capability that we have here in Tasmania.

Through the Advanced Manufacturing Action Plan and Defence Tasmania, we're supporting local companies to secure new opportunities across defence and maritime supply chains, areas of genuine future growth for Tasmania. We discussed the government's commitment to standing with regional communities when major employers face challenges, whether it's the Bell Bay response team providing certainty through a period of transition or the support provided to King Island Dairy and Group 6 Metals, our government steps up when our jobs and communities are at stake and does the hard work needed to secure outcomes.

On resources, I was pleased to highlight that Tasmania recorded the second highest level of mining royalties on record in 2024-25, with around $71 million in royalties and a further $2.2 million in fees and rentals paid. These revenues directly fund essential services for all Tasmanians, demonstrating the importance of maintaining a strong and responsible mining sector.

I also outlined the new bolstering Rehabilitation Trust initiative, which provides an additional $100,000 per year for two years to expand Mineral Resources Tasmania's work in rehabilitating abandoned mine sites, responding to rising costs and community expectations about legacy mining areas. This commitment complements the existing $150,000 per year program and ensures contemporary mining continues to meet high environmental and rehabilitation standards. 

I also advised the committee of the progress we're making in supporting our renewable and sustainable forestry sector, which is worth over $1.2 billion to our economy annually, a progress and process that's put at risk by federal Labor's late night deal with the Greens and we'll have more to say on that soon.

Our timber workers deserve support, not to have their jobs and livelihoods put at risk through policy changes that they haven't been consulted on and have been roundly welcomed by extremist groups, hostile to forestry.

I was pleased to speak about the skills and jobs portfolio where we're supporting thousands of Tasmanians to get the training that they need to build their careers. We're getting on with it as a government, building a better training system that puts the learner at the centre and delivers real outcomes for Tasmania. Tasmania's economy is strong and growing. We've seen record job creation and investment, which means opportunities for Tasmanians. We're working together with community and training organisations to support more Tasmanians into training and employment pathways.

Our regional jobs hubs are making a real difference by connecting people with local employers and training. They're tailored to community needs and helping thousands of Tasmanians find meaningful work. Through the highly successful High Vis Army initiative, we're working together with the building and construction sector to deliver the next generation of tradies. There's a $6 million commitment to extend the High Vis Army to 2027 and to include sparkies and plumbers in this effort.

Our government's committed to building a skilled workforce to grow our tourism and hospitality sector that will support our visitor economy and TasTAFE School for the Visitor Economy will transform how we train future generations of tourism and hospitality workers. The school replaces the previous Drysdale brand and incorporates programs in tourism, guiding, hospitality, cookery, bakery, butchery, events and the Tasmanian Academy for Leadership in Sport and one of the things I will say about the recent discussion on the stadium that has become very apparent to people, is the huge opportunities that this can help deliver for our young Tasmanians. 

Meeting some of the Tasmanian Academy for Leadership and Sport learners, many of whom graduated over the last couple of weeks has been really inspiring. Young people that have created a career for themselves. We have an enormously high completion rate, tracking up around 90 per cent and over half of them already had jobs before the course was finished. Mr O'Byrne spoke with one of the classes that we have in the Academy for Leadership and Sport on the same day that I did. They were suitably inspired by Mr O'Byrne, not necessarily by his footy career, but certainly his conviction or his support for Collingwood. But none of us are perfect, I suppose.

Certainly, the conviction that many members of this place have for this important project because those young Tasmanians have a future because of what the stadium is unlocking. The Devils are a core partner for the Tasmanian Academy of Leadership in Sport which is delivered with TAFE. The Devils, the JackJumpers, netball and cricket but without the Devils this wouldn't have happened. Obviously, there are important votes that will be taking place over the course of this week, but just note that when one of our Academy of Leadership and Sports participants, I should say 'graduates' now, appeared before the upper House committee, I believe it's a great reminder that whether you are someone who's going to take the field or like the rest of us can only dream of that but want to be involved in sport, there are so many opportunities that that this project will unlock.

As mentioned, the School for the Visitor Economy will equip learners with the skills they need to thrive in tourism and hospitality, supporting one of the state's most important industries. The school operates across campuses statewide, ensuring access to world-class training wherever Tasmanians live.

By investing in training, transport and community-led programs, we're ensuring every Tasmanian has a chance to participate and to succeed.

[6.31 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE - Chair, I rise to speak tonight on the budget Estimates process and acknowledge that increasingly over the years, I feel quite frustrated with how we conduct our Estimates committees. I believe they reflect a time where it's a bit more of a 'gotcha' moment really. When you look at the Budget and the amount of work that the public service does to provide information and supporting documentation for the ministers to go through Estimates, we probably covered 2 per cent of the entire budget expenditure. At times, I believe the budget committees and how they're structured are all concertinaed into this one moment where the politics of the day usually overtakes. I will just say that as a comment. I have some views about how we can reform our Estimates processes, not only for government departments, but also for government business enterprises and state-owned companies - more along the lines of the federal Senate in terms of standing committees and the ability for parliamentarians to seek information and provide and ask questions of senior bureaucrats on various expenditure levels. I believe there's a better way we can do it, but we are where we are.

In terms of the year that we've had - the early election, the budget that was blocked, and the budget as an interim budget - I believe there was a different flavour to the Estimates hearings this year. In some respects it's the entree for next year, obviously a full budget and some significant decisions and the work of the multi-partisan committee that I am quite willingly involving myself with and engaging with. I believe it's a very worthwhile process. It doesn't necessarily cosign any member of parliament to a position or to an outcome, but it does provide a forum where particularly the crossbench is able to ask questions and seek greater information from Treasury and from senior department people, arguably, which reflects on the observation I made about the structure of Tasmanian budget Estimates.

Anyway, to the committees themselves, I believe there were two - obviously the two committees that I presented and, unfortunately, I was unwell on day one of the Estimates. I hate missing parliament and the responsibility that I have as a representative to give my community voice, and I missed out on day one. On day three I was in bed with a with a virus and I didn't want to infect people, so I came into the House the next day. 

Committee A was where I focused a fair bit of my work seeking information on the Macquarie Point Urban Renewal project through the minister and talked about the construction around Mac Point. I thought there was quite a good debate, discussion and information provided by the minister. I sought a couple of clarities. There's a number of misnomers or fallacies floating around the Macquarie Point Stadium and it was a good opportunity for me to ask questions directly of the minister, the Department of State Growth and also the representative of the Macquarie Point Development Corporation, Ms Anne Beach, who provided significant information and was very detailed in her response and very calm. For the record, she's done an amazing job in pulling what is a massive project together. Her ability to respond calmly and openly to all the various questions that not only the members of the public but the members of parliament ask her I found quite valuable.

In the session with Housing and Planning and Homes Tasmania, I was very frustrated with that exchange with Homes Tasmania, and their inability to justify, particularly the delay around the planning at Huntingfield and the development project, that apparently that fast-track housing development project, which not one block nor one house has been constructed or been put for sale. For some reason they are forcing builders to go into a panel system, which I think is a good idea for Homes Tasmania, but they are not using the panel system for Huntingfield - and a number of builders have asked, 'Why have you enforced that cost on us?' - and then essentially opened it up to the market. 

There were a number of frustrations around the civil construction contract that was put out for tender, then it was withdrawn. It became pretty clear that they were told to withdraw the tender because they'd made serious mistakes with it. It was a litany of mistakes. What really frustrated me was the lack of contrition from Homes Tasmania about the role they have played to make this development harder and to make the commitment to the community around building, taking access and using that space not being delivered. I was really frustrated by that exchange with Homes Tasmania.

It was a good session with the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. We talked about the common ticketing. That's been a wonderful project. That's gone extraordinarily well, hasn't it really? It's gone from $7 million in 2018, now to potentially $65 million, and is still yet to be delivered. They're doing some trialling, and there's significant questions around whether the Cubic common ticketing system will ever be delivered in Tasmania, given their difficulties in Queensland. Again, another good opportunity to raise the issues I feel strongly about, particularly for the people that I represent in Franklin, around public transport and Metro Tasmania.

In terms of other matters before the committee, one of the biggest things that I was really quite surprised about was in Committee B, talking to the Minister for Justice, Corrections and Rehabilitation where the bombshell was dropped around the Tasmanian Industrial Commission. The significance of the decision of the minister to essentially announce that they were going to roll the Tasmanian Industrial Commission into TASCAT didn't seem to be acknowledged by the minister. I am quite concerned about that. The Tasmanian Industrial Commission or industrial tribunals are a specific and very important part of the resolution of serious workplace issues, either for individuals, for classes of employees or indeed, for whole industries and sectors. All public servants are under the jurisdiction of the Tasmanian Industrial Commission. You have thousands and thousands of Tasmanians who would potentially need to get access to the Tasmanian Industrial Commission.

I raised a question the week before the Estimates regarding the performance of the current Industrial Commission where there were significant delays in making decisions. That was a critique of the performance. It was not a critique or a criticism of the structure. It's very important that people understand the history of industrial commissions - they are lay tribunals. The role of the commissioners in the first place is to conciliate. There's a long history of this in this country in state and federal jurisdictions where the first job is in the lay tribunal and industrial tribunal, how can you resolve the matter without putting the worker through cost and without putting the employer, or the state in this case [Bookmark: Phr2_O=14.6_D=15.2_C=0.83] , through significant litigation and cost. It's a lay tribunal with the emphasis on conciliation. 

In my former role in the trade union movement, I represented workers and industries [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.0_D=25.8_C=0.88]  over many occasions. I would say 90 per cent of the resolutions back when I was representing working people, were done by conciliation and agreement. It's where the commissioner plays a role to get the parties together, mindful of industrial law, but focused more on resolution as opposed to [Bookmark: Phr4_O=56.6_D=2.4_C=0.87]  a very legalistic, expensive litigation process.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=60.0_D=28.8_C=0.84] I'm not necessarily against the functions of an industrial commission to be incorporated more broadly into TASCAT, but what I am against is the lack of a clear pathway for working people that are under the jurisdiction of the Tasmanian Industrial Commission to seek conciliation and arbitration. My fear is that rolled into a broader tribunal it will delay justice [Bookmark: Phr6_O=89.1_D=29.6_C=0.79]  and, as we know, justice delayed is justice denied. The point of my question is that I'm concerned about the delay in the decision making of the Tasmanian Industrial Commission. 

It seems to me that, over the last decade, there's been an over reliance on a very black and white law legal approach to workplace relations. That approach never works. It's expensive for workers, it's expensive for employers [Bookmark: Phr7_O=119.0_D=17.2_C=0.83]  and it rarely results in harmonious workplaces. You might win a legal battle, but you lose the battle of the workplace and productivity. Good relations between [Bookmark: Phr8_O=137.9_D=10.8_C=0.89]  management and employees are super important to ensure that there are smooth operations in the various workplaces across Tasmania. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=149.3_D=29.1_C=0.82]  

The fact that he dropped that in the middle, and I didn't expect it, is of great concern to me. I will continue to pursue that. 

I also raised a question around the Derwent Estuary program and future funding commitments for that. I was not comforted by the answers of the minister, apart from the fact that the minister supported the program but was not able to provide enough information for me. We have to understand that the Derwent Estuary program is one of these unique programs where you have [Bookmark: Phr10_O=178.6_D=14.4_C=0.76]  all levels of government coming together. You have industry that has been, historically, terrible polluters. The Derwent Estuary is one of the most polluted waterways in the country. The Derwent Estuary program over 15 to 20 years, maybe even longer [Bookmark: Phr11_O=193.3_D=29.9_C=0.78]  - probably from 2007 or 2008; or maybe even the late 1990s - has worked hard to bring that estuary and the Derwent River back to some form of life. 

It's wonderful that we are now able to regularly get out into the water in the Derwent, and go to the beaches - when there's a heavy rain, maybe don't. The Derwent Estuary program provides the information around some of the some of the [Bookmark: Phr12_O=223.4_D=15.0_C=0.63]  quality -

Mr Jaensch - Why do you go to the beach in the rain?

Mr O'BYRNE - After a big rain event, the river flushes and there's a whole lot of sediment and other things that come into the river. The Derwent Estuary program updates people on the standard and the condition. 

The biggest issue is the heavy metals. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=239.1_D=23.6_C=0.80]  The Derwent Estuary program works together with EZ and Boyer and all the industries up and down the river, working on how do we now - we're not going to be able to rehabilitate the floor of the river, but if we provide sediment after sediment, year after year, to suppress the heavy metals so it doesn't get stirred up and therefore the quality of the water of the river [Bookmark: Phr14_O=263.5_D=4.4_C=0.78]  improves and it's a far better waterway and we're seeing a whole range of [Bookmark: Phr15_O=269.4_D=10.6_C=0.82]  life come back to the river, which is exciting. It's important for this beautiful part of Australia and our state.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=280.7_D=16.2_C=0.81] Again, the funding is important, and it is at risk. 

I raised the issue around the Neighbourhood Houses and the important role they play in our communities. I'm strongly on the record of that in this place.  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=297.1_D=7.8_C=0.82] Again, I'm very nervous about their funding and their future and I'll continue to prosecute that case. I know it's been the content of some time in Question Time today around North Launceston Football Club issue. On the face of it, that does concern me, and I hope that the minister would provide clarity to the parliament. 

I must admit I remember when I first I left high school, and I'd signed with the East Launceston under-19s at York Park. York Park in 1985 looked a lot different from it does now. I remember that East Launceston, which is now amalgamated with City South, was a co-tenant with North Launceston at York Park. I remember getting changed in the old wooden change rooms - there was no club rooms there for East. We were the poorer cousin; there's no doubt about it. I got my gear and we're all running out to training. I run onto York Park and they said, 'No, Dave, we're over here'. We would run around, watch North Launceston with all the beautiful lights, pinging the ball around and we go to Invermay Park where there were two telegraph poles with dirty old lights, and we had a waterlogged ball that we would break our fingers on. We were definitely the poorer cousins. 

North Launceston has had the benefit of that venue for many years. There is no doubt that it's their home where they play. Their change rooms and club rooms have been a source of great pride and revenue for the club as well, which is also very important. I know that Stadiums Tas has only took over York Park, or UTAS Stadium as it's called now - I will always call it York Park - late last year, I think. I'm not aware of the discussions that the council has had with North Launceston about the redevelopment and their future home, but I was always of the understanding that at some stage with the redevelopment, Invermay Park would be their home.

I'm not across the detail and I thought the way the minister characterised the election commitment was not good. I have great concern about how that answer was framed. However, it's not unlike the discussions when I was in government between 2010 and 2014, around the redevelopment of Bellerive Oval, where the Clarence Cricket Club had a home, had club rooms, had a revenue stream and, with the redevelopment of the Ricky Ponting Stand, we now have found their their new home in Kangaroo Bay. In my sort of volunteer role with the Southern Football League, I know the frustration that the Clarence Football Club has with getting access to Bellerive Ninja Stadium because of the nature of the content that is there. The circumstance that North Launceston is facing, they are a victim of circumstance. They've had the benefit for decades of being on one of the premium grounds in Tasmania, but that in of itself does not guarantee that things don't change. 

When you upgrade a ground for high level elite sport, community football clubs and community sporting clubs are impacted. That's just a fact of life. Clarence Cricket Club has worked through it. It was some really hard negotiations and there were some unhappy members I'm sure at various times because of the access they had. They were negotiated through the clubs; they were treated with respect. 

It seems there was a confused answer today in Question Time and I'm concerned about the response and we'll see where that goes, no doubt in the next few days. North Launceston is a proud football club that has had the benefit and the tradition of playing out of York Park. Their history needs to be respected and their future needs to be supported. Hopefully that can be resolved. It was unfortunate the manner in which it was characterised during Question Time, and I think everyone is concerned about that.

In relation to to the Budget overall, clearly the Budget is in a state. The debt is increasing and significant and we all together have a challenge. It seems to be that every time I raise, or a member raises, an issue around the budget, everyone says, 'Oh well, just don't build a stadium', and everything will be fixed. Well, we know that's not right. If you stop a capital project, it will have an impact, but there will still be significant debt. When you look at the credit downgrades, they raise a number of issues in terms of the reasons why Standard and Poor's and Moody's have downgraded our credit rating. They do talk about capital projects, but they also talk about significant Health overruns. You look at the half-a-billion dollars alone in Health overspend, so the recurrent costs and the services. The credit agencies have referred to those. A big part of the reason why I support the stadium, particularly in context of the Budget we face, really goes to the heart of some of the commentary provided by Standard & Poor's and Moody's. One of the big reasons why I believe in the multipurpose Macquarie Point stadium is not just because it delivers an AFL licence - that in itself is important - but all of the economic activity that it will take. 

In my contribution supporting the stadium, I talked about the structure and the nature of the Tasmanian economy and where people, the taxpayers, rely on for their income. Predominantly, we have a very small, private, tradeable part of our Tasmanian economy. In the Moody's update, and part of the justification and rationale for the downgrade, they make reference to this:

The state's moderately diversified but small economic base limits its ability to significantly increase own-source revenue.

What it means by that is that we have a narrow economy. For many, many years - and when I was economic development minister, despite the critique of the then-Premier Mr Hodgman when I came back to parliament, there was a document, and I know others have referred to it, our economic development plan. It was about diversifying the Tasmanian economy and building the private economy in Tasmania. As a part of the downgrading by Moody's, they talk about our narrow economic base. Standard & Poor's refers to it as well. This is Standard & Poor's, part of their justification:

Tasmania is wealthy by international standards, but its economic performance has traditionally lagged the national average due to lower population growth and a less diversified economy than the large mainland states.

They talk about how the net interstate migration has been negative. What that means is investments in enabling infrastructure, like the multipurpose stadium, actually starts to deal with the underpinning weakness of the Tasmanian economy, which builds the capacity for our state to be in a more financially stable position. S&P also makes another really good point:

The institutional framework within which all Australian states and territories operate supports Tasmania's management. We consider this framework to be one of the strongest and most predictable for sub-sovereign governments globally.

It puts our rating in context of the institutions that we rely on - that Australia, the Commonwealth and state governments have relied on for many years. 

Having said the fact that I wasn't going to speak too long, I've probably spoken longer than I -

Dr Woodruff - Shame.

Mr O'BYRNE - That's another 'shame' and that's a very parliamentary term and I accept that. I fall on the sword of shame. I thank all the staff and the Chairs, obviously, sitting for long periods of time listening to the banter to and forth, all the staff of parliament in supporting the Budget process, the Estimates process. It is really important. All the public servants, despite the fact that it's a very political environment, thank you to the public servants and public sector workers that have provided the evidence and the information for us to be able to do our job appropriately. It's, at times, a thankless task, and I personally want to put on the record my thanks to all of those employees in the departments that provided support to their departments and their ministers to enable a level of debate and a question and answer to occur. There ends my contribution.

[6.54 p.m.]
Dr BROAD - Chair, it's a very unusual year, this year. We've had a late Budget, then we've had budget Estimates, then we've had Government Business Enterprise hearings, all sort of rolled into one. Now we're reporting back on the lot. This is fourth or fifth week, and the big question that's in my mind is, is this as good as it gets? I think that's probably the question that the Liberal members should be asking themselves: is this as good as it gets, after 11 years? I think if the Liberal members reflected honestly, they're definitely on the downhill slope, because everything is getting worse. If you look across a whole range of budget issues, the budget is in a far worse state now than 2014 when they came into government. Health is worse, housing is worse, education is worse: Just about everywhere you look, things are worse. Performance of the ministers, I would argue, is also worse. How did we actually get to this point? One of the things that I will be talking about today is the way the standards have been slipping, definitely been slipping, in the years I have been here - eight years now? - I've seen the standards definitely slip, and we have seen it in this budget.

This budget is actually already out-of-date, and it's already out-of-date for a couple of reasons. The first reason is because during this whole budget process, the state has had two credit downgrades. This is just astonishing, really, and as Saul Eslake said, 'It is a vote of no confidence in this government', the Liberal government's budget management. Two credit downgrades, first Moody's and then Standard & Poor's decision to downgrade Tasmania's credit rating, shows that this Liberal government has lost control of the Budget.

What do these credit downgrades mean? These downgrades mean that Tasmania will have higher borrowing costs for years to come, and that will mean that there will be less for every dollar that's spent on interest. It won't create a single job in Tasmania, it won't provide a single hospital bed in Tasmania, it won't build a single home in Tasmania, and it won't keep a single teacher in a classroom in Tasmania. It will simply be money that's heading somewhere else. I just have to remind the Liberal members that when they came into office some 11 years ago, there was no net debt. None. No net debt. Now, Tasmania has just officially become the state with the worst finances in the country. The worst finances in the country, I just have to repeat that. When the Liberals came into government 11 years ago, there was no net debt, and now Tasmania has the worst finances in the country. It has the worst levels of debt, of state sector debt, and also, now, the worst credit ratings. We have a Treasurer and a former treasurer who say that this was actually a great budget. It is just beggars belief.

The debt keeps rising. The debt that we have today, this very moment, is not the problem. The problem is the trajectory of the debt. I have been warning about this for years and so have others, including Saul Eslake, including Treasury, including a lot of other people, that the debt is well and truly out of control. That is the problem. It's not the debt that we owe today, it's where the debt is headed.

Let's just talk about these credit rating agencies. These are global organisations and what they do is they rate various countries and states all around the world. They have their methods and so on, so we can compare against other countries and other places. Moody's said that Tasmania's credit rating, when they downgraded it from a A2 to A3, making it the lowest of all Australian states, they said the decision was due to 'a sharp rise in the state's debt burden and growing interest costs', which it says will be difficult to contain over the next two years. 

As a result, these pressures will increasingly constrain the state's ability to respond to future shocks, reflecting weaker governance strength than we assessed in the past.

You have a global credit ratings agency saying that this state, the Liberal government, reflects weaker governance strength than we have assessed in the past. Weaker governance - that's what a global ratings agency said and rated your government. The credit ratings are used by lenders as an indication of the ability to pay debt and, as a result, we will actually be paying higher interest rates when we go to the market seeking people to hold our debt for us. 

I think the most ridiculous thing about Moody's credit downgrade was the way that Treasurer Eric Abetz described it. The Treasurer said he was 'not alarmed' by the downgrade, and instead he 'welcomed Moody's revising its outlook from negative to stable'. So, they had a higher credit rating with a negative outlook, and now the state has a lower credit rating with a stable outlook, and he's saying, 'Oh, that's great, we've gone from negative to stable.' Well, you've gone down a level. It's so silly. 

For those on the other side who do not understand the reality of this credit downgrade, I'll give you an example. It would be like a manager in the English Premier League being very happy about being safely lowered down into the championship league. That is the equivalent of Eric Abetz's statements. It's just like an English Premier League coach/manager who's been downgraded into the championship league saying, 'Oh, well, at least we're safe in the championship league for now.' That is how ridiculous the Treasurer of Tasmania's statements were around the credit downgrade. Absolutely unbelievable, his comments. Talk about head in the sand.

Then we had Standard & Poor's. After that first credit downgrade, late last week we had another one. Standard & Poors ,when they gave their credit downgrade, they said:

We expect Tasmania's operating accounts to remain in deficit until fiscal year 2027 due to strong growth in operating expenditure in recent years. This will result in much weaker fiscal metrics than for many 'AA+' rated peers globally. 

They know this stuff. They watch it around the globe, and they've said that Tasmania has weaker fiscal metrics and that's why they're downgrading us as a state. In addition, they're saying the state's capital rising capital spending will weigh on overall cash deficits, driving its debt burden structurally higher. What that actually means is, because this state, and this government, are borrowing to pay interest, that will put further pressure on the budget. The classic example would be putting groceries on the credit card. Then, Standard & Poor's went on to say:

We consequently lowered our long-term issuer credit rating on Tasmania to 'AA' from 'AA+'.

Also in this, they give a warning. The credit ratings agencies gave the state a warning when they said that Tasmania was on a negative outlook. That happened a year ago and a year ago before then, where the credit ratings agency said, 'Look, we've now got a negative outlook about you.' The state did nothing, the state kept spending, the Liberals kept spending, the debt's getting worse, so now we've had a downgrade.

There's also a warning in Standard & Poor's credit decision here. They're saying, in the downside scenario, 'we could lower our rating on Tasmania if its operating deficits persist or if its deficits after capital accounts underperform our forecast, driving debt materially higher'. That is a massive warning for this state, because what we know is, this government has lost control of the budget and so they are not going to outperform any forecasts. These are dangerous times for the state and the state budget.

I'll talk now about my portfolios, and one of them is Forestry. We've had a situation where just before GBE Estimates, we had the federal government do a deal and come up with new regulations that will apply to forestry. What the Liberals won't admit, though, is that Premier Jeremy Rockliff, when he was up in Canberra, was in regular contact with environment minister Murray Watt to discuss the new environmental laws, which completely exposes the Premier's political theatrics after the fact. Jeremy Rockliff spent a week privately engaging with the Prime Minister while publicly attacking him for the very same discussions. I think that this is very misleading from the Premier. It's also a bit hypocritical and designed to whip up division rather than deal honestly with Tasmanians, especially around an industry that has long been the political whipping boy, and that is forestry.

Felix Ellis's comments are even more astonishing. I find it outrageous for Felix Ellis to accuse anybody of doing a deal with the Greens as nothing short of farcical. This is the same minister who cut his own deal with the Greens earlier this year by dumping his own forestry policy. This is on top of a government who sold out the greyhound racing industry and the salmon industries now, to do a deal with the Greens and the Independents, to be in government. Now, here they are talking about a Labor-Greens deal when they've done the very thing. 

The minister, Mr Ellis is a bit angry about this. He really is. He is very angry. I think he's actually reflecting his own disappointment that his forestry policy, which he launched in 2024, was thrown out as trade bait, shall we say, for a deal with the Greens. Felix has to try to defend that. We know that Mr Ellis really wants a fight. He loves a fight and he loves to get stuck in. That's what he was trying to do in 2024. He was trying to pick a fight. His policy was to open up these contentious areas, the Future Potential Production Forest areas, during an election campaign. And what did that do? It got the forest industry offside, I can tell you that for a fact. That was because he had no forest industry representatives who would back him up. Instead, in 2024 we literally had the entire forest industry standing behind Labor, because we weren't going to play the politics like Mr Ellis was doing. That policy that he took to the 2024 election was dumped when the Liberals did a deal with the Greens. Oh, the irony.

We know that the industry doesn't support this minister. I know that this minister has been out on Friday trying to whip up a frenzy amongst the forest industry and it hasn't happened. Why hasn't it happened? It's because of this minister, Felix Ellis's own behaviour back in 2024. The industry simply cannot trust him. They know that all he wants is to fight. He doesn't want good outcomes. That's why he continues to mislead about my comments in GBE hearings. When I was trying to get answers about Sustainable Timbers Tasmania, about the plantation sawlog resource that this industry is going to rely on, he deliberately verballed me on numerous occasions.

Here he is, a minister of the Crown, responsible for such an important industry as forestry, who continues to mislead and makes claims that are not backed up by evidence because he is still angry about his own forestry policy getting dumped and about the industry not supporting him. What's he doing? He's taking it out on me and he's refusing to answer questions about the real issue, which is the plantation sawlog response.

We know that a reduction in supply of logs out of the native forest - in the state forests - it will decline. It absolutely will decline. It has been predicted for years, and 2027 is the drop-off date; that is two years away. What is supposed to fill in the gaps for the industry to maintain those jobs in regional areas is the plantation sawlog resource. Felix Ellis as minister refuses to answer questions. Those are the questions that the industry wants answered. They don't want to start a fight like he does.

I also have to reflect on other issues in this Budget, like housing. Now, as I've said, is this as good as it gets? The Liberals should be asking themselves that question because the housing waitlist continues to climb. Every time the figures are updated, they are climbing. What we have now is that the social housing waitlist continues to climb with a record 5380 applicants on the register as of October 2025. Is this as good as it gets? Colleagues, is this as good as it gets? When you look back, what was the housing waitlist when they came into government, it was 2465, way less than half. Over 11 years, your waitlist has doubled. Is this as good as it gets?

If you go back and look at priority back in when the Liberals came into government some 11 years ago, the wait for category one, or the most urgent, was 21 weeks, which is less than six months. What is it now? It's now 86 weeks. That's over one-and-a-half years. You've blown out wait-times for the most urgent category by over a year. Only last month, the month before, it was almost two years. It was just outrageous. 

How can this happen? It's because the government are simply not building enough houses. They're pretending they are, but they're not. I will give you one classic example, there are many. I have in my hand a housing land supply order for Devonport. This became effective in July 2019, and I think Roger Jaensch was the minister who signed this - I can't tell the signature, it's a bit hieroglyphic, but I'm pretty sure Mr Jaensch was minister at the time. This is for 39A North Fenton Street in Devonport, which was the old bowls club site. The bowls club moved out to Spreyton, the land became available, the government acquired it and now it's called Higgs Court.

This Housing Supply Order was supposed to fast track, by doing all the rezoning and the like, as part of the order. This order's intended zone in relation to the application is to be declared in a residential zone referred to in the applicable planning zone, so it's supposed to get things going a little bit quicker. That was 2019, so six years ago. I went out there only just last week - 2019 there are a number of subdivisions, none of them have sold or maybe one has sold - there is one house that has been constructed and it's only very recent. There has been one house constructed on this lot, which was supposed to be 13 or 14 lots, I think from memory, and there's one single house.

What do you have in that place? Ironically, what you have is homeless people having set up camp in this area. Homeless people, and there's one house built. Oh, the irony. Those homeless people should have a roof over their heads and they don't because in six years only one house has been built, and that very recently - they've only just moved in. One house in six years and homeless people camping around the outside, waiting for a house. How long are they waiting? Well, probably getting close to two years.

This is one of the most frustrating things that I get in my political life is those people coming into my office who are just about to be homeless, whose lease has ended - I just had people recently, there's been a cancer diagnosis, there's children with autism, and they're about to lose their rental because the owners are doing renovations. They've been on the housing waitlist for years. Years. And they are scared. They're petrified that in only the end of January, they will be homeless. You have a husband who has a terminal cancer diagnosis, and you have autistic children, and they could be homeless. That just says everything about this government. They're not doing the work. As I said, is this as good as it gets?

Also, there's been standards slipping everywhere for this government. Standards slipping absolutely everywhere. What we saw during this week in the Tasracing hearings should actually outrage people. What we saw was a government business openly campaigning for one side of politics during an election campaign, using taxpayer funds. This is just absolutely outrageous. Also, it is potentially unlawful, it's potentially against the State Service Act and it also potentially breaches the GBE Act, and there has to be an investigation. If the Premier had any standards, he would investigate. In Question Time today he said he didn't know anything about this. Well, he needs to get to the bottom of it, because it is outrageous.

Can you imagine what the Liberals would be doing if a government business enterprise was openly campaigning for the Labor Party by sending text messages promoting a Labor policy to all the people that they had a number for? Promoting a Labor policy, there would be outrage. Where's your outrage, Liberal members? Do you seriously think that Tasracing campaigning for a Liberal government during an election is okay? Tasracing inserted themselves into a live election campaign, pushing a Liberal Party political message, using taxpayer funded infrastructure and staff to do it. They distributed a mass text message and published online material actively promoting the Liberal Party's TasInsure policy. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=6.8_D=8.0_C=0.91]  What they didn't do was promote the Liberal government support for the greyhound industry because we know that one ended up in the bin. It's probably lucky for them, they didn't do that [Bookmark: Phr3_O=16.3_D=15.0_C=0.82] , but I digress.

This is the standard slipping and we also saw the standards are slipping with other ministers, new ministers. The same standard of accountability should apply to minister Nick Duigan when he admitted to withdrawing $100,000 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=31.6_D=6.8_C=0.87]  in funding for the North Launceston Football Club because the president appeared at a Labor media event. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=39.9_D=2.2_C=0.94]  I know that the Liberals are  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=43.4_D=7.0_C=0.81] vindictive, and they have been vindictive for a long time, but now they're saying the quiet stuff out loud. 'You mess with us, and we are going to cut your funding.'

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=51.0_D=8.0_C=0.85] We have a new minister who has come into this place and maybe he doesn't know that that's not on. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=59.4_D=12.4_C=0.80]  Maybe it's because since his time being a minister, the standards had already slipped so far that he thought that this was normal. We know the other ministers are a bit better at hiding this sort of stuff and that's why it was so [Bookmark: Phr9_O=72.5_D=10.1_C=0.78]  out of the blue that he admitted, 'Well, okay, the reason the North Launceston Footy Club's not getting the money is because they stood with Labor.' What an outrage [Bookmark: Phr10_O=83.7_D=14.0_C=0.66] .

Getting back to TasInsure. What a joke. All we had during the election campaign were hats and the Premier with TasInsure on his on his jacket and an empty shopfront. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=98.9_D=25.0_C=0.76]  What we found out this week is the chair of MAIB, which is supposed to fund this TasInsure - it's supposed to leverage the balance sheet, apparently, which is complete garbage. The chair of the Motor Accidents Insurance Board revealed that he asked the minister, Kerry Vincent, whether he had any information on TasInsure because they're the ones who are supposed to be propping up TasInsure, and the minister, Kerry Vincent, admitted he knew nothing. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=125.2_D=1.2_C=0.77]  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=126.7_D=8.2_C=0.81]  The minister was unable to say if the government planned to utilise MAIB's balance sheet to deliver the policy as announced by Jeremy Rockliff during the election.
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=135.2_D=10.7_C=0.87] 
Mr Vincent was also not consulted on the drafting of the legislation, the bill that we just saw dropped into parliament. That's presumably because it appears [Bookmark: Phr15_O=146.6_D=1.3_C=0.80] , unbelievably [Bookmark: Phr16_O=148.4_D=2.8_C=0.85] , that this legislation was drafted using AI. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=152.5_D=20.7_C=0.82]  It's incredible. This is such a joke. You could make a whole TV series about this one, about how this TasInsure thing came about. This comes on top of the Treasurer, whose name is literally on TasInsure piece of legislation, admitting he was not involved whatsoever in drafting it. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=173.8_D=11.9_C=0.66]  There's no business case for TasInsure. There's no modelling for TasInsure. There are just the Premier's hats, jackets, a closed shopfront and legislation drafted by AI. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=186.9_D=9.8_C=0.81]  What a complete joke.

I'd like to reflect on some of the really good work that's happening with the public servants and probably top of that list at the moment is the Auditor-General. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=197.3_D=14.3_C=0.79]  The Auditor-General, Martin Thompson, says his office funding is the lowest levels in Australia, limiting his ability to identify millions in potential government savings. This is a government that needs to identify these savings, right? [Bookmark: Phr21_O=211.8_D=21.0_C=0.85]  The Auditor-General can give them pathways, and has made some recommendations, but the Auditor-General is really struggling and he says, 'It's going to get more difficult over time as our funding level for performance audit activities reduces.' He also said, 'We are faced with making decisions about where we choose to investigate an audit, particularly in our performance audit area.'

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=233.3_D=12.4_C=0.84] That's important, I believe, as the Auditor-General says,

We also think that an increase in funding to the Auditor-General would likely lead to identification of more areas for efficiency and savings [Bookmark: Phr23_O=247.1_D=27.9_C=0.83]  and we are interested in engaging with or indeed have scheduled meetings with the Treasurer, understanding how we can work with areas such as his Efficiency and Productivity Unit, which we've heard very little about.

I would argue more money for the Auditor-General is good spending because an investment in the Auditor-General, an investment in the work that the auditor's office does can deliver savings to a government who should be desperate to find savings. [Bookmark: Phr24_O=276.3_D=9.9_C=0.88]  He also says, 'at the moment the ministers have very little transparency and insight into the financial performance of large of the larger departments.' This is very surprising. [Bookmark: Phr25_O=286.9_D=5.0_C=0.90]  The ministers have very little transparency and insight into the financial performance of the larger departments. [Bookmark: Phr26_O=292.8_D=9.8_C=0.83]  This is just unbelievable, and the Auditor-General says, 'It's difficult for ministers to identify the financial performance and operational performance and efficiency of agencies.' [Bookmark: Phr27_O=303.8_D=1.2_C=0.81]  The auditor can go and find savings. She said:

Another example where performing an audit might prove useful was the Department of Health, where patient admissions had gone up by 19.5 per cent but costs had risen by 42 per cent.

That is the auditor's job, but why wouldn't they fund the Auditor-General? Well, I think there might be a few reasons, and that is some of the reports that the Auditor-General has been putting out. 

Let's talk about potholes. One of the topics that just keeps coming up, every time it rains we get potholes. Now, what is going on with potholes? Why, every time it rains, do we get potholes? Well, the Auditor-General actually put out an audit finding number 52526, 1 December, and he went through and the audit assessed the degree to which State Growth implemented the five recommendations made in the report of the Auditor-General in 2021.

The Auditor did a report in 2021, made recommendations, what's happened? Now, these recommendations, for example, were to implement strategies and actions to reduce maintenance renewal shortfall, including the improvement of the integration quality of information used to prioritise investment in maintenance, what's the status of that? Partially implemented. Integrate road assessment performance, degradation factors and network performance management systems to better use and enhance the quality of information used for decision-making. What happened there? Partially implemented. Link this level of service for customers and technical level of service to performance measures to further improve the approach to performance management. Partially implemented.

What's going on with potholes? Well, the 2020 audit found that despite increased funding, there was a shortfall in maintenance and renewal budget, potentially leading to a deterioration of road conditions into the future, which is exactly what we are seeing: Predicted in 2020, we're seeing it now because the government haven't acted. Well, is this a story we've heard before or what? It's just unbelievable.

As a result, we recommend that State Growth implement strategies and actions to reduce maintenance and renewal shortfall and so on. State Growth advised they were advised about a funding gap and that funding gap, including intervention maintenance renewal not occurring at an optimal point in time, which in turn contributed to the cost to maintain the network doubly between 2022-23 and 2024-25. Here you have an Auditor-General's report, you completely ignore it or you only partially implement it and then five years later you've got another report saying you still haven't done it.

No wonder the roads are struggling, because this is the government that just will not listen. There's also the Coordinator-General. The Coordinator-General reports that he has met his investment facilitation objectives, and that's because they're very loose, you can fit anything into it, and the Auditor-General has been very scathing of the Office of the Coordinator-General, one of Tasmania's highest paid public servants, and then there's also the proposed sale of Wilkinsons Point, which is another scathing review from the Auditor-General.

There was no business case or plan, which meant public service were not always operating within the framework that supported them to operate ethically and transparently. I mean, it's just unbelievable. No wonder you do not want to give the Auditor-General any more money, despite the Auditor-General having the ability to identify savings. Why wouldn't you do it? Because you're worried- when the Auditor-General keeps rolling over these Liberal rocks, he finds slime and scum underneath them, which he has to report on but like we saw when the Auditor-General pointed out that TT-Line, when he did his audit, was insolvent and he repeated that in evidence, given in effect, under oath in the Estimates hearings, he said yes, TT-Line was insolvent but what does the Premier say? That's just an opinion. That is more than just an opinion, that is shameful.

[7.24 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON - Chair, after a week of Estimates, one thing is very clear. The government has taken an overstretched public sector and laid upon it even more complexity, reform and financial pressure, while offering very little honesty about the depth of the challenge we face. The stadium, sat like a shadow over almost every portfolio, whether it was questions about planning, governance, debt servicing or the hundreds of conditions that now need to be met, the message was the same. The government has taken on a multi-billion dollar project at the exact moment the state is least equipped to manage it, and it can do so thanks to Labor, who have unconditionally backed the stadium in without even a whimper of opposition. Labor, who sold out to the Liberals and have now seemed to form an unholy country's first Liberal-Labor coalition, now find themselves in direct conflict with angry rank and file members. These members do not want their MPs to vote for the project.

It has been revealed to me today the prominent Devonport Labor branch voted last week in support of a motion opposing the stadium and they've been muzzled by the head office. It begs the question: how many other branches are also opposed to the stadium and have they also been muzzled? How can Labor's Legislative Council members vote for the stadium? The Devonport branch told me directly:

As a branch, we are not supporting the PLPs and the executive's position on the Macquarie Point Stadium purely on the economics and the commission's report.

Of course, they are referring to the Tasmanian Planning Commission's (TPC) report. Labor's branch members get it. They know how dire our financial position is as a state. They heard all the warning signs given by the TPC and they saw the evidence of that in Estimates.

The Estimates hearings painted a very bleak picture indeed. Departments are already dealing with major reforms, the Youth Justice Blueprint, the commission of inquiry recommendations, the Watt review of the Public Service and the ongoing crises in family violence, health, disability, literacy and education. Every agency is stretched. Workers are reporting burnout and rising workers compensation claims, and in some departments between one third and more than half of all workers' compensation claims are now for psychological injury. That is an unmistakable sign of departments under serious stress and strain, people trying to meet ever-growing demands with shrinking teams, unclear priorities and constant structural upheaval. Morale is fragile, yet they are expected to absorb a project of the scale of the stadium without additional capacity and without clear governance.

Time and time again we heard about worrying signs of issues not being dealt with, problems put off, denial that there was even an issue to face in the face of clear evidence that there was, and a lack of resources or will to do anything about the issues.

I remarked to one of my parliamentary colleagues when we were both trying to self-medicate with a coffee that it felt like we were witnessing multiple fires and the government was just standing by with a barely a thimble of water telling us there was nothing to see here, and all of this is happening in the same week that Tasmania's credit rating was downgraded by both Moody's and Standard & Poors. The Treasurer tried to put a brave face on it, but the rating agency is explicitly pointed to weak budget management, rising debt and unsustainable spending patterns, including election-driven promises and a stadium, as major risks. These warning signs are not political commentary. They are hard external assessments of the state's financial health.

Across the Premier's and Treasury's portfolios we saw the same troubling patterns: no transparency around the mandatory player card report; no commitment to evidence-based gambling harm measures; no assurance that essential programs like 26Ten will continue; unrealistic assumptions about Public Service wages, and a so-called natural attrition strategy that, everyone knows, is neither strategic nor realistic; and the Premier's Wellbeing Framework, an idea that had potential, was revealed to be no more than a communications tool than a driver of budget allocations. That is a profound missed opportunity. If wellbeing is to mean anything, it must shape spending decisions, not sit on a shelf as a glossy publication.

In youth justice, the contradictions were even more stark. Whilst minister Palmer reiterated her commitment to the Youth Justice Blueprint and the commission of inquiry, both of which call for reducing young people's contact with police and the justice system, not expanding it, minister Ellis declared everything is on the table and maintained his call for adult time, adult crime laws. These two positions cannot coexist. You cannot talk about rehabilitation while designing policy around punishment.

When I challenged Minister Ellis to provide any evidence that adult crime, adult time laws actually make our community safer and prevent youth crime, he had the audacity to table a media release from the Premier of Queensland; a finer piece of political puff you could not find. Not evidence. Indeed, there is a plethora of evidence to the contrary that shows that these types of laws actually do more harm, but then again, this government has a serious allergy to evidence and expert advice.

Whilst I'm still discussing youth justice, it would be remiss of me not to mention the revelations about the funding of JCP youth. We heard evidence of deeply inappropriate practices, disturbing conduct and astonishingly, there was no government, no departmental advice to fund the program. No analysis, no scrutiny, no accountability, only young people at risk. Meanwhile, programs that actually work, like the Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Services Bail Support Program, Dress for Success and a range of prevention focused community led services struggle each year for stable funding despite delivering proven results and clear savings to the state. This is the government's Achilles heel. It does not invest enough, or for long enough, in the prevention measures that stop harm before it occurs. Prevention doesn't produce a ribbon cutting moment. It doesn't generate a headline during an election campaign, but prevention is precisely what reduces demand on hospitals, police, prisons, child safety, housing and emergency services. Every dollar saved in acute responses tomorrow starts with prevention today, yet prevention is treated as optional while far more expensive crisis response continues to swallow the budget.

The Auditor-General made it clear that they did not have the resources required to conduct the performance audits Tasmania desperately needs and that transparency barriers, including limited access to cabinet documents, are hampering their work. Investing in proper audit and oversight is not a cost, it's protection against waste, mismanagement, and exactly the sort of government failures we saw around JCP youth.

When it came to revenue, the Treasurer left the door slightly ajar, reluctantly saying he's open to suggestions. That is not leadership. He has the entire Treasury at his disposal. If we are facing cuts to public and community services, then government assistance to industry must also be on the table. The Treasurer agreed with that in principle, but in the next breath ruled out increasing casino taxes, a tax that wouldn't affect vulnerable Tasmanians and only impact on one very large and influential gambling business. Mind you, that would probably jeopardise the next generous political donation to the Liberal Party, so there'll be more chance of pigs flying, I suspect.

However, if the Treasurer was even remotely sincere in putting the private sector under the microscope, I look forward in the next budget for evidence that subsidies and grants to private entities are being wound back unless they deliver a clear, measurable public benefit, because difficult years lie ahead. Cuts are coming. The state's finances are in a dire shape. 

The only way Tasmanians will accept difficult decisions is if the government is honest about the problem, transparent about its evidence and committed to shielding those who will be harmed by cuts. They also need to see the government itself is willing to make sacrifices, not only the public sector, not only frontline workers and not only vulnerable Tasmanians. That's why I'll continue to call for legislative end to pork barrelling. The Auditor-General and the Integrity Commission have recommended it, experts have recommended it, and even ratings agencies point to election driven spending as a budget risk. Ending pork barrelling is one of the clearest ways to restore public trust, improve governance and repair our finances.

Transparency was a repeated theme throughout Estimates, and nowhere is a lack of it more obvious than the government's refusal to release Estimates briefs prepared for ministers. My office sought them through Right to Information over the last week or so, and we've been told departments have prepared too much material and it would take too long to assess our RTI requests. That is simply absurd. In other jurisdictions, these briefs are routinely released, sometimes proactively. If this material was prepared to inform the public record during Estimates, then it should be ready for release now. Anything less is a deliberate barrier to scrutiny. We all saw those folders sitting on the tables. They ought to be released.

Estimates week confirmed what many Tasmanians already feel. A government making high risk commitments without the government capabilities, resources or transparency needed to deliver them, while long-standing crises across literacy, health, education, housing, disability and community safety continue to worsen and absorb an ever growing share of the budget.

The public service is not a problem to be trimmed. It is the backbone of delivering services for future generations. Yet we heard again and again that this is being hollowed out by attrition, stretched by reforms, overwhelmed by demand and now threatened by budget cuts. Cutting people who deliver essential services does not make government more efficient, it makes it less so. It forces remaining staff to juggle multiple roles, creates bottlenecks, slows down service delivery and increases stress, feeding directly into the rising psychological injury claims we are now seeing. An overstretched workforce is not an efficient workforce.

Tasmania can't afford business as usual, and Tasmanians deserve more than optimistic talking points. They deserve honesty, they deserve evidence, they deserve decisions that genuinely serve the public interest, especially the interest of young Tasmanians who will inherit the consequences of what we do now. If we want a healthier, safer, more prosperous state for the next generation, we must invest in prevention, demand transparency and make decisions that strengthen, not weaken, the systems that every Tasmanians rely on. That is a standard the government must meet now, but instead the government has given us a 'vibe'. The pretence of a stadium-led budget recovery, with no evidence, no modelling and a blatant disregard for expert advice.

I spoke in my contribution on the stadium order debate a couple of weeks ago, that I feared that there'd be so many horrible told yourself moments to come if the order passed this parliament. Well, those moments sadly, are already here. Credit rating downgrades have already come to fruition. Significant cost loads are already occurring, a 900 per cent increase in the transportation cost of sand for the concrete, just to name one. An admission that we, the Tasmanian people, are paying for MPDCs borrowings and the borrowings of our equity injections, and programs and capital works unfunded or delayed thanks to the need to pay for a stadium that divides our state. These are really tragic, told-you-so moments that have already come to fruition. It is beyond sad. As I go about my community and Clark, I hear the worry, and I see the impact.

May 2026 is only six months away, but we have been warned. We must act now and do the right thing. Tasmanians are relying upon us.


DIVISIONS 8 and 10 -
Minister for Primary Industries and Water, Minister for Veterans' Affairs

[7.38 p.m.]
Mr PEARCE - Thank you, Chair. It's good to be with you again, isn't it?

CHAIR - Always a pleasure.

Mr PEARCE - I rise today to reflect on the Estimates proceedings, where I was pleased to provide a comprehensive update on the Tasmanian government's priorities right across agriculture, bio security, water management, fisheries and Veterans' Affairs. These are sectors that underpin our economy and sustain our regional communities.

During Estimates, I outlined that the Tasmanian agri-food sector continues to be a cornerstone of Tasmania's economy, now worth $2.46 billion at the farm gate. I reported to the committee that wine grape growers have achieved record yields of up to 35-37 per cent and opening new export markets right across the world. Dairy production remains robust, and fruit growers delivered strong exports, particularly cherries into Asia, blossoming - pardon the pun. Field crops such as cereals and poppies show promising price outlooks.

I also noted that during Estimates, that in October, [inaudible], and I realised something very wonderful when we released the paper on developing a new Tasmanian agricultural strategy, that builds on previous work that seeks feedback from industry on priorities such as innovation, smarter regulation, climate resilience and market expansion. 

Since 19-20, the government has invested over $34 million in agricultural research throughout Tasmania, through the Institute of Agriculture and industry partners contributing more than $66 million. I explained to the committee that Tasmanian Farm Innovation Hubs and Farm Business Resilience programs are helping farmers to adopt new technologies, new R&D and prepare for drought resilience and improve profitability. I emphasise also to the committee that the Tasmanian bee and pollination industries are absolutely essential and underpinning our agricultural industry.

To this end, we have reduced red tape by streamlining hive licencing. One licence now will cover multiple sites across paddocks rather than one licence per paddock, making life easier for our farmers and reducing that red tape. We have also released the Varroa Mite Action Plan of 2024-2034, developed with industry to help reduce risk and prepare for potential incursions. I explained to the committee that the Tasmanian poppy industry relies on its reputation as safe, secure and reliable growing region in Tasmania.

I reported the Poppy Advisory Control Board amended licence conditions in January 25. Growers are now required to approve the property rather than paddock by paddock, again making this easier, reducing red tape, making farmers get on with their business. These reforms provide flexibility while maintaining Tasmania's reputation as a secure supplier of pharmaceutical poppy material.

I advised the committee that while wild fallow deer are a part of Tasmania's heritage, deer increasingly present management challenges with deer increasingly impacting our peri-urban areas, agricultural and forestry areas, biodiversity and causing some safety risks. The budget commits $2.25 million to continue to deliver Tasmanian wild fallow deer management plans which will guide our approach to reduce the numbers.

Importantly, public consultation for the 2025 deer plan is now open, focusing on streamlining zone one and making zone three alpha a complete eradication zone. I reported also that our biosecurity systems is one of our greatest strengths here in Tassie. We continue to exclude evasive pests such as Varroa mite and Queensland fruit fly whilst preparing for high pathogenic Avian Influenza.

I highlighted to the committee that fresh water is a fundamental part of the Tasmanian economy, the environment and the Tasmanian way of life -

Mr ELLIS - Hear, hear.

Mr PEARCE - Mr Ellis. Tasmanian way of life is important and fresh water becomes an integral part of that. Our $10 billion by 2050 target will meet water in the right places for the right reasons to grow the right crops, again adding to the Tasmanian way of life, Mr Ellis. The Rural Water Strategy is our blueprint for managing water resources and our sustainability. Since 2021 over $60 million has been invested in science, policy, infrastructure initiatives, with an additional $440,000 in this year's budget.

The 2025 progress report shows tangible results, including extending the groundwater monitoring network, surveying over 500 boars in the Smithton Syncline alone, engaging with King Island and Flinders Island communities on water security and biosecurity sampling at 75 sites to track waterway health. I explained that the 16 major initiatives that are currently underway are deepening our understanding of water resources and refining our policy settings.

I was also pleased to advise the committee that the Tasmanian Irrigation system and scheme delivered over 93,000 megalitres of high surety water last year alone with major transfer systems and schemes underway, including the Northern Midlands Scheme, Sassafras Wesley Vale Augmentation and many others. These projects underpin long-term water security for our farm businesses and provide opportunities for increased productivity.

In the fisheries area, I reported to the committee that maintaining waterways for both commercial and recreational fishing remains our priority. The budget provides $1.3 million over the forward Estimates for the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies to continue world-class fishery research into core fisheries. The Tasmanian Fisheries White Paper sets out our pathway to modernised fisheries management and ensure that legislation can adapt sustainably in order to manage stocks.

I highlighted also that the Inland Fisheries Service continues to lead pest fish management for species such as redfin perch, terrible things, and tench. Targeted surveys for 2024-25 found no established populations thanks to electrofishing, where we zap those little pests. Netting and community engagement also assisted in removing those pests from our waterways. These efforts protected Tasmania, its unique freshwater ecosystems and supported recovery of valuable fishing resources.

Trout populations in Lake Sorell have rebounded strongly and deliver excellent angling opportunities, while Lake Crescent continues to be a renowned trophy-sized trout fishing attraction.

In the veterans' space, I was honoured to have updated to the Estimates Committee that the Tasmanian Government remains committed to the unwavering advocacy for our veteran community. Our state has an extraordinary legacy of service with 15 of Australia's 101 Victoria Cross recipients hailing from our great state. It's more per capita than any state or territory in the country. We have something to be proud of.

The Tasmanian government delivered practical, targeted support for our veterans through the Tasmanian Veterans Employment Strategy, supporting veterans to explore roles within the State Service align. The Veteran Wellbeing Voucher Program encourages healthy and connected lifestyles, now expanded to include widows and partners and those close to our veterans. Active engagement with veterans' reference groups ensures these policies are well aimed, well informed and are informed by the experience.

The Final Report of the Royal Commission into veterans' suicide, released on the 9 September 2024, made 122 recommendations. They include the establishment of the Veteran Wellbeing Agency. The Tasmanian government carefully reviews these recommendations and ensures alignment with national reforms.

Across agriculture, biosecurity, water management, fisheries and veterans' affairs, I was pleased to have presented to Estimates the practical, targeted and forward-looking initiatives being delivered by our government. These investments strengthen our economy, they safeguard our environment and they honour those who have served our nation and I'm proud to represent all of those important pillars in my portfolio responsibility. We remain committed with the government to ensure Tasmanian industries, our communities and our veterans are well supported, they're recognised and they're empowered for the future.

[7.45.14 p.m.]
Ms BADGER - Chair, I should start with an apology because when we were discussing in the House last time, extending the time for debate on the stadium, and we were talking about the length of time that we have to respond to big items such as the budget and I came in here and said we had 20 minutes for the Budget reply and 20 minutes for the Estimates reply, I was wrong. We have 30 minutes. We have an even longer time.

Reflecting how much of a disappointment that debate was due to the time constraints, when we have a budget situation, a financial situation in this state that is in such a poor situation that both Moody's and S&P have downgraded the state's credit rating, and what a time that is with the budget falling as well, but it's not only the financial mismanagement that we're going to see long-term impacts having on the Budget, but on the social fabric of this state as well. When we have organisations and NGOs that are missing out on funding, perhaps not in this interim Budget, but what's going to come in May, what has to come into the future? It's also going to impact our environment above all else because the funding into managing invasive species, into extending protected areas, into properly managing our protected areas, and upscaling what we can do, simply isn't there.

Member for Franklin, Mr O'Byrne, spoke in his address about how the Estimates process is changing and losing a bit of its scrutiny appeal and its ability to extract information. As far as not being able to extract information out of a minister and bad budgeting goes, the Parks minister absolutely took the cake. That was peak poor performance. Parks are going to be getting an extra $800,000 revenue by doubling the cost of parks passes for senior citizens, while they have $61 million in major projects and they could not provide any detail whatsoever on it because they were concepts, just concepts. These have been concepts: the Tyndall Range since 2021 and the Freycinet Gateway since 2019, that was a concept in 2017 when Matthew Groom, the then-minister, started playing around with the idea of what that might look like. That is not a concept now when we have contractors reaching out to our offices, to the community, and talking about the millions of dollars of concrete that they're going to be putting into this project, and yet we have Parks saying that they don't have that information available to us because it's just a concept. It's simply not right.

Speaking of budget mismanagement, up at the Tyndalls, there are three mining leases along the proposed walking track. They're not current, they're just exploration leases, but we have the exploration grant drilling initiative here in Tasmania, where if you're a mining company looking to explore possible minerals in the state, you can apply, and the state government will give you that grant to go out and do it. Since 2021, where you have three mining leases along a proposed walking track that the government's willing to put in $40 million, at least two of those mining leases have received a grant for mining exploration. Why are you paying them more taxpayer money to go out there to explore for minerals? What are you going to do if they actually found anything worth mining? Are you going to dump the Tyndalls walk? It makes absolutely no sense how that budget's been managed.

On Mount Field, we asked about the $7.8 million that is going to be invested into making Mount Field a year-round destination. Again, 'It's just a concept, we can't provide anything more than it would possibly be spent on some huts and walking tracks', which is just standard Parks work. In the story as old as time, two days after Estimates when we couldn't get told anything, of course, we received an RTI back that very explicitly showed us exactly the options and the details that were going on. That RTI had been fully explored with five different scoping options for how the money could be invested at Mount Field. It recommended option number five and that was dated March 2025. Yet, when we're asking about it in Estimates, we can't get that information. I'm not sure if the minister is just simply completely not across his portfolio or if he's misleading. Unfortunately, I think he's completely not across his portfolio because when I was asking about the TWWHA, the Tasmania Wilderness World Heritage Area, one of the highest-ranked Wilderness World Heritage areas on this planet, for which the Parks minister in this state is a custodian of, I asked him about the extensive cultural heritage assessment that has to happen on that property. There are 10 stages in that. It's been ongoing for years. We simply asked for an update, and he asked me more questions about what that process actually was than what I was able to ask him. Absolutely appalling.

On the reserve activity assessment (RAA) reforms, we asked the minister when the government was walking away from the options paper that they touted was going to go out after the full reforms that had been requested. There was a statement in that where the minister said they would be looking at streamlining coordination between the RAA and the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act (LUPAA) process. We asked what that meant. What does that mean for the future of the RAA process? We couldn't even get answers on that.

The special treatment of the proponent over at Lake Malbena and the Halls Hut continues stronger than ever. He wasn't even required to provide the six-monthly update through the government's EOI process - the 'unlocking our parks' process. Every single other proponent that has a project under that EOI process has to provide six-monthly updates. That could be local government updates, updates through the Environment Conservation and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) process, or simply the business case that they're refining to ensure that their product is modern and fit for purpose? Why is it that Daniel Hackett, the proponent for the Lake Malbena proposal, does not have to give six-monthly updates when everybody else does?

We also spoke about getting the TWWHA back onto the state of conservation reporting cycle for UNESCO. That's a really important reporting cycle because it means that that we have international oversight coming from bodies like the IUCN and ICOMOS. When we're seeing increasing dry lightning strikes and fire, really risking the both the natural values of the World Heritage area and the cultural values as well having that oversight and scrutiny and backing and support is incredibly important and yet there's no real talk and we've raised it in this place before and we've raised it with the premier and again, I got more questions from the minister about that than he got from me.

On fire, as the climate becomes more unstable and the weather is more predictable and more extreme events are growing in frequency and severity, we need greater investment into emergency services. It is crucial to ensure that they have the equipment, that we have the paid professionals on the ground, greater volunteer resources, they have the resources for planning and the response tools, options and contingency plans. It was heartening to hear from the TFS about the great work that they've been doing and off the back of this summer's fires where 100,000 hectares of wild places burnt, the mission that they took over to LA to learn from the fires over there and that's particularly important here in southern Tasmania, where we have the Derwent Valley and Hobart that are particularly dense urban areas, by Tasmanian standards, with enormous fire risks, that are almost unlike anything else on the planet. Having the TFS go over to LA to learn those lessons is fantastic and something that we should see continuing into the future.

It's heartening to hear as a part of their next steps of what we can do in Tasmania to stop the house-to-house ignition that really infiltrated and exacerbated what happened in LA. Looking at furthering the work, that Prof David Bowman at UTAS is already doing and the work that can be happening with RACT on mitigation, and some of the grants that have been looked at for home hardening projects, which is something that's already happening in the US. It will be very interesting to watch and see how that unfurls on a Tasmanian scale and how that might actually look.

SES volunteers are facing rising rescue demand and we've been hearing a lot, as I'm sure other members have, about volunteers who are paying out of their own pockets sometimes for rescue equipment. The uniform that they have on, has to be specialty, particularly if they're going into wilderness areas, dense areas of vegetation. It's concerning that, when we know that we're going to see an increase in rescues happening that there appears to be no plan to increase or provide sustained funding for the SES. Particularly, in the new TFES draft bill where it seems that the money will be drawn from the fire department. We look forward to learning more about that, hopefully before the May budget, so we can have proper scrutiny on what the future's going to look like because we know what's coming. We have to make sure that we have the resources and the supported personnel to deal with it and keep Tasmanians safe.

In the police hearing we had some serious concerns over the online crime reporting, the kind of amalgamation of the normal crime stoppers reporting into a Tasmanian police reporting that was due to be online in November last year. That's currently only delayed due to some technical issues that are ongoing, but it is promising to hear that that is still coming down the pipeline and to come after that initial crime reporting, will be the ability for victim/survivors to report sexual assaults online and we know that this is a really important part of the commission of inquiry and Weiss review recommendations. It is promising to hear that that is still happening.

In the prevention of domestic family and sexual violence space, the minister, Ms Howlett's work on the liquor licensing rebate reduction policy that the government has and ensuring that, as a part of that, family, domestic and sexual violence is very much prevalent - it's in the terms of reference for the review that's happening and it has to continue to be part of that conversation because we know the effects that it has and we've all seen the statistics of family, domestic and sexual violence in Tasmania at the moment. We cannot be doing enough in this space and I commend the minister for getting out the Family Violence Act review discussion paper, albeit pretty much bang on the day of the Estimates hearing and we only had an hour for what is an incredibly important topic that touches the lives of so many Tasmanians. We need to ensure that there is more time for this in the future and the critical documents, such as an act review, that there's more time for members to digest it and have a look at it. In saying that, I do appreciate that there is a long timeframe for feedback into that review. It is very much appreciated that it's not going to be a quick process and it's going to receive the respect that it deserves.

In skills and training, I, like everybody there, was devastated to hear about the 18 staff -17 teachers and an education manager - who are going to be made redundant two days before Christmas. Now, it wasn't that long ago under the 2021 act review or reform that it was clearly stated that no teachers would be worse off under the changes, that there wouldn't be any redundancies. Yet, we've seen automotive training in the south gutted, now we have arts, fashion, design and lab tech going, so what's next? Campus sales? That's what was touted in the 30-month act review. We asked about that review, it cited that the KPMG assessments, which were commissioned by TasTAFE, found that TasTAFE's 'footprint was too large' and that there were 'efficiencies to be found in the divestment of campuses.'

We asked for that KPMG assessment review, report, whatever it was, to be tabled and Mr Gardner from TAFE replied that the KPMG report, it is unfortunate that the 30-month review picked up on one line. We unfortunately had to break at that point, but it is unfortunate if it picked up on just one line that is otherwise a good piece of work or a terrible piece of work, but then after the break I wasn't in the room, member for Clark Ms Burnet was taking my place there. The response that we got was that the KPMG work was not available as it was not submitted as a report. It is an internal piece of advice that informed further internal work. That, of course, is despite the fact that it was referred to as a report twice previously in the hearing.

We also questioned about the Southern Automotive Centre and the new automotive centre out at Cambridge done in conjunction with the Tasmanian Automotive Chamber of Commerce and what the process was for getting that infrastructure up and running because, of course, there were other buildings, other locations that were touted previously, but this is the one that eventually a decision was made. So, what was that decision, how was it made and what process was gone through, for TAFE to be providing money for this new facility? We didn't really get an answer on what that process was, we were just told that there was nothing wrong with the process. I didn't ask if there was anything wrong with the process, I asked what the process was and, of course, now that we don't have an answer, we are more inclined to think, why was that conclusion immediately jumped to? Now, it does leave the question wide open about why you would assume that we thought the process was inept. Was it swayed to a particular developer to get this up and running?

On Primary Industries, we know that invasive species' populations are going up and the funding is not. On deer management, as a part of the response to what the government was doing, there was talk of the Australian Heritage Grant that the government's just received. Now, that's the second time that the government's received the Australian Heritage Grant. The first time, the grant was for $440,000 for deer management in the World Heritage area. The last time the Australian Heritage grant came through though, it was only $400,000 and it's not only for deer, it's for cats, it's for foxglove. Now, we are having less money that we have to do more for to spread seriously thinly. It's simply not good enough when we know the scale of the problem. The minister - the department also tabled the 15 conservation areas, reserves, FPPF land that is currently going through a level two RAA process to be opened up for recreational hunters. These are areas that are particularly high volume for tourists. There's Hardings Falls, of course, the Eastern Tiers is a spot that a lot of people go to, to look for swift parrots. I note a Level 2 RAA process does not include community input - that is despite there being tourism operators that go into some of these reserves to show Tasmania's natural environment.

We asked in the Police Estimates hearing about whether or not police were consulted on opening up these new conservation areas and reserves, and the answer was no. In fact, minister Felix Ellis said it was probably too early, at this stage, to be consulting on those lands. Well, we already have the 15 parcels of land; we know which ones they are. They're going under review through the RAA, so it should have already been consulted on well and truly, particularly when it's only a Level 2 RAA, so there won't be public consultation under that threshold. We echo our calls for Parks to reconsider that, or make an exception under the Level 2 RAA so that there is public consultation. That way, people who do use those areas for bushwalking or other recreation, or any tourism operators that have tours out there, can have their say, raise their concerns, and find out how they coexist in that space into the future.

In the Budget there is no extra funding for professional shooting of deer, concentrated shooting programs, or for the removal of the partial protections which still remain. We know that's what works, and we know that's what has to be done. How many reports and reviews are going to come out and continually reflect that that's what has to be done? Meanwhile in New South Wales, the legislation to repeal the 'Brumby Bill' that protected the heritage values of the horses in Kosciuszko has gone through. Tasmania needs to hurry up, catch up and protect our special wild areas.

There was no funding for cat management. We know that is a huge issue, particularly for local governments that are not resourced to deal with this growing issue. In the 2024-2029 cat management plan that doesn't exist, we still don't have an estimated time of when that draft is actually going to be complete, when it's going to be out for public comment. This is an issue, as with all invasive species - the sooner you get onto it, the sooner it can be fixed. We've knowingly had to do this work and just kicked the can down the road. Thank goodness the minister hasn't done that on deer, and has opened up public feedback for the 2027 plan slightly earlier.

With rabbits, it was fantastic to hear that the government has secured the calicivirus after the shortage issues and the reliance on the single lab that we have not only in Tasmania, but right across the nation. However, we have to ensure that the release happens under the right conditions at the right time of year, so that we don't see a repeat of what happened this time that we had the virus and into the future, so that it's actually effective and we can deal with those populations.

On rivers, it is incredibly disappointing and one of those things where you just bounce around from department to department, minister to minister, trying to get a result. It seems that no-one has bothered to do the environmental flows for Tasmania's rivers under the projected Marinus Link. Before Basslink came online in 2001, there was a fantastic series of studies and an incredibly dense amount of work done by Helen Lockyer on what the impacts of changed hydro flows could be to our river system. It was those reports that gave us a baseline for a lot of our river systems. It hadn't been properly investigated the whole way down. It's that report that showed us the health of the meromictic lakes at Lake Fidler, on the Gordon River, so that some attempt could be made to save them - although unfortunately, it was too late.

We have people on the Derwent River increasingly concerned - a river that has most of its water allocation already attributed to various landowners - wondering what it's going to mean for them under Marinus Link. You have berry farms and the like - this is not an area that's connected to Tasmanian Irrigation - wondering when they can take water from that riverway into the future, what are the flows actually going to mean?

The minister was talking about the Rural Water Use Strategy, which in past budgets has had around $200,000 over each of the forward Estimates each year, for various things, but in this interim Budget, it has $440,000 and that's it. What happens after that? Clearly, we are completely off track for what's recommended in the State of the Environment Report for actually looking after our waterways, for the monitoring that needs to occur. For all the reports we need to have staff on the ground, we need to have scientists out there actually looking at what's happening and projecting. We've made a decision, the government has pushed through a decision on Marinus, without proper consultation with members of this place or the community, and they haven't done any of the basic environmental assessments for it.

On that note, we're also getting bounced around on AI data centres. We've got one of the biggest AI factories in this nation, if not the world, coming to Launceston. What is planned by stage 2 of that proposal? Yet nobody - not the Planning minister, not the Primary Industries minister, not through anyone, really, certainly not the Innovation and Science minister - had any idea about the future planning of what that's actually going to mean for our state. 

You have the Office of the Coordinator-General spruiking our state as a key place for data centres for AI factories, yet no-one's looked at the planning of exactly where they should go. Where is the best place for them? Therefore, what's the best size of them? How much power are they going to consume? How much water are they going to use? Yes, the current Firmus proposal is spruiking a non-flammable, liquid cooling system. That's an incredibly novel technology that's only just come on board. If it doesn't work, where's the contingency plan for the water take? There certainly isn't any by the river at their proposed site.

If we're going to have these major consumers - and it is a major power consumer with absolutely minimal employment opportunities for local Tasmanians - coming into this state, sucking the energy dry, using our water systems, where's the actual planning for it prior to seeking major investment?

I echo the comments from other members in this place and to thank all the parliamentary staff, both in the parties, in the departments, the secretaries for the committees and in Hansard as well. It's an enormous amount of work that goes into Estimates at the best of times, let alone when it's in the middle of sitting weeks after a snap election and we're having not only budget Estimates but GBE scrutiny at the same time. They did a fantastic job and, really, we can't really express enough gratitude to them for the work that they've done.

As May approaches and we have the proper budget upon us, we're seeing an increase in community concerns grow, particularly those in the NGO sector - people from neighbourhood houses, for example, not knowing what's going to happen next. There's not a lot of confidence in what Tasmania's social economy is going to look like into the future. How can people be confident when their current services, be it health, education or housing, are already under pressure now? That will only grow under a budget that just delivers compounding debt above all else.

[8.13 p.m.]
Mrs GREENE (Bass) - Chair, from the outset, I would also like to place on record my sincere thanks to the hard-working public servants who have spent countless hours preparing brief after brief for Estimates. Their professionalism, dedication and attention to detail ensure that ministers are properly informed and that the scrutiny of government can take place transparently and effectively. I know that work is demanding, often time-pressured and rarely acknowledged publicly, but it's also vital to our democracy. Thank you for your care and expertise and commitment that you bring in serving the Tasmanian community. 

Estimates exposed a number of serious matters that I will touch on today. It exposed a pattern - a culture of detachment, avoidance, incompetence and political decision-making that leaves everyday Tasmanians carrying the cost. Nowhere was that clearer than in the Children and Youth portfolio. Let's start with the Strong Families Safe Kids advice and referral line (ARL), which is the front door to child safety in this state. Since its commencement in 2018, the advice and referral line has experienced steady growth in the number of contacts it receives each year. In many ways, this reflects an increasing awareness and trust in the service from community and stakeholders. However, more recent system and legislative reforms, including the implementation of the Child Safe Principles, the establishment of the Office of the Independent Regulator, and the commission of inquiry into institutional responses to child sexual abuse, have contributed to significant shifts in both the volume and the complexity of demand reaching the ARL. 

It's not only call numbers that are rising. The level of risk, the seriousness of those reports, and the time that is required to ensure children's safety have been escalated. Yet the government has not matched that escalating workload with resources needed to keep children safe.

What we heard in Estimates was not a story of reform. It's a case of band-aid fixes and under-investment in child safety services. Call volumes have been rising year on year. Initially back in 2018, there were about 12,900 calls to the ARL. Now it's closer to 22,000 calls. That is a huge shift, but there hasn't been any additional staff put into that service.

We know that burnout for staff is becoming the new normal. There are really high rates of workers' compensation for these staff, mainly psychological injury, and children are waiting longer for help. The government's solution, you might ask? Well, there were no plans to increase staffing; we didn't hear anything about that. There's no structural change on the agenda.

What is positive in this space was the Workforce Incentive Program, but that, again, is just another band-aid measure and, unfortunately, it seems the government couldn't even deliver that. They promised an extra $100 a week to entice workers to stay, and that was really welcomed by staff last year, but that temporary payment ran out in June. It was meant to be extended until December whilst the Allied Health Professionals Agreement was being negotiated, but that deal has yet to be struck. Workers in July, August, September, October and November, and even the start of December, I'm led to believe, still have not received their incentive payment. It's going to be back paid. They shouldn't have had to have waited five months for that money that was promised to them months ago. There was no reasonable explanation from the minister about the delay to those incentive payments. I also note that those payments were only offered to allied health professional staff within child safety services. There was no incentive payment for other key roles like disability liaison officers, support workers or unit coordinators, and those staff all do really important roles within child safety services.

We also learnt in Estimates that the government has done yet another review for the advice and referral line and, of course, outsourced the wait list at a cost of over $800,000 for just 12 weeks' work with Tradewind, so think about that. When children needed help, the government didn't build capacity, didn't build its own expertise, didn't back its own people. They sub-subcontracted responsibility and then they called it 'expanding the workforce'. Outsourcing the child safety wait list is not good enough. It was an emergency patch on a system that has already failed. 

Tradewind were contracted to progress up to 1700 conversations initially over an eight-week period, but that contract was extended for another four weeks and completed, in the end, 1120 conversations. A substantial number of matters involved concerns relating to sexual abuse and child exploitation material consisting of both recent and historical concerns. These matters should not have been outsourced to a labour hire company, and concerningly, over that 12-week period, six of those labour hire staff chucked the towel in. One of them gave up after week three. There were more in weeks five, six and seven.

I've been hearing from workers that labour hire staff didn't have access to all the information that they needed, like police reports, so practice managers and practice leaders were sending them information in Excel spreadsheets via email. That is simply not good enough. What is most disturbing is that the minister said during Estimates that if she was in the same position as the former minister, with a huge backlog, that she would have done the same thing. I would really hope that the minister will consider what she said during Estimates. Perhaps it's something that she can reflect on over Christmas, because our kids deserve better.

The ARL review identified structural confusion and duplication, staff reported feeling anxious and there is a serious problem when it comes to clarity of roles. The review also found that there were wait times of on average one hour and 22 minutes to get through to the advice and referral line. One hour and 22 minutes - that is not good enough. Then, when they finally get through to speak to someone, the conversation, on average, is about 14 minutes. Staff were then reporting they were spending considerable time on admin or taking phone calls that weren't even related to children on their wait list, so they were having to, once again, duplicate and hand over case file notes to other workers who were unavailable when somebody called.

Instead of releasing the review so that the sector and workers and advocates could learn from it and improve the system, the government locked it away. The document has now been presented at my request. So, my question is, if everything's going so well, why hide the evidence? And if everything's improving, why did they need to outsource the waitlist? These are not just statistics, they are children. A child who's been reported to ARL is waiting for safety. A family that needs support and cannot get a call back is not a line item, they are trying to survive. These are complex cases, families with complex issues, it's really not good enough. Of course, caseworkers who are overwhelmed with work, are trying to do the impossible and every day support is delayed, the risk doesn't stay still, it escalates. We cannot reform child safety via LinkedIn posts from the department, we cannot protect children with branding and graphics and new job titles and think that that's going to make a difference and we cannot announce change after change and just hope that it's going to work because children in this state need more than hope. We need to properly resource the system.

Through Estimates, we also heard reference after reference to vacancies, burnout and turnover, not just in child safety services, but everywhere the government relies on the public service to protect people because, the truth is, a system is only as strong as the people who keep it running. If you hollow out the workforce, you hollow out the system. If you don't have enough child safety staff, children wait, and if you don't have enough forensic staff, justice waits. If we don't have enough radio dispatch staff, emergencies wait, and if we don't have enough teachers and TAs and professional support staff, then learning waits and kids fall through the cracks. When the public service struggles, Tasmanians struggle.

We saw the same failures across police, fire and emergency management. Forensic science services have been under immense workload pressure for years. They are essential, they're how we solve crimes and how we deliver justice. If we cannot process evidence quickly, investigations stall, victims wait longer, our courts clog up and offenders remain free in the community. Yet, in Estimates, when asked how long the delays are and how they are being fixed, the minister couldn't provide a plan and it's worse than that, we learned that there are 789 unstarted DNA cases. They were sexual assault samples, and they have been sitting untouched since January of this year. That means that survivors, families, and the accused are all waiting because the system is overwhelmed. When governments fail to properly resource forensic science services, the consequences aren't just theoretical, they are real, devastating and already playing out across Australia.

Queensland is the cautionary tale. They underfunded their service, there were backlogs and pressure to do more with less and that led to catastrophic delays, systemic failures and, ultimately, a commission of inquiry that found thousands of DNA samples had been incorrectly reported at levels too low to detect, meaning vital evidence was dismissed, investigations derailed, and families denied justice. Survivors of violent crime were forced to wait months and sometimes years for answers. Offenders who should have been caught earlier remained free in the community. Court cases collapsed and public trust was shattered. Forensic science isn't a luxury, it's the backbone of a functioning justice system and when the government cuts corners, under-resources labs or ignores warnings from experts, the price is paid by victims, families, frontline workers and the safety of our communities.

At the same time, and this is really extraordinary, we heard in Estimates of the disaster that is the Launceston Reception Prison. A building infested with rats - yes, rats. Broken plumbing, failing intercoms, and it only has three showers and that's often for about 40 remandees. The minister himself admitted on the record that it is not fit for purpose and hasn't been for quite some time. So, we have a prison the government knows is unfit, holding people who are waiting for court appearances, which are delayed because Forensic Science Services is backlogged. If that isn't a system in crisis, what is?

This government talks about law and order, but the reality is we have rats in remand and rape kits sitting in freezers. No spin can cover that up. That is failure, pure and simple. Our community deserves so much better.

Other parts of our justice and community safety system are in trouble, too. Calls to radio dispatch services drop out in 15 per cent of cases before anyone is even able to pick up the phone. Their rosters are also a nightmare. These are Tasmanians who are calling in distress, they're calling 000 or the non-urgent line and they are desperate for help, but disconnected. That's not just a service challenge, that could be the difference for them between life and death. It might be the only time they feel brave enough to reach out - they might be calling about a family violence matter. It is simply not good enough. Our courts are backlogged and member for Clark and shadow attorney-general has already outlined the resourcing constraints of Legal Aid. I encourage you to go and have a look at that contribution if you weren't able to listen.

Community services funding is now on the chopping block, too. This comes at the exact same moment that complexity of cases are rising, demand for services is exploding, family violence services are overwhelmed, and multicultural organisations are dealing with increased safety concerns, especially post the anti-immigration rallies, which should be condemned by every member of this place. Neighbourhood Houses and charities are seeing record need in our community.

The government's budget papers confirm a reduction in forward Estimates for the community sector, and we know that organisations received letters from the government saying, 'What services can we cut, what can we trim?' That's not what they need to be hearing from government right now, I can tell you. If we weaken community services, you do not save money, you simply shift the cost into hospitals, into policing, homelessness services and the child safety system. A responsible government would reinforce the community sector, not starve it.

We saw this same behaviour across every portfolio, broken promises, delayed commitments, blame shifting, no accountability and some ministers simply refusing to own their own decisions. We saw that in Question Time today, with the North Launceston Football Club with $100,000 promised that's now been pulled because the club met with the opposition during the election period. You can dress it up how you like, that's what happened - the club know it, the community know it, and we will hold this government accountable for that awful decision.

We know that Surf Life Saving rescue services have been whisked away from the clubs who have been providing it for years and I'd love to hear an explanation for that from government. We also know that school infrastructure in my electorate of Bass has been delayed. That's Mowbray Primary School and Port Dalrymple being pushed further and further away from students who were looking forward to those upgrades to their schools.

This was my first ever Estimates and I must say, I was pretty disappointed with the deflection from ministers not providing answers and some ministers seeming to be offended by us asking the very question. That is not leadership. I note for Committee B, Mr Duigan is yet to provide answers to his questions on notice, so hopefully that can be addressed soon, that is simply not good enough.

All of this might sound quite political, but the consequences are anything but. Children waiting for safety, families waiting for support, victims waiting for justice, community organisations waiting for certainty, emergency responders waiting for staffing and resourcing that they deserve, schools waiting for infrastructure and volunteers waiting for promises to be honoured. When governments don't do their job, people get hurt. What we heard in Estimates was not simply a lack of answers, it was a lack of concern. I guess that's what really struck me out of Estimates. A government that cannot face reality is a government that cannot solve problems.

Tasmania deserves better. We deserve a child safety system that measures outcomes and invests in its workforce; a forensic service that delivers timely justice for those who are relying on it; a prison system that doesn't hold people and facilities that aren't fit for purpose, that are filled with rats and broken plumbing - that's just not good enough. Tasmanians deserve someone to pick up the phone when they call the RDS, not to have 15 per cent of phone calls drop out; our community services sector needs to be strengthened, not cut, and we need ministers who will listen to their stakeholders and their communities and not punish them for talking to other people when they were just trying to get the best outcome for their club. We want a government that honours its word, not its spin.

Governments are judged on how well they treat the vulnerable, the sick, the elderly and the young, and this government is setting the bar very low for our community at the moment. Every Tasmanian deserves a government that measures success, not by announcements but by results, and that's what I will be holding you to account for. Thank you.

Progress reported. Committee to sit again.


ADJOURNMENT

[8.31 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House do now adjourn.

Motion agreed.


Answer to Question - Tasracing
Answer to Question - Macquarie Point - Contaminated Soil

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, in support of that motion, can I respond to some questions that were raised by member for Franklin Mr Winter, to the Premier in relation to Tasracing? The answer is:

I note the questions about this matter were put by the member and answered at the Tasracing scrutiny committee hearings on 26 November. As previously advised, this was an operational matter and the decision made by the company. 

I'm advised the Chair took immediate action when alerted to the post and has spoken to the CEO about his actions. As a state-owned company, Tasracing is not covered by the State Service Act. This was a matter for that Tasracing board and the Chair has already addressed it during the scrutiny committee hearing. If the member has other allegations, he can make them to the appropriate authorities.

Can I also provide further information in response to the question attempted to be asked by the Leader of the Greens and, in fact, asked by member for Clark Ms Burnet, in relation to what they falsely alleged was misleading evidence by the MPDC. What has occurred is that the Greens have confused volume with weight. One cubic metre of fill or soil does not equal 1 tonne, in fact it is equivalent to about 1.7 tonnes. As both MPDC advised in Estimates and I in a question on notice taken during the Estimates, MPDC advised that it estimated that about 130,000 cubic metres of fill would need to be moved from the site to facilitate construction of the stadium. If you multiply that by 1.7 to convert this volume to weight, we get approximately 220,000 tonnes. Cue breathless releases claiming that the EPA was providing a different figure to that of the MPDC was misleading. As I said in my answer this morning, to accuse public servants of misleading when they cannot defend themselves, and if the Greens would have asked 'how can you explain the difference?' we could have got the information without these terrible allegations being made about our officials.

Dr Woodruff - Suck on your own hypocrisy and look at what you did to Nicholas Gruen and the Planning Commission panel.

The SPEAKER - Order. Dr Woodruff, you can make your own contribution.

Dr Woodruff - Suck on your own hypocrisy.

The SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff.

Mr ABETZ - This has to stop, because when the Greens - I think it's only the Greens, in fact, make these sort of allegations against our officials - it is unfair, it's unreasonable and on this occasion completely and utterly untrue. It was a Greens mistake that has led them to this situation. I invite the Greens, should they speak on the Adjournment this evening, to apologise to the MPDC.

Can I also indicate that the Copping C Cell can take 45,000 cubic metres of level 3 material annually, and, in fact, it can take even 45,000 tonnes of level 3 material annually.

Dr Woodruff - How's it going to deal with 220,000 tonnes? Four times the amount.

The SPEAKER - Order, Dr Woodruff, you can make your own contribution on Adjournment soon.

Mr ABETZ - Not all of the material to be removed is level 3 material. Once again, contaminated material, but there are levels of contamination and it's only level 3 that has to go to Copping. The other levels can be used in other areas which has occurred. 

In this desperate attempt to denigrate anything to do with Macquarie Point, the multipurpose stadium, the Greens go on this jihad against anybody who supports the stadium and that includes good, hard-working public servants of this state who do not deserve the sort of denigration and personal attacks, personal vilification that they have suffered in recent times courtesy of the Greens. 

To be clear, the volume and quality of fill likely to be removed is within the industry's capacity and Copping C Cell to manage. I again invite all members to ensure that before they make allegations against our public servants, they get the facts together so that they don't make those sorts of statements. I call on the Greens to apologise to the MPDC.


Paul Reynolds - Institutional Response

[8.37 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to talk about a very deeply serious matter tonight that I would expect should concern all members. It relates to outstanding questions relating to actions taken or not taken by senior members of Tasmania Police and the state government in relation to former police officer Paul Reynolds. 

It's well known that Reynolds abused and exploited teenage boys over a period of at least 30 years. The facts of that were established by the Weiss Review, which reported to government last year. However, despite this review being undertaken, a number of serious and important questions remain about Reynolds and the institutional responses to his actions, responses made during his life, and after his death. These questions continue unanswered because the Weiss Review's terms of reference were too narrow, and its powers too weak to enable a full and proper examination of relevant matters. 

This problem has again been rearticulated in recent days in the latest episode of the podcast Badge of Betrayal, produced and hosted by Jay Walkerden. The series takes a close look at the Reynolds matter and in the new episode, episode 3, Mr Walkerden speaks to a currently serving senior officer in Tasmania Police. The police officer is unambiguous. He describes the Weiss Review as, 'A failed inquiry.' To be clear, the police officer doesn't blame Regina Weiss, who was the appointed reviewer of the Paul Reynolds investigation, for the failure. Not at all. What he says is that, 'The terms of reference, when you look at it, never allowed it to be successful.'

I don't think we can overestimate how much bravery it would take or how much concern this officer must hold in order for them to speak out, but we are so glad that they've done this, and that Mr Walkerden has given them this platform because since the day the government announced the Weiss Review, the Greens have maintained it was set up in a way that made it impossible to answer the questions that need to be answered for the full truth to come out. The government did not initiate this review because they thought it was necessary or the right thing to do. They were pushed into it after the Greens publicly called for actions and after other members of parliament supported our call. When the government conceded and announced a review would occur, the terms of reference were written personally by the Police Commissioner. We expressed our strong concerns about both the narrow scope and weak powers of the review. In particular, we criticised the fact it did not cover an investigation about the decision to award Paul Reynolds with a full-honours police funeral. I quote from my statement from that day, 6 October 2023:

It is good news to see an independent investigation has been announced, but we are troubled to see the inadequate terms of reference that have been set by the Commissioner of Police. It also appears the investigation has not been given the power to compel witnesses, order the production of evidence, or refer individuals for prosecution. This investigation should be empowered to look at this deeply serious issue in full without being hobbled from the outset.

A week later I wrote to Police minister, Felix Ellis, to reiterate these concerns and suggested a much more comprehensive terms of reference. Minister Ellis denied this request and I still don't know why he wouldn't want to do everything to make sure the review was comprehensive.

The Weiss Review was released on the 4 July 2024. As predicted, it left important questions unanswered. At the time I made a statement that called for further action, saying:

This report has shone a light on extensive abuse. However, unfortunately, it did not have the scope to address all relevant matters or sufficient powers to undertake the full investigation required. We called for the government to refer the unanswered questions about Paul Reynolds with all available evidence to the Integrity Commission so it could do a complete investigation with the powers it needed to compel evidence, but this was not done.

Again, I can't find a sensible reason to explain why Police minister Ellis has never taken these steps.

As a result of this inaction, it is still the case today that the questions about officer, Paul Reynolds, known to have exploited and abused boys over years, have not been satisfactorily investigated, and critical questions remain unexamined. The Greens are very concerned about this matter

I foreshadow that I will further contribute to this matter tomorrow evening.


Ice Sports in Tasmania

[8.42 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to talk in relation to the Ice Sports report that I tabled earlier today. This is a report with regards to the closure of the rink in 2022 and Ice Sports Tasmania (IST) has continually been provided with anecdotal evidence of this, including reports of decline in athletes' psychological functioning, disruptions to their sense of belonging and identity, reduced self-worth, increased stress and difficulty coping, increase in maladaptive coping strategies and, in some cases, has resulted in significant episodes of poor mental health resulting in the need for professional support.

I should say before I continue that I do recommend to anyone who is struggling at the moment to reach out to a number of services if they find themselves with poor mental health to Beyond Blue, Headspace, Anglicare or Relationships Australia in particular. I urge people listening today to reach out if they do need help.

For this reason, IST, in conjunction with psychologist, Dr Katie Dykes, conducted a quantitative study on the mental health impacts of the rink closure. Psychometric measures were used to assess the mental health impacts and current symptoms experienced by athletes, children and adults and parents and carers of athletes. Results confirm the closure of Tasmania's only ice sports facility in 2022 has had a profound and measurable impact on the mental health of athletes and families across the state. In fact, data shows an alarming rate of clinically significant depression, anxiety, stress and trauma-related symptoms in both children and adults, with many experiencing severe or extreme levels of psychological distress related to having no rink accessible in our home state. Individuals have lost access to a critical protective factor for their mental health and wellbeing.

The findings demonstrate the absence of a permanent ice sports facility is directly related to a serious and escalating mental health issue for Tasmanians. I urge members to look at the report that I tabled earlier today. It details some very distressing facts. It showed in this report that when it comes to young athletes under the age of 18, the impact the rink closure shows that 80 per cent are experiencing psychological distress directly linked to the rink's closure; 60 per cent are experiencing severe post-traumatic stress symptoms. When it comes to mental health symptoms, 60 per cent of under eighteens are experiencing mental health symptoms or distress considered to be within a severe or extremely severe range. 

When it comes to adult athletes participating in ice sports, again, the impact of the rink closure shows that 43 per cent are experiencing severe post-traumatic stress symptoms. When it comes to mental health symptoms, 86 per cent are experiencing mental health symptoms or distress. Of course, this has a flow on effect to parents and carers with 80 per cent reporting to experiencing notable or severe post-traumatic stress symptoms as a result of the rink closure and its impact on their children.

What does this mean for the ice sports community, a very close knit community? The closure has created significant mental health impacts across all age groups. Young people are showing particularly high levels of stress and trauma. Adults and parents are also experiencing severe anxiety and post-traumatic stress. This really does reinforce the urgent need for stable, safe and permanent access to ice sports facilities alongside mental health support for the whole sporting community.

Ice Sports Tasmania understands that this is a challenging situation for many and, again, if this does invoke some stress or distress for individuals, I encourage them to reach out to support services. 

In the little time that I have left, I remind members that it wasn't that long ago, October 2023, that this House considered a motion that I put forward to support the ice sporting community. They are a sport in Tasmania without a home, without a place and without facilities. That's been the case since 2022 and this House unanimously, with support across the political divide, supported a call for this government to fund an ice sports rink facility in Tasmania within the 2024-25 Budget.

That hasn't happened, and this community has been left without a facility. Whilst we debate, in the other place, the addition of a third stadium to Tasmania, I think it's a really timely reminder that we have a grassroots sporting community that don't have a facility at all for their particular sport. Participants are forced to go to the mainland to participate, or not engage at all. They're losing their community and the mental health impacts of this are really clear. I urge members of the House to engage with Ice Sports Tasmania, to hear from them themselves the impact of this. Thank you.


Regional Events

[8.47 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I rise on the Adjournment tonight to speak about a number of great community events that have been held across my electorate of Braddon over the last few months. I want to start by stating the importance of regional events not only to community wellbeing but to regional economies.

The first event that I want to talk about was the Tulip Festival which, again, was outstanding this year. This is an event that's been around for 34 years, and each year continues to impress the community and grow and become a stronger community event. There were concerns about the weather - it was pretty wet underfoot, but it was a terrific day and certainly, the crowds turned out and enjoyed another spectacular Tulip Festival in the beautiful and quaint town of Wynyard. 

A bit's been said about the town of Penguin and its 150th birthday and the celebrations that have continued for the entirety of this year. A little while ago, we held a street party in Penguin to celebrate the town and the people that have made it what it is over the years, including the local Dutch community. I just wanted to give a shout-out to the committee who have been organising all of those events across this year to celebrate Penguin's 150th birthday. Our colleague in the upper House, Casey Hiscutt, has played a pivotal role in that, and Greg and Penny Hall and a number of other committee members have done an outstanding job. I just want to state again on the record, and congratulate the 'Big Penguin' on 50 years, and his 50th birthday as well, or her 50th birthday. Its 50th birthday.

I also want to talk about the Burnie Show, which was a little while ago now. It was another day that could have suffered from the weather but didn't. It was pretty windy, but everybody was still out enjoying the rides and enjoying everything that the Burnie Show has to offer. It's been going strong now for many, many years and I want to congratulate the show society on what they have done with their new site and the way that they've reinvented this great community tradition. A great time was had by all and it was my great pleasure to attend, and I thank them for what they bring to the community through the show each year.

The next event that I want to talk about is the Queenstown Unconformity Festival, which was absolutely amazing. I was only able to go for one day, but on the Sunday that I attended, when they had the footy match on the gravel oval, I attended the toast and had a look at some of the great artwork that was on display as part of that outstanding community festival. My only regret, really, was I didn't get to see Spiderbait play on the Saturday night, which I would have loved. By all accounts it was fantastic, so I missed out. Maybe next time, in a couple of years' time when there's another great band that comes to Queenstown.

Whilst we're on the west coast, a couple of weeks ago I attended the Mineral and Gem Fair that's held in Zeehan, which is another outstanding community event that celebrates the history of Zeehan and our rich mining culture and industry across the west coast. I want to give a shout-out to the heritage museum staff and the local council who work together to host that event each year. The community was very well represented, with the Men's Shed there and a number of different stalls and experiences for people. I will just say that the fish and chips from Stanley were great as well, from the guys there that were selling those. What a great event that was on the west coast.

The final event I want to talk about is the Stanley Show, which I attended on Saturday. It is always a great community rural show which never disappoints, and it was very well attended on Saturday. There was something for everyone, from great livestock exhibitions to the animal nursery, to arts and crafts, and the talents of the young schoolchildren on display and some outstanding cooking. I wished I'd had the opportunity to enter my sponge cake. I always think that when I go. I love to cook and I always think that I should have entered some of my things in the exhibitions, but I never get around to it. There were some great, beautiful floral displays as well, being such a beautiful time of the year for floral displays.

Thanks to everybody who made a contribution to that show. It was certainly well attended and I enjoyed it. I think it just goes to show the commitment across our communities, right across Braddon, to bring great quality events for the community to enjoy and to celebrate what's special about our electorate. Thanks, Honourable Speaker.

The SPEAKER - I think you need to bring some sponge cake to Question Time.


Federal Labor - Impact of Policy on Tasmanian Native Forest Industry

[8.51 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I want to talk about the most urgent matter facing our state at the moment. It amazes me that it hasn't been brought up at question time this morning. It wasn't the subject of the matter of public importance raised by the Labor Party this morning, and you'd nearly think it was not an issue at all. That is, of course, what Labor federally have done to our forest industry here in Tasmania.

In 2004, Mark Latham, the Leader of the federal Labor Party, declared war on the forest industry with a policy that he took to that federal election to shut down native forests operations in our state. It was vigorously fought against by the John Howard-led government of the coalition and the then-Paul Lennon Labor government, and we won that matter. It seems like you nearly need to set your alarm clock; every 10 or 15 years they come knocking again.

In 2012-13, Julia Gillard, in a minority federal parliament, did a deal with Bob Brown, Lara Giddings and Nick McKim, and they had a similar policy to lock up hundreds of thousands of hectares of native forest in Tasmania, with the same objective to shut down native forest operations jobs in regional communities. We didn't win that battle, we lost that battle. We lost it nobly. We fought it late into the morning in this House, but ultimately, on the basis of a Labor-Greens government in this House, we lost that battle.

The alarm clock's going off again, and I am very alarmed at what has happened, 12 years later. The federal Albanese Labor government, in the dead of night, have done a deal with the federal Greens party to strip away the legal protections of Tasmania's Regional Forest Agreement (RFA). It surprises me that anyone would find it amusing, because it is a very serious matter. It's so serious, proven by how pleased the Greens are, the high-fiving Greens, at what they've achieved in Canberra. That battle happened very quickly, very quietly, almost secretly. It happened, and then it was over. The deal has been done, and tonight, as I stand here, it's the law. 

The federal Labor government have stripped away the legal status of Tasmania's RFA, signed by John Howard, Prime Minister, and Tony Rundle, Premier, a long time ago - I think in 1998 - providing resource security for Tasmania's forest industry, which has been the basis for job security, which has been the basis for investment security, which has been the basis for the revival that we've been able to see in our forest industry since the election of the Hodgman government in 2014, which tore up that appalling deal.

Labor ministers are now scrambling, having done this terrible deal - a dirty deal - to hit the airwaves and try and convince Tasmanians and forest communities that there's really nothing much to worry about, 'You have 18 months to get ready for this.' Get ready for what? 'Eighteen months is plenty of time to get compliant, compliant with what? Isn't it already the case that Tasmania runs forestry better than anywhere else on Earth? After all, that's what Labor have said until recently. It is a betrayal of the state of Tasmania. I believe that the state opposition in this House is happy to allow that betrayal to go quietly by. They should be raising the alarm as we do on this side of the House. It worries me that some of them really do want this.

Of course, Labor's federal member for Bass in the April run-up to the May election did a radio interview with the ABC. The question from the journalist was, 'You're putting that pressure back on the state government to make a decision there, would you like to see the Tasmanian state government end native forest logging?' The answer from Ms Teesdale, and the ABC reports in square brackets 'long pause', then, 'Yes.' Well, Ms Teesdale later that same day walked those comments back and said that the Albanese Labor government is not changing its policy on native forest logging. Of course, this was to say, 'Hey, don't worry about what I said before, we're good on forestry.' Well, Labor isn't good on forestry and they've sold our people out.

This side of the House are not satisfied with those reassurances and will fight it. And I congratulate Sussan Ley and the federal Coalition for also pledging to fight it because this battle needs to be won for those 5700 forestry families in our state.

Tasmania's Young People

[8.57 p.m.]
Prof RAZAY (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, today, I would like to pay tribute to our inspiring young Tasmanians. At a time when young people are under so many pressures, including increasing cost of living, housing shortages and high education costs, it is understandable that many young people are struggling to see a positive future. I want to speak about something that sits at the heart of every thriving Tasmanian community, strong family, and hopeful future, the importance of inspiring young people.

Young people are not just the leaders of tomorrow, they are leaders of today. They are shaping culture, challenging old ways of thinking, and bringing fresh ideas to problems we have been wrestling with for decades. To unlock that potential, however, they need more than opportunity. They need inspiration, the spark that tells them they are capable, valued and able to make a difference, even when the going gets tough. Inspiration matters because it changes the way young people see themselves. When a young person feels inspired, they begin to imagine new possibility. They start to believe in their own capacity for growth. They take risk, they try, they fail, they try again and that's how confidence and resilience is built. Without that spark, their world becomes smaller, but with it, everything opens up.

When we inspire young people, the benefits come back to all of us. Inspired young people contribute ideas that help solve community challenges and they inspire other young people. They bring energy and creativity into the workplace. They show compassion, fairness and willingness to confront injustice. They remind us of what's possible when hope and opportunity meet. 

Inspiration alone is not enough. We also need to build environments where young people can thrive. That means safe spaces, accessible support, meaningful choices and the freedom to explore who they are. It means trusting them, including them and valuing their lived experience. It means recognising that every young person has a story, and each story deserves respect. An article in today's Examiner celebrates 40 inspiring young people. Some are young entrepreneurs, some are young athletes and coaches, some are disabled athletes, some are artists and curators, some apprentices, some are performers and musicians, some are academics and some are advocates for important causes, some are innovators and some are even young parliamentarians, including this parliament's Labor MP, Jess Greene.

At a time when 47 per cent of young people drop out out of school after year 10, we must do more to motivate young people to undertake further vocational training in areas they are interested in or feel passionate about. Not all young people want to go to further tertiary education, preferring instead to enter the workforce to gain experience. We must address skill shortages and encourage young people to consider careers in areas such as engineering. People from low socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to drop out of education, so we need to do more to address inequality among our young people.

If we want a stronger future, we must actively lift up young people today. Let us mentor them through mentor programs and encourage, challenge and celebrate them. Let us help them see the greatness they may not yet see in themselves because when young people are inspired, they don't just imagine a better world, they create one.

Dream Again Mentoring Program

[9.01 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, last Thursday I was privileged to attend the graduation of students from the Dream Again Mentoring program, a partnership of the Be Hers Foundation and TasTAFE, which supports women from refugee and migrant backgrounds to develop skills in sewing and retail cosmetics. You were there, Speaker, so too was the Leader of the Opposition and other members for Clark, Ms Haddad, Mr Vermey, and Hobart's Deputy Lord Mayor, Dr Zelinda Sherlock.

Be Hers have raised millions of dollars for women who in other countries are fleeing from slavery, exploitation and domestic violence. Their Dream Again Mentoring program, which has run for a few years, has shifted the focus to migrant women here in Tasmania and it has also lifted those women's skills, their hopes and their aspirations. Women like Aimen, a young mother of two who was there with her husband, and my friend's, Sonya, mother who escaped, is a Hazaras woman who escaped Afghanistan many years ago.

As we know, unemployment and underemployment are significant issues for refugee and migrant women who are who are more likely to find it difficult to find work than their male counterparts. There's a 2023 report by the Victorian state government that says that just 47.3 per cent of culturally and linguistically diverse women were able to secure work, compared to 69.5 per cent of men. There are complex and multifaceted reasons for this, including racial prejudice, being denied career advancement and mentoring opportunities, limited recognition of overseas qualifications and experience, prior trauma, lack of cultural safety and exposure to culturally motivated sexism in the workplace, and a greater likelihood of working casual, unsafe and exploitative roles.

The Be Hers Foundation has been working to create opportunities for refugee and migrant women in Tasmania and to empower them to enter the job market. It was clear that both students who had done the sewing or the cosmetics course had relished their experiences and had grown in confidence. You could just see it in their demeanour and in their faces during that course.

TAFE sewing teacher, Katrina, showed how keen the women had been. They took to the industrial sewing machines like ducks to water, didn't want to take breaks nor leave at the end of the class. It was one of those situations where you could see for the cosmetics teacher and Katrina and mentors alike, that they got as much out of the program as the participants.

There was joy at this graduation, but the reality is that some of these women will not have the option of studying and learning when the minister, Mr Ellis, cuts these TAFE courses. With the Tasmanian Liberal government announcing cuts to TasTAFE, including 18 staff roles and cuts to the areas of design, screen and media, music, fashion, visual arts and lab technology, the future of this program is unclear. These women are the human faces of cuts to courses that seem expendable. This is the human cost, which is a travesty. The most vulnerable members of our community will be robbed of taking those important first steps to independence and skills.

I implore the minister, Mr Ellis, on behalf of women like Aimen and Sonya's mum who is a refugee who had fled persecution and has had to deal with mental anguish with family separated by war, who were at the graduation ceremony and Sonya's mum told the audience that she has found purpose and it has been a lifesaver for her to graduate from this course, to interact with other women and to have such good training and skills. Please do not cut these TAFE courses that make such a difference in the lives of women like Sonya's mum, so that Be Hers can continue to do their work alongside migrant women, teachers and mentors alike.


Dementia in Tasmania

[9.06 p.m.]
Mrs ARCHER (Bass - Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing) - Honourable Speaker, to acknowledge the inaugural Parliamentary Friends of Dementia roundtable today that I was honoured to co-host with fellow members for Bass, Prof Razay and Ms Rosol. Working together, this forum reflects our shared commitment to improving the lives of Tasmanians living with dementia.

Dementia is a significant and growing health issue in Australia and has a substantial impact on the health and quality of life of people living with the condition, as well as their family, friends and carers. In 2024, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimated that there were 425,000 Australians living with dementia, which equates to 16 people with dementia per 1000 Australians. This means that most of us present here tonight are likely to know someone impacted by dementia.

With a growing ageing population, the number of Australians living with dementia may exceed 1 million by 2065. Here in Tasmania, it is estimated that more than 10,600 people are living with dementia. This place is a significant strain on our healthcare system and on the communities that support those living with dementia. In September, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare announced that dementia is now the leading cause of death for Australians. Dementia accounted for almost 17,400 deaths in 2023, equivalent to almost one in 10 of all deaths, further revealing the significant impact dementia has on the Australian and our Tasmanian community, which emphasises why gatherings like today's parliamentary friends event is so important.

The group builds on the theme of this year's Dementia Action Week, which was 'nobody can do it alone.' Thanks to my co-conveners and other members of parliament, along with representatives from Dementia Australia, for working with us to make the roundtable happen and to ensure that no one is alone. The roundtable provided the opportunity to bring together people living with dementia, family carers and Dementia Alliance members to discuss their experiences.

We explored practical examples of how all members of Tasmania's parliament can make a difference for their constituents across the state and commit to creating a dementia-friendly Tasmania. Dementia Australia will now draft an action plan to champion dementia messages throughout the parliamentary community. I encourage everyone to join us in creating dementia-friendly communities where people living with dementia can maintain social connections and live with dignity and respect.

In addition, one of our government's recent election policies is to provide a new training program to enhance dementia care across Tasmania. Working with Dementia Australia, the government will provide the training model D-Esc to staff across our four major hospitals and community nursing teams. D-Esc is a workshop that provides virtual reality training on de-escalating behavioural emergencies related to dementia. This innovative training will reduce the risks of harm for both the person living with dementia and our valued health staff, as well as improved personalised care and quality of life for patients and support for their loved ones.

In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank our local healthcare providers, support organisations, volunteers and carers, who work tirelessly to assist those living with dementia. Working together, please consider joining us in supporting the Parliamentary Friends of Dementia Action Plan to create dementia-friendly communities, including promoting education and research to reduce the risk of dementia. 


Caravan Parks - Long-Term Occupancy

[9.10 p.m.]
Mrs GREENE (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, for decades, caravan parks have quietly housed thousands of Tasmanians. They've been the safety net when rentals were tight and an option for people on fixed incomes or looking to downsize, and particularly elderly Tasmanians. Right now, those residents and the park owners who house them are in a legal grey zone. There is no clarity, no certainty, and no modern framework governing long-term occupancy. Decisions that affect people's homes and futures are being made under outdated laws that simply don't reflect reality. These residents live with uncertainty and some in my community have been living in fear. They live with the knowledge that the Tasmanian government has left them exposed without the legal protection, security, or planning framework that they deserve. I want to be really clear that this is not a sudden crisis. This is a crisis that the government has been warned about repeatedly and one they have consistently failed to act on.

Eighteen months ago, before I was a member of this place, I brought a motion to West Tamar Council calling on the Tasmanian government to urgently modernise the laws governing long-term residents in caravan parks. I was asking for them to be recognised properly under the Residential Tenancy Act, to provide clear protections and fair processes for these long-term park residents, and also to support park owners with a framework that actually reflects how parks operate in 2025, not 1985. Every single councillor around our table supported that motion, every single one, because we could all see what was happening. We could see that residents were living in limbo, and we could see parks that were trying to operate inside this legal grey zone, which was also very challenging for West Tamar Council at that moment in time. 

We knew that the Tasmanian government needed to step up. Eventually - finally - the Liberals announced a review and when they released the details, I noticed something pretty striking. The wording, the principles, and the commitments were almost identical to the motion that was passed by West Tamar Council - in parts, copied word for word. I didn't mind, I wasn't looking for credit, I was looking for progress. Today, progress is sadly what is missing because here we are more than 18 months later, and Tasmanians are still waiting. 

The government completed its review and held its consultations. It told residents and operators that legislative change was coming. What have we seen since? We've seen evictions, we've seen stress, and we've seen legal actions - it is still continuing to this very day. No bill before the parliament. What could have happened in this time was interim protections, but this government failed to do that too. There was no clarity for park owners and no security for residents.

The Attorney-General rose in parliament last sitting and said we should finally see a draft in early December. I hope that will happen this week and then it will go back out for community consultation again. That's more delay while some of Tasmania's most vulnerable people continue to live under the threat of displacement. 

The hardest part is that residents have heard all of this before from this government. Some of those opposite were more than happy to visit these caravan parks during the state election in 2024. They posed for photos. They put their arms around residents. They gave them promises that help was coming. What good is a promise if it's never delivered? These are not people with endless options. Many have lived in the same park for 10 or 15 or even 20 years. They've invested their own money into maintaining their homes, and they are part of the fabric of their local communities. Without legislative reform, they can still be told with very little notice that they must pack up everything they own and go. We know the reality of some of these homes: they can't be moved. So, they need to leave their property there. Their investment is gone. 

Park owners are also stuck. Most are small business operators trying to do the right thing, but they're left navigating outdated laws and carrying responsibility without clear guidance. Some of these people are very vulnerable, so it's no easy task. They deserve some certainty too. 

Other states have already done this work. Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland all have modern residential parks legislation. They've recognised the reality of long-term occupancy and built systems that protect residents and support operators. Tasmania will be the last state in the country to protect people's homes and that is not good enough. 

If the Liberals had acted when they said they would, we wouldn't be here today. Residents would have protections and owners would have the clarity that they need and this parliament would have the legislation in front of it. I hope that happens this week. People have waited long enough.


Rental Affordability

[9.15 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY(Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to talk about housing and a couple of recent reports that have been released. You only have to ask a renter to be told that finding an affordable place to live is getting harder and harder. The National Shelter SGS Economics and Planning Rental Affordability Index released in November only confirms it. They found that the affordability of renting in Greater Hobart has declined in the past year. Even average income earners are on the cusp of rental stress, with the median rent of $520 a week accounting for 28 per cent of renters' income. Even for a couple both earning minimum wage, rents are, I quote, 'Modestly unaffordable'. For low-income householders it's even worse. People on Job Seeker, pensions and single parents working part time are facing extremely or severely unaffordable rents.

This is a problem of the Liberal government's making. They simply haven't built enough houses in the last decade, and they have let Tasmania's homes be converted to Airbnbs at record rates. It's time they gave renters real rights and stopped unreasonable rent increases.

Rents are unaffordable around the rest of Tasmania as well. Things aren't much better in Launceston, Devonport and Burnie than in Hobart. If you want to find affordable rentals, it's pretty much a matter of moving to Queenstown or St Helens. It's simply not good enough. Housing is a human right, and we know that housing and secure housing leads to better school attendance, better productivity at work, better mental health and health outcomes.

Shelter Tasmania's acting CEO, Dr Lauren McGrow [OK], said that homelessness services are reporting that workers and families who have never struggled before are finding it difficult to find affordable housing. Unaffordable rents are causing people to skip meals, the cost of living and housing crisis is hitting Tasmanians hard, and the Liberals just simply aren't doing enough to help struggling Tasmanians.

They often talk about how things are getting better here than on the mainland, but it's simply not true anymore. According to SGS Economics and Planning senior associate, Kishan Ratnam [OK], and I quote:

Hobart renters are paying only 10 per cent less than their Melbourne counterparts, even though their incomes are 22 per cent lower.

While all areas are unaffordable in Hobart, in Melbourne and Sydney at least there are some areas which still remain affordable. The Liberals review of the Residential Tenancy Act is welcome, but struggling Tasmanians can't wait for action. We need some action now. 

On another report, SQM Research has said that Tasmanians are already struggling to find an affordable place to live, but many things are set to get worse again. That's according to this research which has predicted what life will be like for Hobart renters in a decade. In 10 years, they're predicting rents will rise by 6 per cent to10 per cent. For a median rental, that's a rise from $580 to $760 a week. That means Hobart renters might have to pay a staggering $40,000 a year just to keep a roof over their head. It's more than $9000 over what most renters are paying today.

The Liberals have sat on their hands for the last decade as rents have continued to rise. It's time they gave renters real rights before things get worse, and instead of focusing on a billion-dollar stadium, we should be making sure that Homes Tasmania is funded adequately to build the houses that Tasmanians need. We need to manage unaffordable rent increases; we need to end no-cause evictions, and make sure that the houses we do have meet minimum standards. With so many whole home rentals being stripped out of the rental market into short stay hotels, we need a way to regulate Airbnb. The 5 per cent short stay that the Liberals promised two elections ago, is now not set to be introduced until next year. Meanwhile, we're losing houses along the way. That really should be stepped up, and that would have helped with a $22 million injection into the budget.

Report after report is demonstrating that the housing stress and the housing challenge in Tasmania is getting worse. It's projected to get worse still. We have 5336 applicants on the priority housing register. In Estimates, we heard that many of them have one, two, three or even more children, so we know that that 5000-plus applications actually equals 8000 plus individual Tasmanians who are needing to find a home. 

We must do better for vulnerable Tasmanians. We must build more homes. We must give renters real rights because it is a human right to have a home to call your own and we are currently dismally failing Tasmanians.


Emergency Services National Medal Presentation Ceremony

[9.20 p.m.]
Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Management) - Honourable Speaker, hundreds of hours of dedicated service to keeping the Tasmanian communities safe was recognised and acknowledged over the weekend in Penguin in the north-west. I rise tonight to acknowledge the dedication of our fire and emergency service personnel right across the north-west region who were recently recognised at that National Medal presentation ceremony held at the beautiful Penguin Surf Life Saving Club.

It was lovely to see Her Excellency, the Governor and, of course, Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner, Jeremy Smith AFSM, celebrating the commitment of these extraordinary Tasmanians who serve our community with courage and professionalism. The purpose of the National Medal is to honour those who've served in the Australian Police Forces, Australian Fire services, Australian Ambulance services, Protective Services, correctional services and emergency services. The National Medal is awarded for 15 years of diligent service protecting our community, a significant milestone that represents countless call outs, hours of training and moments of bravery that many of us will never see.

A large cohort that was recognised on Saturday, including individuals such as Michelle (Shelley) Marthick of Irish Town and Lyndon Young of Port Sorell, among many others with recent recipients demonstrating enduring dedication in their service to their communities. 

I also acknowledge those whose service has extended beyond the 15 years of recognition. Individuals such as Norman Berkery of Hellyer, Paul Dowling of Devonport, and Craig Stirling of Somerset, who received their First Class, marking 25 years of dedicated involvement in the Tasmanian Fire Service.

Importantly, some of Tasmania's longest serving career and volunteer firefighters were recognised. These are people who've given 30, 40 and 50 years of service. I want to particularly pay tribute to Garry Morse of Riana, Philip McCormack of Kimberley, and Russell Barker of Hellyer, who each reached major long service milestones that reflect their unwavering leadership within their communities.

A remarkable group have reached the rare benchmark of 50 years who are honoured, including Paul Bugg of Penguin - Buggy, I hope we didn't embarrass you too much over recent days but you are truly a much loved part of the Tasmanian Fire Service, and serving in an operational support brigade, I know how many firefighters are grateful for your commitment to them.

Morris Hill of Sprent, Anne McCormack of Kimberley, and the amazing Mark McDermott AFSM of Strahan, who has played such a huge role on the west coast. Their half-century of selflessness and community care is deserving of the highest admiration of this parliament. 

I also want to acknowledge and thank Devonport Brigade Operational Support Member, Richard Kostic, and Stowport Natone Brigade Volunteer Firefighter, Fiona Tustian AFSM, who among others both received their 30-year long service medal and certificates.

Our SES personnel were equally represented and recognised. People like Anthony Dick who has actually been critical to delivering the Tasmanian Government Radio Network and I've seen him in flood events and a range of other emergencies, stepping up to support our community, Harold Deverell, and 45 and 40 years respectively for those two gentlemen. Rose Mitchell and John Mitchell of Kentish, both marking 35 years, who stand as pillars of resilience and reliability in times of emergency and disaster, particularly in that flood prone community.

Behind every medal recipient is a partner, a family, an employer, and a community that supports them to step away to protect others. Their contribution deserves acknowledgement in this place as well. What strikes me most at National Medal ceremonies is not only the years of service, although those are great, but the sense of pride, humility and camaraderie that defines both TFS and SES personnel across the north-west and right across the state. These are Tasmanians who never seek recognition but who deeply deserve it. I ask the House to join me in congratulating every medal recipient from this year's National Medal Presentation Ceremony and thanking all TFS and SES members, whether career or volunteer, who continue to protect Tasmanians in their greatest moments of need. Our communities are safer, stronger and more resilient because of them.

Members - Hear, hear.

Raider's Guide - Tasmanian Greyhound

[9.25 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about the Raider's Guide and Gary and Greg Fahey in particular. They are two names that most members of this place would be unfamiliar with. Within the Tasmanian greyhound industry, they are two legends of the sport. For over 50 years they've loved, owned, trained and bred many wonderful greyhounds and none better than their late champion, Raider's Guide. Raider's Guide, winner of 41 out of his 79 starts during a sparkling racing career, was lightly raced and carefully managed throughout his career.

Trained by a Tasmanian Hall of Famer, Gary Fahey, Raider's Guide will go down as Tasmania's greatest ever stayer, produced here in the state. His resume included the Devonport Chase, Ronald McDonald Charity Cup, RL Foley Perpetual Stakes, Richard Stamford Perpetual Stakes, both Tasmanian sprint and distance finals and the winner of the Billy Grice Memorial, a touching race to win.

The lack of distance races in Tasmania, though, meant that its owners and trainers had to take the dog elsewhere across the country. A start in the Hume Cup held at the Meadows in Victoria and competing at the highest level, Raider's Guide had an impressive heat win followed by a gallant second in the cup final.

Raider's Guide was selected to compete in the invitation-only prestigious Rookie Rebel in Victoria along with another star Tasmanian greyhound Fast Minardi, a remarkable achievement for two of Tasmania's own-bred greyhounds that were selected for the event - groundbreaking for Tasmania.

Raider's Guide found the front early, and the Rookie Rebel, and won convincingly, claiming its first Group 1 victory. Winning the Tasmanian Distance Final by a massive 16 lengths, Raider's Guide was set a challenge for all winners in other states to go to the National Final being held in South Australia where, in the lead up to the National Title, unheralded interest was sought from all around the country, especially for the 'Tasmanian', as they called him. Come race time, Raider's Guide did what Raider's Guide did best, found the front and beat its rivals by eight lengths - a massive achievement and a second Group 1 win.

A stellar 2024 racing season saw the dog crowned Tasmanian Greyhound of the Year. Later on, he went to the Sandown Cup, found the front after 100 metres, held off its rivals, winning its third Group 1.

An invitation to Queensland was received. In a highly anticipated event saw Raider's Guide journey up to Queensland and in a highly competitive race he defeated his rivals to claim his first Group 2 title.

He then returned back to Tasmania, lazed around the yard for a few weeks before he was set to resume racing. In the final following week, tragedy struck, with Raider's Guide falling after suffering a bump resulting in a fracture to his cervical spine. The race night veterinary surgeon, Dr Kim Barrett attended within minutes, immediately arranging for a clinic to open after hours and transferring the dog there, where he was placed in an anaesthetised state in an induced coma for further treatment the next morning. Instructions are on record from the trainer. They say, 'Save our dog at any cost. We will sell our home.'

The next day, the X-rays were taken and sent off to the expert greyhound surgeon for evaluation, but tragically, Raider's Guide passed away after having a cardiopulmonary arrest whilst underneath the anesthetised state. Later that day, Tasracing issued a written press statement indicating that Raider's Guide had been euthanised. It was reported widely that way. This was not true. The owners and trainers have asked me to put this on record as it's been misreported here and elsewhere that he was euthanised. The Fahey family loved that dog like their own family member. The idea that they would have just euthanised this dog has been emotionally distressful for the Fahey family who had just lost not only their best ever greyhound, but a loved family member that they'll never forget. No one ever picked up the phone to find out the exact circumstances. Whatever happened to the ethical conduct that they should have received? A complete veterinary report was available, but no one bothered to check it. Maybe the truth wasn't what people wanted to hear. 

Distraught, the family tell me they phoned and expressed their distaste to many people but the media coverage continued. They suffered. The 82-year old trainer was traumatised and heartbroken and had to be hospitalised himself, such was the grief and stress and suffering that he experienced following the death of his loved dog and family member but also the media coverage following that. 

The Fahey family are just one of hundreds of families who love their dogs and greyhound racing in this state. They would do anything for that dog and they would have sold their home for that dog. It wasn't euthanized for the sake of it. The dog died tragically and they will never forget a great Tasmanian athlete, bred, trained and owned by a wonderful Tasmanian greyhound family.

The House adjourned at 9.30 p.m.
