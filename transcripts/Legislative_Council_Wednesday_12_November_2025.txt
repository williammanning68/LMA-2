Mr PRESIDENT - Honourable members, before I call on orders of the day I welcome to our Chamber this morning year 9 students from The Hutchins School, the first group from the school that is touring through parliament today.

We've just been through the formal business of the Council, where we open the session, and that's a set thing. We will go on to orders of the day. You may have heard that we've had a recent interim Budget. The honourable members of th [Bookmark: Phr10_O=140.7_D=25.2_C=0.85] e Legislative Council will have the opportunity to express their thoughts and concerns with the Budget. If we get through that, we will go on to other bills that we have listed for the rest of the day.

Thank you for having an interest in our parliament. We hope you have an enjoyable time. I'm sure all the members of the Legislative Council will make you very welcome.

Members - Hear, hear.


MOTION

Noting - Budget Papers 2025-26 and Appropriation Bills (No. 1 and No. 2)

Continued from 11 November 2025 (page 76).

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=169.0_D=3.7_C=0.59] [11.07 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=173.1_D=10.8_C=0.75] Ms FORREST (Murchison) -  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=195.8_D=24.3_C=0.75] Mr President, when the Treasurer, Mr Eric Abetz, rose to deliver the 2025-26 state Budget on 6 November, his opening line promised brightness and optimism. He said Tasmania's future continues to be bright, setting a tone of confidence and realistic optimism about the state's fiscal trajectory. By the time he sat down, he delivered something quite different [Bookmark: Phr14_O=220.6_D=4.4_C=0.84] : a budget built on accounting tricks, unrealistic assumptions about revenue growth [Bookmark: Phr15_O=225.6_D=3.1_C=0.91] , workforce reductions and wage increases [Bookmark: Phr16_O=229.7_D=10.0_C=0.74] , partially-funded initiatives that will also certainly require future supplementary appropriations, and the fundamental misrepresentation of Tasmania's true fiscal position.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=240.4_D=6.8_C=0.82] This isn't spin meeting reality; it's fantasy economics colliding with an inevitable catastrophe. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=248.2_D=9.1_C=0.85]  The numbers in this Budget simply don't add up. They're carefully constructed not to add up until after either the next election or the next budget [Bookmark: Phr19_O=258.4_D=8.1_C=0.83] , when the bill for today's magical thinking becomes due and becomes someone else's priority - or problem - to manage. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=267.2_D=14.0_C=0.81]  I will contain my comments here today to the state of the Budget and our fiscal position. I will not comment on specific areas related to matters of health, education, public safety, justice, or all the other critical areas of service delivery specifically [Bookmark: Phr21_O=281.6_D=10.8_C=0.79] , as I will have an opportunity to do that next week. I will focus entirely on the Budget itself and make no apologies for the length of my contribution, such is the seriousness of the situation we are in.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=293.0_D=12.0_C=0.76] The Treasurer referred to this Budget as an interim Budget, suggesting a compressed timeline meant that little or any real action could be taken. I commend the member for Huon on his contribution yesterday; it was very thorough. He also went back down a little bit of history. I'm going to join him on the path of history.

The election of 29 August 1998 led to a change in government, and David Crean became treasurer. Mr Crean, as a new treasurer in a new government, had exactly the amount of time that was available to this government to repair a budget. He didn't have the advantages of all the work done previously by Treasury to prepare the May budget. He's had to start from scratch. If you want to go back and look at history, he delivered a full set of budget papers, a lot of other information as well, and a commitment to real change.

Mr Crean delivered his budget on 5 November, after the 29 August election. Admittedly, there wasn't a period of uncertainty and extended caretaker period of that time, but when you take out that period when the government was actually installed in this year, the time was 10 weeks: the same. So the government, as I said, has had the benefit of developing the previous May budget and the consultation that went into that. The excuses for a lack of attention to addressing the budget crisis we now face ring very hollow.

This is not a responsible, forward-looking Budget as suggested by the Leader on behalf of the government; there is no clear recognition of the problem, and the statement that the government continues to commit to delivering infrastructure denies the reality of what the budget papers actually reveal. Both major credit rating agencies, Moody's and Standard and Poor's (S&P), have already downgraded Tasmania's outlook to negative since the 2024-25 budget. They're looking at the same numbers the government has and reaching a very different conclusion about the state's fiscal trajectory.

When independent financial analysts see warning signs, but the Treasurer sees brightness and optimism, someone's reading the wrong dashboard. Another matter credit agencies would consider is the general government net debt, plus superannuation liability, in nominal terms as a percentage of gross state product. Members who were here when the 2022-23 Budget was delivered will recall there was a chart included in the assets and liabilities section for the first time, which compared the general government sector net debt plus superannuation liability as a percentage of gross state product across jurisdictions.

The same chart, and I'm glad they haven't pulled it out of this year's Budget, is on page 180 of budget paper 1. In the first chart in 2022-23, it was estimated that at 30 June 2023, Tasmania's ratio would be 27.8 per cent. It was emphasised by the government that this was lower than that terrible state, Victoria, at 29.9 per cent. Fast forward just two years, and this year's budget paper estimates that at 30 June 2026 the Tasmanian ratio would increase to 32 per cent and Victoria will have fallen to 27.8 per cent. 

So we have gone from being just a little bit better than Victoria to over 4 per cent worse than Victoria in just three years. For those who want to also rely on the appearance that we may not be as bad as the Australian Capital Territory, this is a comparison that cannot be directly made. As Saul Eslake points out when he's commented extensively on this matter:

The ACT superannuation liabilities aren't as large as they appear in government finance statistics, because its employee superannuation arrangements are managed by the Commonwealth Government Superannuation Fund, which precludes the ACT from including capital gains on its superannuation investments in its GFS financial statements, as other states and the Northern Territory do.

So while we're still below the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory, the next-worst state after Victoria is South Australia, which is not as bad as us, way down at 19.2 per cent. What we are seeing is the pea-and-thimble trick or a shell game on full display. Let's start with how the government manufactured the wafer-thin surplus that appears in the final year of the forward Estimates. The Budget shows a net operating balance surplus of just $5.6 million in 2028-29: barely material in a budget of over $10 billion, but politically crucial because it allows the government to claim their return to surplus. This is absolutely illusionary and delusional.
The member for Huon touched on this in his contribution - we can't overlook the fact that despite its widespread use, the net operating balance is a very incomplete measure of the budget's bottom line, because as I have often pointed out, it excludes capital expenditures, whilst it includes as revenue grants from the federal government for capital purposes. We can look to the underlying net operating balance, which I'm glad the government continues to include, which excludes one-off grants from the federal government for capital purposes, to get a more accurate picture. This more meaningful measure will be in deficit by a total of $3.8 billion over the next four years. Compared with a total of $4.2 billion projected in the May Budget, that failed to pass the parliament.

That reality aside, if you look at how these delusional claims of an almost surplus in four years, we must consider the numbers and tricks that have fed into this picture. First, the Treasurer's Reserve has been reduced from $50 million to $25 million in 2025-26, then down to just $20 million in the forward Estimates. For context, the actual expenditure from the Treasurer's Reserve in 2024-25 was $40 million, they've reduced it to $25 million. It was $40 million last year. This reserve exists precisely to cover unforeseen circumstances, urgent needs and the inevitable cost pressures that arise during any financial year. It is the fiscal equivalent of your emergency fund. This action doesn't reduce government costs. I will let that sink in. This reduction in the appropriation to the Treasurer's Reserve does not reduce costs. It removes the appropriation of those costs. that are inevitably going to arise. It is like cancelling your home insurance and claiming you've reduced household expenditure. Your house doesn't become less likely to burn down because you've saved the premium.

Also largely absent, are many of the government's election commitments. With commentary suggesting that these will be considered in the next budget. The members for Elwick and Pembroke both spoke about this. I am not sure how many people and organisations who are the expected recipients of these election commitments feel, considering that many of those casting their votes actually did believe the government will deliver on these promises. Shameful.

The government has completely backed away and fundamentally changed their position, a so-called rock-solid guarantee to organisations and others, to see their trust in the government completely shattered. Why would we believe them now when this budget is in such terrible shape? Here's what will happen next: following the overwhelming pattern of recent history, agencies will face urgent cost pressures. Ministers will make promises of funding later in the year, when circumstances require it. Agencies will spend money they don't have, which is technically a breach of the Financial Management Act. Before June 2026 arrives, we will see a supplementary appropriation bill that restores much of what was notionally 'saved'. I say saved in inverted commas there.

Secondly, an even more egregiously, the Budget includes unallocated budget efficiency measures that exist only on paper. The May budget that never passed, had at least the honesty to attract a specific figure to these measures, $150 million in annual savings from the Efficiency and Productivity Unit, but there's no indication of how much was actually saved in the 2023-24 and the 2024-25 years. That's a question for Estimates, no doubt.
Details related to this, $150 million in savings is buried now in Finance-General, and it gets a mention on pages 72 and 76 of Budget Paper 2, Vol. 1. There is a bit of commentary in chapter 1, Budget Paper 1, but what is very interesting about the description now for these efficiency measures is that they've been allocated to other expenses, rather than employee expenses to try and suggest that they're not going to cut employees, or any of the other normal expenditure areas. It sits under 'other'. I suspect this has been done to enable the government to suggest that the savings aren't about jobs. The comment on page 72 is that: (OK)

These savings will be delivered by investing in technology and adopting better management practices, including via opportunities identified through program and initiative evaluations.

That's from page 72 on Budget Paper 2, Volume 1. This, obviously, provides zero confidence. It is a well-proven fact that investing in technology is very expensive, takes much longer than ever initially expected and delivers savings of much lower magnitude than originally claimed or expected. You only have to look at some of the IT rollouts we've had with government businesses over the years.

If it doesn't end up actually costing you more in the end, what remains are reduced appropriations, money simply not allocated in the budget, not cost savings, with no identified programs being cut, no specific reforms being implemented and no actual services being reduced.

The budget papers admit these measures are modest in dollar terms and symbolic. When you're running an underlying operating deficit of $1.4 billion, symbolic savings are about as useless as bailing out the Titanic with a teaspoon.

Both of these measures have been taken from the manual, how to put lipstick on a pig. It's been a frequent source of budget papers and election pitches.

The savings in the Liberal plan for a 'brighter future' in 2013-14, for instance, almost entirely comprised savings from a more efficient public service of $155 million and cutting the Treasurer's Reserve, $40 million. History repeats itself. First is a tragedy maybe, then, unfortunately, it is an absolute farce.

If the Treasurer would have a closer look at the handbook covering lipstick application, he will notice a strategic action plan which the Labor government used to pretend it set aside money to pay future superannuation, but because there wasn't enough cash they had to borrow back what wasn't there to balance the books. And they tend to go back to this often, Mr President, saying look over there.

It looked to some as if it had been borrowed and spent, but in reality, it wasn't there in the first place. The essential point here is that just because an appropriation bill allows for something, doesn't mean it will occur.

The Liberals don't bother setting aside any superannuation for current defined benefits members either so, they've they've continued the same sin of the terrible Labor party back then, and they don't even make the mandatory 12 per cent Superannuation Guarantee Levy.

Since 2014, at least a billion dollars in Super Guarantee amounts for defined benefits employees has been spent elsewhere. But someone troubled by future generations having to pay for the sins and omissions of their forebears, this is no doubt keeping the Treasurer awake at night.

These aren't savings. They're unfunded liabilities disguised as fiscal discipline. They're line items showing reduced items without any corresponding reduction in what the government is expecting to do. The 'surplus' in 202829 exists only because the government has not appropriated money for things agencies will need to do to deliver the services Tasmanian's need and deserve. It's not a surplus; it's an unfunded liability with a bow on it.

We have seen this movie before. Every year, the government presents forward Estimates showing discipline and restraint. Every year, reality intrudes, and supplementary appropriations follow. The actual outcome bears little resemblance to what was actually budgeted. This pattern is so well established, that building a budget on the assumption that it will somehow work this time is either extraordinary optimism or deliberate deception. The ending doesn't change just because you've renamed the sequel.

Even focusing on the accounting tricks, the general government sector understates the fundamental problem because the reader is being encouraged to only look at part of the picture. The Treasurer focused relentlessly on general government debt, reaching $10.4 billion by June 2029. What he characterised as 'peak debt' - I put that in inverted commas because it's not a term I'm familiar with - the point, apparently, at which debt stops growing and repayment can theoretically begin. This figure dominates the budget speech and the public commentary. It's designed to.

What the Treasurer conspicuously doesn't mention is the total public non-financial corporations, the PNFCs, or the government businesses, including Hydro Tasmania, TasNetworks, TasPorts, TT-Line and others. These aren't separate from the government; they're wholly owned by it.

Their debts are guaranteed by the state, as we've seen very clearly with a recent commitment to underwrite more debt for TT-Line. They're capital injections to TT-Line and others come from the general government. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=9.2_D=19.7_C=0.81]  Their dividends return to general government. The relationship is highly interdependent. Equity injections flow from general government to the PNFCs, while dividends and income tax equivalents flow back. You cannot sensibly assess the state's fiscal position by looking just at one side of the ledger. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=32.4_D=10.2_C=0.68]  An analogy that could be used is like looking at your household financial position, by looking at the mortgage but ignoring credit cards and car loans because they're technically separate.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=44.6_D=15.0_C=0.82] When you look at the whole picture - the only honest and prudent way to assess government finances - the numbers become terrifying. The PNFC borrowings increased by $9 billion over the Budget year and forward Estimates. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=59.9_D=14.6_C=0.70]  Even in 2028-29, which the Treasurer claims is 'peak debt' for the general government, PNFC borrowings increase by a further $2 billion. That's in the year that we're supposed to be in peak debt.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=75.8_D=11.3_C=0.76] To read that again, in the year that the Treasurer says the general government reaches peak debt and can start paying it down, the government businesses are still borrowing an additional $2 billion. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=88.0_D=9.7_C=0.80]  So, the Treasurer focused on the general government debt hitting $10 billion, while carefully not mentioning the total government debt, the complete picture, is heading toward $20 billion. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=99.0_D=6.2_C=0.66]  That's not peak debt, whatever that is, that's Mount Everest Base Camp, and we're still climbing.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=109.0_D=6.7_C=0.74] You cannot pay down debt while you're still accumulating it. This is not a controversial economic proposition, it's basic maths. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=116.3_D=7.0_C=0.75]  The government's own cash flow statement shows net borrowings of $734.8 million in 2028-29, s [Bookmark: Phr12_O=124.4_D=11.6_C=0.76] o how does the Treasurer dream about starting to pay down debt in 2028-29 when his own numbers show net borrowing of $734 million that year? [Bookmark: Phr13_O=137.4_D=7.5_C=0.67]  How does he reconcile the claim peak debt with a reality that the PNFC borrowing continues growing by $2 billion? [Bookmark: Phr14_O=145.6_D=9.0_C=0.86]  The answer is simple. He doesn't. He's counting on most people not digging this deep into the numbers and hoping the contradiction won't become obvious until it's politically too late to matter.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=155.4_D=14.9_C=0.81] This assumes that all the Budget's assumptions about wage growth, FTE reductions, capital expenditure coming in on budget are actually met. Spoiler alert, they won't be, which means even these alarming numbers are likely optimistic. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=171.6_D=13.3_C=0.79]  This is just one very real risk. There are other risks here, too many to outline. On Budget Paper No. 1 pages 74 to 77 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=185.9_D=16.0_C=0.77]  and I'm sure members would have read the risks and sensitivities chapter there. These risks are a big part of the Treasurer's analysis. Once again, their potential impact on budget Estimates is overwhelmingly negative and massively exceeding any $5 million estimated surplus [Bookmark: Phr18_O=202.6_D=3.6_C=0.79]  which is a deception none of us believe.  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=207.3_D=1.6_C=0.93] But don't just believe me. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=209.4_D=8.8_C=0.83]  Believe the numbers. The numbers are there for all to see and show the problem was not spending during COVID. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=219.8_D=7.0_C=0.82]  It was the spending like drunken sailors by this government since 2021-22. [Bookmark: Phr22_O=228.0_D=3.4_C=0.90]  The numbers tell us a different story and tell us the truth.

 [Bookmark: Phr23_O=232.3_D=29.7_C=0.80] If we delve into the $5.6 million surplus in 2028-29, this is obviously completely contrived to be able to point to the surplus to justify the glide path suggested by the Treasurer. When comparing the net operating balance forward Estimates that have been in each budget and revised estimates since 2020-21, I went back that far because that's when COVID impact started [Bookmark: Phr24_O=262.4_D=5.8_C=0.76] , and I think the member for Huon also did address some of these points as well.  [Bookmark: Phr25_O=269.2_D=5.4_C=0.81] I started at 2020-21 to take out the immediate impact of COVID there. [Bookmark: Phr26_O=276.8_D=12.4_C=0.76]  It's crystal clear when you do that, that the forward Estimates for each year changed in each of these documents. That's looking at the Budget and the revised Estimates report. [Bookmark: Phr27_O=290.3_D=14.7_C=0.84]  If we compare those various figures with what was the actual result for the year, one interesting thing becomes apparent. Between 2020 and 2021 and between 2024 and 2025, the government has produced Estimates on 13 occasions that 13 net operating balance surpluses will be achieved. That's what they predicted, but not one has actually been achieved, not one surplus.

The government has also estimated over that period the achievement of a net operating balance services on four occasions, for either 2025-26 like this year we're looking at with the Budget now, or 2026-27. That's in those previous estimates, that's what they were saying was going to be the year of surplus. So, this year's budget and next year, but this year's Budget is now estimating massive deficits each year. We've gone from a prediction of surpluses to massive deficit. Their track record would suggest that a surplus doesn't even noticeably show in these numbers has any chance of being achieved if you go on the recent history.

Budgets were passed by Parliament repeatedly with those assumptions, all of which proved to be a fallacy. Why would we believe the Treasurer this time, when so many committed projects have been delayed or reprofiled, disappear completely or deferred, and we have a proposed stadium in the mix that we don't have any surety of full costings for the stadium and the related infrastructure? How can we believe that that's likely to be the case. when every other year since 2021-22 has shown different?

Ms Webb - It is the definition of insanity, isn't it?

Ms FORREST - I've been saying this for a while, I might say. 

What is also interesting and a matter I've raised a number of times, more recently, is that over the major COVID years, 2020-21 and 2021-22, the actual deficits ended up being a lot lower than were expected, which effectively means during those years we actually spent within our Budget pretty much. Yes, there was a top-up. There was additional appropriation made because we knew that there were additional costs that need to be met. But if you look at the figures, it shows some level of fiscal constraint despite the challenges by being funded appropriately to deliver the services that were needed. Even in 2022-23, while the outcome wasn't the surplus originally expected to be achieved, it wasn't as bad as what had been expected at the beginning of the year.

To use the excuse that this is COVID, is a fallacy. This position of restraint and almost meeting your targets or your expected net operating balance results, completely changes in 2023-24 and 2024-25. As late as the 2022-23 Revised Estimates Report, decent surplus for these years were being expected, presumed on the basis of the view that COVID support would be wound back or hadn't been as dramatic as expected. But no, what we saw was the refusal of the government to act. Two early elections, at least two of them, including the 2024 election, adding $1.4 billion to the tab, increased spending and thus a dramatic deterioration in the net operating balance deficit, estimates that occurred from 2023-24 Budget onwards.

It's the government who failed to listen to take into account the need to pull things in. 'Just keep spending, it'll be fine'. The stark reality from the government's own numbers surely put paid to the whole argument the Treasurer has tried to resuscitate around blaming COVID. It is action taken by the government in 2023-24 onwards that has driven the recent dramatic deterioration. Let's also not overlook the fact that less than half a year ago Treasury released a document required once an election is called, to consider the need for a pre-election financial outlook. It's not automatic, it doesn't doesn't automatically get released. It's a matter for Treasury.

This year Treasury deemed it was necessary, and they actually needed to go back to the 2024-25 Budget to do the work, and it does contain historical trends, as a revised Estimates report of February 2025 - and I was very annoyed by this as well - had omitted a large portion of the required health expenditure in the forward Estimates. So the revised Estimates report is a Treasurer's document. The Pre-election Financial Outlook (PFO) is a Treasury document. There's an important distinction here because in the Revised Estimates Report the claim was by the then Treasurer - not the Treasurer now, probably for obvious reasons - that he decided he couldn't quantify the amount of extra health funding that would be needed, despite the fact that they had to put it in for that year, because it had to be found.

Ms Thomas - We've had three treasurers in three years, haven't we?

Ms FORREST - Yes, we have. That was treasurer Barnett, at least I believe it was.

Mr Gaffney - Yes.

Ms FORREST - One of the previous treasurers: there's been a bit of a turnover.

As I said, the PEFO is a Treasury document that provides Treasury with the opportunity to prepare its figures without the interference of the treasurer or the government. The PEFO was estimating that in 2027-28 the net operating balance would be a deficit of $2.209 billion. Now, in this Budget with the Treasurer's name on it, the 2027-28 forward Estimates is 'only' a net operating deficit of $293 million: a magical improvement of over $1.9 billion.

Not only that, in 2028-29, the year after Treasury estimated the net operating balance deficit of $2.209 billion in their PEFO, the Treasurer is estimating that they will achieve a net operating balance surplus of around $5 million. You can see why I'm sceptical. The difference in the budget Estimates being prepared by Treasury and the Treasurer would be laughable, if it was not so serious for Tasmania as a whole and the Tasmanian community. In addition, Tasmania's economic growth for 2024-25, the year we've just completed, had been revised down to 0 per cent. Not slow growth: no growth, zero. 

International exports, which the Treasurer celebrates as a cornerstone of Tasmania's prosperity, declined by 4.4 per cent in 2024-25. The forecast for 2025-26 is just 1 per cent growth, well below our historic average and below the national rate. That's all in Budget Paper 1. The strongest-growing state economy that we once were, has stalled on this government's watch. Yet, the budget speech devotes barely a paragraph to acknowledging this fundamental shift, before pivoting back to celebrating past achievements and trumpeting the unemployment rate, which is commendable but not the full picture, and blaming everyone else. 

In this environment of stalled growth and declining exports, you would expect a reasonable government to examine every available lever to improve the fiscal position. That means looking harder both sides of the ledger, cutting wasteful expenditure - actual cuts, not appropriation tricks - and examining revenue options. You would be wrong, however; this Budget contains no policy changes to increase revenue. None. Not one.

Despite the fact that the Commonwealth Grants Commission assessments of Tasmania's revenue base suggest that we're not raising the revenue we should be from our available tax bases, this government has made a political decision that touching revenue is completely off-limits. How can we expect the federal government to help, if we're not helping ourselves? The Treasurer devotes significant time in his budget speech to blaming Canberra for a $673 million health funding shortfall, demanding that the Commonwealth increase its contribution to 45 per cent, as agreed by the National Cabinet. Of course they should and that is a legitimate grievance. 

However, when the Commonwealth Grants Commission, the independent umpire of fiscal capacity, indicates through its assessment that Tasmania isn't fully utilising its revenue-raising capacity, the 'blame Canberra' strategy becomes a little bit harder to sustain. Are we raising the revenue we should, according to the Commonwealth Grants Commission assessment of our revenue base? If not, complaints about neglect by the Australian Government in Canberra ring hollow.

The growth in own-source revenue which underpins the Budget's optimistic forward estimates projection is highly dependent on presumed, strong growth and returns from Hydro Tasmania and TasNetworks, who have always been quite reliable in providing money to the state, I might add. This dependency is not just problematic; it's fantasy economics. Consider Hydro Tasmania: I've documented extensively the utility's 96 per cent profit collapse. Is this just one bad year? Maybe. I doubt it. On top of that, we now learn that the fundamental business case that justified massive investments seems to have been turned on its head. As bad as the 2024-25 results were for Hydro Tasmania, it would have been much worse without Basslink operating as an unregulated asset, because the plan is to regulate it. 

The dam levels were higher because there were higher imports; Hydro were preserving their water. That's not a bad decision to make, I'm just saying that's how it happens, but because Hydro Tasmania had a contractual arrangement with Basslink's owner, APA, they paid a fee for the return of interregional revenues. That's how the system works at the moment until it's regulated: because of the very high imports this year, Hydro Tasmania made money. 

They made money from the interregional revenues, but next time when there's a drought and the rainfall patterns don't live up to expectations, which is highly likely because the process is on foot now, Basslink will be a regulated asset, and consumers will be footing the bill and Hydro Tasmania won't be receiving the interregional revenues, so it will be worse off. In addition, just last week Hydro Tasmania's CEO was speaking at a conference about Marinus Link and told Renew Energy, as reported by Renew Energy, 'Forget making money off it. It will be there to provide energy security.'

Let that sink in, because the $3.5 billion project Marinus Link project, central to the government's energy and economic strategy, is now apparently described by the Hydro CEO as not being about making money, when previously this was to be all about making super profits with which Hydro could then offset the large increases in transmission costs for consumers. While there's an opportunity in a couple of weeks to ask this more fully to see if it was reported somewhat out of context, this comment represents a complete turnaround from what we were told when the project was being sold to Tasmanians, and how the whole-of-state business case was reliant on these significant returns from Hydro Tasmania. 

Then Marinus was going to generate revenues, support dividends, underwrite Tasmania's fiscal position; now we're told it's a drought-mitigation strategy, not a revenue-raising plan. We should all be concerned about that. If Hydro can't generate the dividend income the Budget assumes, and if TasNetworks faces similar constraints on its revenue-generating capacity, then the revenue projections underpinning the forward Estimates collapse like a house of cards.

The government knows this. Treasury knows this. They're banking on it not becoming that obvious to the broader public, possibly until sometime later, at which point revised forward Estimates will quietly acknowledge that that mathematical inevitability occurred. The Budget's expenditure projections assume a reduction in state service employees of around 2800 full-time-equivalent positions over the forward Estimates through vacancy control and natural attrition.

This is presented as achievable through the hiring freeze announced on 2 March 2025, which restricted recruitment of non-essential positions. I still find it incredible that we're employing non-essential people. Anyway, anyone with experience in public-sector workforce management knows this number is not achievable through attrition alone:  not in the timeframes contemplated in the Budget, not without fundamental scaling back of service delivery in ways the government isn't acknowledging, and not without significant redundancy cost. You just can't do it in the timeframe they're suggesting.

Natural attrition in the Tasmanian State Service typically runs around 5 per cent to 7 per cent annually, depending on the agency and age profile of the workforce. Even at the higher end, achieving a reduction of 2800 FTE through attrition alone would require years, not the timeframe in the forward Estimates, and that assumes you can leave every departed position unfilled, which is feasible only if you're simultaneously cutting service levels - something the Budget explicitly claims it isn't doing.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=8.7_D=8.8_C=0.72] Getting anywhere near the 2800 FT reductions in the Budget's timeframe will require compulsory redundancies on a scale not seen in Tasmania for decades. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=18.6_D=1.8_C=0.82]  Where's the funding for the redundancies? [Bookmark: Phr4_O=21.9_D=1.1_C=0.85]  It's not in the Budget. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=23.8_D=8.7_C=0.65]  Redundancies cost money, often significant money when you factor in accumulated leaving entitlements, notice periods, redundancy payments themselves. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=33.1_D=5.0_C=0.70]  These payments can create havoc and a massive impact on the cash flow statement. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=39.0_D=5.2_C=0.76]  You can't cut 2800 positions through attrition when there's no funding for redundancies.
 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=46.5_D=4.8_C=0.72] 
Then you when you factor in the significant underfunding of wage increases [Bookmark: Phr9_O=51.9_D=6.7_C=0.75] , the problem becomes even more acute. The Budget assumes wage growth of 2.5 per cent across the forward Estimates. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=59.6_D=13.7_C=0.72]  Current wage pressures, inflation dynamics and the outcomes of wage negotiations and other jurisdictions, and in Tasmania, where most of the workers have been offered a 3 per cent increase, which blows the figure right out of the water immediately [Bookmark: Phr11_O=74.0_D=2.4_C=0.66] , suggests this figure is unrealistically low. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=77.4_D=3.9_C=0.71]  If actual wage outcomes a 0.5 per cent higher [Bookmark: Phr13_O=82.0_D=14.3_C=0.84]  at 3 per cent rather than 2.5 per cent, the gap in expenditure projections widens further and adds up to millions of dollars.

To accommodate higher than budgeted wage outcomes within the expenditure envelope, even more positions would need to go. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=97.9_D=9.6_C=0.79]  The real number of FTEs required to hit the expenditure targets could be as high as 3500 to 4000 or more, and still, there's no funding for redundancies [Bookmark: Phr15_O=109.5_D=2.8_C=0.87] . This is another unfunded liability waiting to explode. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=113.0_D=12.0_C=0.79]  The cost of redundancies also includes an increase in the cost of general government unfunded superannuation contributions for redundant employees who commence their defined benefits pensions and there would be a number of those.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=127.6_D=19.7_C=0.77] If such employees are replaced by other employees in slightly different roles perhaps for whom the government has to set aside contributions every month, as they do for all but the defined benefits employees, then the general government cash flows will be worse rather than show any improvement.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=148.1_D=25.0_C=0.79] Either the government will fail to achieve the workforce reductions, blowing the expenditure targets and requiring supplementary appropriations, or they'll have to find hundreds of millions for redundancy costs that aren't budgeted. This will also blow the expenditure targets and requiring supplementary appropriations, or they'll have to cut services in a way that haven't been acknowledged, generating political backlash and likely supplementary appropriations to restore them. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=174.3_D=9.0_C=0.73]  There's no way through this particular thicket that doesn't end in a supplementary appropriation bill and a revised forward Estimate, admitting the original projections were never realistic.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=184.3_D=6.8_C=0.76] We dig into the policy and parameters statement, which is one of my first parts of the Budget paper I go to. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=192.7_D=14.8_C=0.72]  The detailed breakdown of new initiatives and their funding profiles, you'll discover further concerns. Some initiatives, the one we will presume will be required as an ongoing cost, some are only funded for two years of a four year forward Estimates period. [Bookmark: Phr22_O=208.2_D=2.6_C=0.79]  This creates a risk of program continuity. [Bookmark: Phr23_O=211.3_D=3.4_C=0.74]  One example is police worn body cameras. They provide bit of an instructive example. This is a law-and-order initiative. The government will certainly tout us as evidence of being tough on crime and supporting our police. Rightly so, t [Bookmark: Phr25_O=225.6_D=6.6_C=0.80] hey should support our police. The funding runs for two years then stops halfway through the forward Estimates. [Bookmark: Phr26_O=232.8_D=3.6_C=0.66]  Won't the new recruits come into service need their own body worn cameras? [Bookmark: Phr27_O=237.5_D=1.2_C=0.63]  We are going to have to share them. [Bookmark: Phr28_O=240.3_D=8.6_C=0.77]  Won't some in service, currently require replacing? We know that police unfortunately don't always have simple interactions with people.

 [Bookmark: Phr29_O=249.6_D=10.8_C=0.80] What happens in year 3? Does the program end? It would be politically unacceptable not to equip our new police officers with body worn cameras, surely the funding will have to continue [Bookmark: Phr30_O=261.1_D=9.9_C=0.77] , which means one of two things. Either program costs aren't included in the out years of the forward Estimates, making the Estimates understated, or the funding will magically appear later. [Bookmark: Phr31_O=272.8_D=2.5_C=0.51]  I am not making it up. It is all in there. [Bookmark: Phr32_O=276.2_D=11.2_C=0.81] 

Either way, the forward Estimates presented as they are, are fiction. They show expenditure restraint that cannot and will not be sustained. When the rubber meets the road of actual service delivery and political reality, we're going to see a very different picture. The pattern repeats across multiple initiatives with programs announced with fanfare and initial funding, but with ongoing costs carefully excluded from the later years of the forward Estimates to make the fiscal position look more sustainable. It's a trick as old as budgeting itself but rarely executed with quite this much pizazz across quite so many line items.

The exclusion of additional equity injections that will be required to keep TT-Line afloat, no pun intended, and able to meet to meet the going concern requirements of the auditor, are likely to be around $70 million is a case in point. Not there. Yes, they're looking at their projection or how they can fix their financial position, but it's pretty clear to everyone, except perhaps a small number in the government, who think this is not going to be needed.

There is no real visibility or even a footnote in Finance-General to indicate that this equity injection of $74.5 million bailout to TT-Line, surely an increase of $210 million in support for government businesses would require a footnote and not just look at Budget Paper 1 to find out more, which is exactly what it said. Then you had to go hunting through Budget Paper 1 to find the relevant information about that. But when reading Budget Paper 1, it clearly states: (tbc 11.51)

The review that is being undertaken by TT-Line in their longer-term strategy will consider the need for further funding support that might be needed from the government.

This would be as close as a sure thing as you'd find they'll need further assistance.

Similarly, comparing capital expenditure tables and agency level between the 2024-25 Budget and this 2025-26 Budget reveals numerous projects deferred in the forward Estimates.

Major infrastructure investments that appeared in outer in the out years of last year's. forward Estimates have quietly been pushed beyond the current planning horizon, and they go to the member for Huon's horizon situation. That's where they've gone. So yes, that's why you can't see them, they're over the horizon.

It appears most if not all capital expenditure that has been promised but not commenced has been deferred at least by a year. You can easily see that by looking at last year's budget papers and then looking at this year's budget papers.

This is very evident CapEx for schools in particular with one- or two-year delays on builds already committed to. If you want to look in the education area, that's where you'll see the biggest shifts pushing it out, most of them by one, some of them by two years before commencement.

Others appear to reveal significant cost blowouts, but it's a bit hard to tell as the estimated total budget costs had gone missing until I discovered they're all over in Budget Paper 2 in the relevance section there.

I mean, it doesn't mean they're not there, it just means you've got to know where else to go looking to find them.

Mr President, other capital investment commitments that appeared in last year's budget paper seemed to have gone missing entirely, albeit quietly, perhaps been canned. These projects allegedly aren't cancelled; they simply move off the visible books.

When they inevitably return, which I mean the government does bring them back, resuscitate them because the infrastructure needs, they were meant to address actually haven't disappeared, they'll come with a construction cost escalations. As we know, Mr President, delaying capital projects during an inflationary period always increases their ultimate cost, renewed borrowing requirements and the same fiscal pressures we face today, probably worse.

The government calls this 'reprofiling' infrastructure to align with delivery capacity. The budget papers are more honest about the motivation and say it's to reduce short term debt pressures. At least the budget papers are honest about that.

In plain English, we're cutting and deferring capital works because we can't afford them. But according to the Treasurer, we can absolutely afford the $1.3 billion stadium with a cost benefit ratio of 0.5 if we're optimistic.

I'm not saying this is about the Budget, not about the stadium. That's the arguments being put.

This creates a false economy in multiple ways.

Tasmania needs productive infrastructure investment to drive economic growth, particularly in a period of weak private sector investment. Cutting public capital works when private investment is flat puts even more downward pressure on economic activity.

Deferring infrastructure doesn't eliminate need for them, it just defers the cost, typically returning at a higher cost. A bridge that needs replacing in 2027 doesn't stop deteriorating just because you've pushed the project to 2030. By the time you get to it, the scope may have expanded, the cost will have escalated and the economic disruption from the delayed work could be greater.

Most fundamentally, cutting

Most fundamentally, cutting infrastructure investment to manage debt in the short-term compromises our ability to generate the economic growth needed to sustainably service the debt over the longer term. It's like eating the corn seeds to avoid hunger today, while ensuring famine tomorrow.

The government's own 2021 Fiscal Sustainability Report required by the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act states clearly and unambiguously:

incurring debt to fund recurrent expenditure is not considered beneficial, or sustainable in the long-term. Servicing this type of debt can negatively impact the broader economy as it diverts revenue to a non-productive use. (TBC)

This isn't my opinion and it's not a political attack. This is what appears in the Treasury documents. This is the government's own policy framework for sound fiscal management, put on the public record less than six months ago by Treasury, free from the interference from the Treasurer of the day. Yet, the fiscal balance which counts both operating and capital spending shows a deficit of $1.35 billion in 2025. When you strip out the Commonwealth capital grants for specific infrastructure projects like the Bridgewater Bridge, Macquarie Point and road projects, the underlying net operating balance shows a deficit of $1.4 billion. 

Tasmania is borrowing not only to build infrastructure for future generations, but to pay for today's public sector wages, today's health systems operations, today's education costs - the 'groceries', in other words. By the government's own analysis, published in its own fiscal sustainability report, this is unsustainable and economically harmful. The government's fiscal sustainability report says borrowing for the recurrent expenditure is not beneficial or sustainable, but then the government borrows $1.4 billion for recurrent expenditure. Apparently, those policy frameworks may be for other people. Borrowing for infrastructure builds the future. Borrowing to pay today's bills mortgages it. Tasmania's doing both in accelerating amounts and calling it a plan.

Here's perhaps the cruellest irony in this entire fiscal mess: this government will now be forced to make the hard decisions they've deferred for a decade and they will have to make them during a period of broader economic weakness, which makes every choice harder and every outcome worse. With zero growth in 2024-25, and below-trend growth forecast in 2025-26 and 2026-27, any significant cuts to government expenditure will exacerbate the economic slowdown. Government spending through public sector wages, infrastructure investment and service delivery is one of the few things currently holding the Tasmanian economy up. Cut it sharply and you risk turning slow growth into stagnation or recession.

The government has comprehensively stuffed up, by delaying fiscal adjustment for so long. They could have made gradual, managed reforms when the economy was growing strongly in 2016 to 2019, they were in power then. They had the opportunity when they were in government to do that. The responsibility is theirs, are not someone else's. They could have used the post-COVID bounce in 2021-2022 to implement structural changes. Instead, they continue to spend aggressively, hire extensively and defer every hard decision. The government can't continue to blame COVID for this challenge, and I fully acknowledge the budgetary challenge that period presented. I also know the state actually spent within the appropriated budget over those relevant years, there were high overspends, but nothing like we're seeing now.

Why I say the government should stop blaming everyone but themselves, is that the problems were also clearly evident before COVID, not just since. The warnings were issued. I will go back to the 2019 Fiscal Sustainability Report. This report was required under the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act, prepared by Treasury, not the Treasurer. This is prepared every five years and this was an additional one, because the Public Accounts Committee had a look at the 2016 Fiscal Sustainability Report and identified an error in it, so Treasury redid it in 2019. It's an extra one, out of cycle. That's why there was one in that year.

In that 2019 report there was a warning in the conclusion to the executive summary. I will read from the 2019 Fiscal Sustainability Report from Treasury:

Therefore, efforts should continue to be made to identify and achieve efficiencies in the provision of health and other government services. This should include consideration of existing expenditures in the context of accessing whether programs have been effective in achieving their intended objectives, intended program outcomes are still required by the Tasmanian community and if so, what the current priority of these outcomes are relative to other health and non-health related programs, and there are efficiencies available in the delivery of current programs. However, the underlying drivers of growth in health expenditure are likely to continue. This will make it increasingly challenging to maintain fiscal sustainability in the future with expenditure constraint alone. It is recognised that constraining expenditure will present challenges and difficult choices. In addition, maintaining long-term fiscal sustainability for Tasmania and other Australian jurisdictions will require not just ongoing management of expenditure but also consideration of sources of revenue. In particular, long-term fiscal sustainability will require growth in expenditure to be matched with the sources of revenue that grow at the same rate. The rates of revenue growth required to maintain long-term fiscal sustainability are unlikely to be delivered through the expected growth in current revenue sources or major changes to existing taxation arrangements. While noting the challenges involved, it is likely that reform of the existing taxation system will be required, identifying new sources of revenue. (TBC)

That's from that report, Mr President.

We've not had a change of government since 2014. This report was in 2019. This was the responsibility of the government and the work of the current government to ignore that and not react or respond, despite Treasury doing everything they could to warn them. The Premier has been there the whole time. He's overseen all of these decisions as a member of Cabinet. The Treasurer is a relative newcomer in this picture but now must work with the Premier and the rest of Cabinet and stop blaming everyone else but themselves.

The reality is now that the government has run out of road, ignoring all the warnings at precisely the wrong time in the economic cycle. Any cuts made now will hurt more because they're cutting into an economy that's already weak and achieve less because the economic multiplier effects work in reverse when you're contracting government spending during a downturn. The fiscal adjustment will be both painful and less effective because it's happening at the bottom of the cycle rather than at the top when they had the opportunity to do so. This is textbook bad fiscal management - stimulating when you should be consolidating and then being forced to consolidate when you should be supporting the economy because of a failure to act.

Delaying fiscal reform until the economy slows is like trying to fix a roof during a cyclone. It'll cost more, hurt more and work less. The government's had 11 years to do this when conditions were favourable. Not all of the conditions up until COVID were favourable. Now they'll have to do it when conditions are far less favourable and every option is worse than it needs to be. Meanwhile, we're told the government's Multi-Partisan Budget Consultation Panel is developing a new fiscal strategy behind closed doors with no public oversight or vision.

This panel - established with much fanfare as evidence of the government's commitment to collaboration and transparency - is supposedly bringing crossbench members into the tent to develop long-term fiscal reform. But here's the catch, and a significant one that should concern any crossbench member considering genuine participation: unlike deliberations in parliamentary committees, the Budget Consultation Panel operates without parliamentary power, privilege or protection. Everything said in those meetings can potentially be used against participants later. If the panel recommends tough measures that prove politically unpopular or economically damaging, crossbenchers who participate run the risk of being blamed for supporting policies that were doomed from the start. They'll be complicit in the government's fiscal choices without gaining any actual power to implement alternative approaches. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=12.8_D=3.7_C=0.71]  It's a political trap and it's not genuine partnership [Bookmark: Phr3_O=17.1_D=7.4_C=0.68]  and when there is no public oversight of this at all, it's the (Treasurer's? 12.05.24) word against theirs.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=25.9_D=16.9_C=0.67] The government can claim it consulted broadly, involved the crossbenchers in developing recommendations, then cherry picked which recommendations to implement, while leaving crossbenchers exposed to political fallout when things go badly. They have no way to defend themselves because it's all behind closed doors. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=44.0_D=6.1_C=0.72]  The fiscal strategy remains formally unchanged in this budget. Sorry, I have to move back to our budget now. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=52.0_D=9.1_C=0.85]  This current fiscal strategy remains pretty much unchanged. There are a few minor changes to it, but there are no credible means to achieve the stated targets. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=61.9_D=11.8_C=0.71]  'Peak debt', keeps receding into the distance like a mirage in the desert. I did like, what was the word you used?

Mr Harriss - Jindalee.

Ms FORREST - Jindalee, that's  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=75.8_D=2.7_C=0.71] right. Surplus keeps being promised for  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=80.7_D=0.8_C=0.93] the year after next. Every year an endless cycle of deferred outcomes. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=91.1_D=5.0_C=0.92]  The targets themselves don't change, only the timeline  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=97.1_D=13.1_C=0.83] for missing them extends indefinitely. A new fiscal strategy and we'll have to wait to see what that is apparently in the next May budget, will be developed through this process with the cross benches, may normally [Bookmark: Phr13_O=111.0_D=29.3_C=0.71]  change the targets, it may change the whole strategy. There's nothing particularly wrong with the strategies. It's the fact that we're not getting anywhere near achieving them that's a problem. Perhaps they'll make the targets more realistic by lowering their ambition or extending timeframes, but without genuine structural reform it'll be no more achievable than the current one. Different numbers, same trajectory, inevitable failure.

Meanwhile, fiscal strategy 11 - the public sector efficiency, productivity and financial transparency [Bookmark: Phr14_O=141.1_D=13.5_C=0.77]  - will be improved in the preliminary outcome result which is insulting. We don't have the actuals through this Budget but no it's the strategic actions as  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=155.3_D=8.6_C=0.79] continuation of savings measures from previous budgets and responding to review and inquiry recommendations and the establishment of the efficiency and productivity unit [Bookmark: Phr16_O=164.8_D=11.5_C=0.76] .

I think the member for Huon also mentioned this. The target for this is a review will be taken in 2032-33, to assess the impact of the action taken. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=177.0_D=1.5_C=0.68]  Well, could be a bit late by then. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=179.9_D=12.3_C=0.83]  That is eight years away and we will be long gone over the fiscal cliff without real and meaningful actions. Not such insulting motherhood statements which insult mothers. The reality is both [Bookmark: Phr19_O=192.8_D=14.6_C=0.72]  major credit ratings Moody's and Standard and Poors, have downgraded, as I've mentioned earlier, Tasmania's outlook in 2024-25 from stable to negative this year.

This is not a minor technical adjustment. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=208.1_D=21.9_C=0.73]  This is not political commentary. This is the independent financial analysts concluding that Tasmania's fiscal trajectory presents increased risk. When both credit agencies put you on negative watch, which is what happened during the year, that's not a political opinion, it's a financial fire alarm. The government's been hitting the snooze button while the smoke fills the room.

 [Bookmark: Phr21_O=231.4_D=20.3_C=0.75] The credit riding agencies look at the same budget papers available to all of us and other financial reports. They see the structural deficits, the accumulating debt, the optimistic assumptions of workforce reductions and revenue growth and appropriation tricks disguised as savings. They see all of it and they reach a conclusion. [Bookmark: Phr22_O=252.3_D=4.4_C=0.63]  Tasmania physical position is deteriorating and there's no credible plan to reverse it. [Bookmark: Phr23_O=257.4_D=16.7_C=0.75]  There is no credible plan here to reverse that in these budget papers.

The government's own fiscal strategy sets a target of maintaining Aa(2) AA+ credit rating with a stable outlook by 2032-33. [Bookmark: Phr24_O=274.8_D=4.0_C=0.80]  We're not progressing toward that target. We're moving rapidly in the opposite direction. [Bookmark: Phr25_O=279.5_D=9.0_C=0.60]  As I said, the outlook is now negative. A negative outlook is typically a precursor to a natural downgrade in our rating, which is exactly what happened. [Bookmark: Phr26_O=289.2_D=2.9_C=0.77]  We're going backwards while the government claims we're going forwards. [Bookmark: Phr27_O=293.3_D=11.5_C=0.86]  A credit rating downgrade has had and will have, if there's future ones, real and immediate and cascading consequences. It means higher borrowing costs. Every new bond issue, every refinancing of existing debt will cost more.

High borrowing costs mean that more of every budget dollar must go to servicing debt rather than delivering services, which means deeper cuts or bigger deficits; which means more borrowings but even higher rates. This is how the fiscal death spiral begins.

The government can spin the Budget however it likes in press releases and media appearances; credit rating agents aren't impressed by rhetoric. They look at the cash flows, the debt trajectory, the revenue assumptions, the expenditure discipline, or lack thereof. When they see risk, they say so. And right now, they're seeing plenty of risk.

The Treasurer says Tasmania's future is bright. Both credit rating agencies just turned the lights to amber, and as I said, one of them is looking at the wrong dashboard.

We are headed into a fiscal chasm. How close to the point of no return, the event horizon, the boundary that surrounds a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape are we? The real question for the Treasurer is, are we nearing the budget event horizon or have we already crossed it?

We're at zero economic growth with $1.4 billion underlying profit deficit doubling to $10 billion in the general government sector and heading toward $20 billion overall; credit rating on negative watch or will downgrade to negative during that period; infrastructure being cut to manage debt pressures; and the government proposes to commit $609 million in equity funding to the Macquarie Point Development Corporation.

The Treasurer devotes more of his time in the budget speech to spruiking the stadium and explaining how we're going to achieve the workforce reduction the budget assumes. He waxes lyrical about economic benefits during construction, $269 million over five years, and ongoing operational benefits - $30 million annually. These are projections based on modelling, on assumptions. They're not certainties.

What's conspicuously missing from the budget speech and the budget papers is any discussion of the stadium's ongoing operational costs. The opportunity costs of tying up $609 million in equity when the state is borrowing for operating expenses, or the risks if projected revenues don't materialise. Experts around the world have many research papers that show that stadium economics are notoriously optimistic in the ex-ante projections and disappointing in the ex-post reality. Cities and states around the world have discovered this the hard way. The evidence clearly shows new stadiums rarely generate the transformational economic benefits their proponents promise. They frequently require ongoing operational subsidies long after ribbon cutting ceremonies frayed from the memory.

Tasmania will definitely benefit from an AFL team and new stadium. I'm not suggesting otherwise. Is it this stadium or another one? I don't know.

The social and cultural value of major sporting facilities shouldn't be dismissed, but committing over $600 million when you're borrowing to pay for nurses' salaries while cutting productive infrastructure elsewhere when you're heading toward unprecedented debt levels and both credit rating agencies have put us on negative watch, downgraded us to negative, is not prudent financial management.

It's more like a Hail Mary pass from a government that's run out of options and is hoping the stadium will somehow generate the economic growth they've failed to achieve through actual economic policy. You can have both, but you can't ignore one. When you're maxing out the credit card to pay for the groceries, buying a boat is not a prudent financial management decision, even if you really want to go fishing.

Strip away the rhetoric, ignore the spin, and look what the Budget actually does rather than what it says. If I'm doing the same calculation as anyone else, this is just in relation to that, and from what I'm aware nothing has been included in the budget Estimates themselves that reflects an actual reduction.

As I said before, the major savings that they have put in haven't been allocated to employee costs at all. I go back to that point, the appropriation is an authority to spend money, it's not actual money and changing the numbers on the Treasurer's Reserve do nothing. Nothing, except make it more like we're going need a big supplementary appropriation bill.

The pattern is clear. The government will find $609 million for the stadium, some from the federal government and some from the AFL - not much, I might add. However, it hasn't found funding for redundancies that would be required to meet the revised fiscal strategy 10, that includes the NFTE target that implies a reduction of about 2800 jobs. That's what the Budget assumes. They haven't found funding for redundancies to cover any of that.

They will maintain funding for marketing and communications, despite claiming to reduce it, and reduce the Treasurer's Reserve by 60 per cent: a mere illusion. They defer productive infrastructure which would support economic growth, but they will commit to a discretionary sports facility. They will borrow to fund for operating deficits, but they will rule out examination of revenue options. These are choices; they reflect priorities. The government has every right to determine its own priorities, and the parliament needs to decide if they agree with those priorities: that's in all matters covered in the Budget. 

The priorities revealed in this budget are fundamentally and unfortunately at odds with what sound fiscal management requires. The interim Budget is government-speak for, 'We will make the hard decisions later.' Later has actually arrived; you can't keep kicking the can any further down the road. The debt is accumulating, the structural deficit is widening, and the government's response is to present a budget with appropriation tricks, unallocated savings, optimistic assumptions, and deferred decisions and expenditure. The trajectory from here is depressingly predictable, because we've seen this pattern repeated multiple times over the past decade. 

This is my prediction: within three to six months we will see supplementary appropriations to cover the cost pressures that the reduced Treasurer's Reserve and unallocated efficiency measures were never going to accommodate. Agencies will have spent beyond their appropriations, ministers will have made necessary funding commitments and a supplementary appropriation bill will be brought to the parliament to restore much of what was notionally saved. Last year's supplementary appropriation dollars from memory was about $450 million: no small number.

Within a year, the 2026-27 Budget will present revised forward Estimates that push peak debt out another year, and revise the timeline for returning to surplus. The Revised Estimates Report may provide some other enlightenment on that in February. The actual 2025-26 outcome will show a large deficit than budgeted, workforce reduction smaller than targeted, capital expenditure underspend, confirming infrastructure cuts, or overspend, confirming that lack of expenditure discipline. 

Within two years, either the economic assumptions will fail, evidenced by growth undershoots, revenue disappointments and/or exports decline, or the savings won't materialise, evidenced by workforce reductions that prove unachievable, efficiency measures that deliver less than projected or cost more than expected, or face a genuine crisis that makes today's problems look manageable by comparison.

The Treasurer might hope that Tasmanians won't notice the accumulating evidence that none of this adds up. The credit rating agencies notice; financial markets notice. Every six months, when new data comes out showing the actual trajectory diverging from the budgeted one, the gap between the rhetoric and reality becomes more obvious. You can't spin zero economic growth into prosperity, and you can't suggest symbolic savings create a way out of a $1.4 billion structural deficit. Eventually maths wins. The numbers always win.

The only question is how much damage gets done while we pretend otherwise? Some of these so-called savings measures, such as the three new measures, office and leasing improvements, procurement process enhancements, expenditure improvements, also relate to matters raised by the Tasmanian Audit Office through some of their excellent performance audits. These are some of the savings measures that they talk about in the budget papers.

One report that doesn't seem to have been picked up is one of the audit office's reports, the new savings measures relating to the Department of Health's administration of funding to community service organisations, which the Auditor-General referred to as 'ineffective'. The Auditor-General stated from his report when he tabled it that:[tbc]

Health management of funding arrangements was fundamentally flawed. Health had not established effective frameworks, arrangements or monitoring activities.

He went on to say that he assessed how well Health administered funding to community service organisations, noting these organisations are critical to the Tasmanian health system and they rely on government funding.

He also said:[tbc]

The Department of Health had known about the issues with the funding administration for a long time. Recommendations to fix community service organisation funding were made to either Health or the state government as a whole in 2009, 2016 and 2021.

And here's a performance audit tabled this year that told us it hasn't been addressed. Health's failing approach to grants management and quality and safety was identified by management back in 2019. Systemic issues with procurement and contract management were known since at least early 2024, yet these issues have not been fixed. Maybe they're working on it now since the Auditor-General did his most recent report. It doesn't get much more damning than that, so I expect nothing less than to see these recommendations adopted, and I challenge the notion these are new savings measures.

Improvements such as these, along with other recommendations made by the audit office across a range of areas, need to be done regardless, and should be done when they're recommended and not considered new ideas or new savings measures. If they save money, good. They should. That's the audit office's job, to point out where there are inefficiencies. These are desperate claims by an inept government that they are doing something, the savings measures I mentioned, but these actions are a government following sensible recommendations made by the Auditor-General following a governance and government failure.

Tasmania doesn't need an interim Budget with symbolic and sham savings, appropriation shell games with partially-funded initiatives designed to look fiscally responsible until the next election or whenever we see the next budget appear that maybe does something. We don't need a budget that focuses on general government debt while ignoring the full $20 billion picture. We don't need optimistic assumptions about workforce reductions with no funding for redundancies, or revenue projections dependent on government businesses that can't deliver returns, or infrastructure cuts disguised as reprofiling. 

We need honest numbers that acknowledge the true scale of the challenge. We need structural reform that addresses the root causes of unsustainable spending growth, not symbolic efficiency measures and hiring freezes. We need a comprehensive revenue review that examines whether we're raising what we should from our revenue base, not a political taboo on any discussion around our revenues. We need a realistic workforce strategy that either funds redundancies or acknowledges services reduction, not fairytale assumptions about attrition.

Most fundamentally, we need a government willing to level with Tasmanians about the choices ahead and the trade-offs required, not a political document designed to get you through the next six months without difficult decisions. This Budget delivers none of that. It's political theatre performed with public money, a carefully-constructed illusion of fiscal responsibility that collapses under even moderate scrutiny. The Treasurer promises peak debt in 2028-29, when his own cashflow statement shows net borrowings of $734 million that year.

He promises surpluses while relying on unallocated savings that won't materialise and reduced reserves that won't cover actual needs. He promises reform when delivering an interim Budget, defers every hard choice to some future date when presumably political conditions will be more favourable, or perhaps it's no longer his problem. When the reckoning comes, and it will, because maths is not subject to political spin, we should not forget that we were warned.

I and others have been warning of this for years now, and I really appreciate the contribution of other members who clearly have their head around this fact that we have real problems. The numbers are there in the budget papers in black and white. Anyone willing to read past the press statement and dig into the tables will see that. The credit rating agencies are explicit in their concerns: the pattern of supplementary appropriations, blown forecasts, and deferred reforms are clearly established over a decade of fiscal management - or mismanagement.

The question is whether anyone in government is willing to do something about it before it's too late, and based on this budget, the answer appears to be no. Tasmania deserves better than the government that treats the state budget as a political document to be managed through the election cycle, rather than a fiscal plan to secure an economic future. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=12.2_D=9.8_C=0.78]  We deserve better than accounting illusions disguised as reform. We deserve better than spin that contradicts the numbers on the very same pages.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=23.1_D=14.4_C=0.79] The government can keep claiming the future is bright, but when both credit agencies have turned the lights to amber and debt is heading toward $20 billion and we're borrowing for operating expenses, the government's own policy says it's unsustainable [Bookmark: Phr4_O=38.8_D=22.8_C=0.82] . When government economic growth reveals a decade of the strongest growing economy, that rhetoric has hit a brick wall. Brightness is not the word that comes to mind.

To conclude, for years I've documented the warning signs across every corner of Tasmania's public finances. This year we see Hydro Tasmania's 99 per cent profit collapse [Bookmark: Phr5_O=62.4_D=4.1_C=0.69] , TasNetworks achieving just one of its six performance targets [Bookmark: Phr6_O=67.3_D=8.0_C=0.80]  with net profit falling 75 per cent short, TT-Line solvency concerns with $894 million in debt [Bookmark: Phr7_O=76.4_D=8.0_C=0.72] , and a complete failure of governments and oversight by government with vessels sitting idle and government bailouts required, just to name a few. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=85.7_D=16.4_C=0.82]  These aren't isolated failures, they're symptoms of the same disease. A decade of deferred decisions, political cowardice masquerading as fiscal management, and systemic refusal to face hard truths until avoiding them becomes impossible.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=102.6_D=4.7_C=0.63] Now the bills arrived and it's coming to a precisely the wrong moment [Bookmark: Phr10_O=108.0_D=1.8_C=0.71] , when economic growth is stalled to zero [Bookmark: Phr11_O=110.6_D=11.1_C=0.77] , when climate change is fundamentally changing business models we took for granted and with every option becoming harder and every outcome worse because of what is too long [Bookmark: Phr12_O=122.3_D=3.8_C=0.92] , despite warnings issued by Treasury since 2016.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=127.5_D=3.5_C=0.68] The credit rating agencies aren't fooled by accounting tricks. They see what I see. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=132.0_D=29.9_C=0.74]  A government counting on Hydro dividends that have evaporated, TasNetworks returns that have collapsed and revenue projections built on a foundation of sand. They see debt heading toward $2 billion, while the Treasurer points to half the picture and calls it peak debt. They see symbolic savings, vanishing reserves and unfunded workforce redundancies. They are warning us we're heading possibly toward another downgrade that will make every problem more expensive and every [Bookmark: Phr15_O=162.0_D=1.4_C=0.86]  solution more painful.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=167.0_D=0.6_C=0.89]  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=171.0_D=5.0_C=0.67] I am almost certain we'll see supplementary appropriation within months [Bookmark: Phr18_O=179.4_D=6.0_C=0.82]  and that will then give us the true picture of how much this was underfunded [Bookmark: Phr19_O=186.5_D=7.0_C=0.69] . On Health, for example, from memory $48 million less than what is being budgeted and what was spent last year. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=194.4_D=11.2_C=0.73]  You can't claim we continue to increase health spending if that's the reality, unless you're going to cut some services? [Bookmark: Phr21_O=207.1_D=0.7_C=0.13]  Tell us.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=209.8_D=9.9_C=0.66] Tasmania doesn't just need better budgeting; we need structural transformation. We need honest assessment of whether our central business models can survive in a climate change world [Bookmark: Phr23_O=220.9_D=6.8_C=0.75] . I particularly focus on those because we have important government businesses who rely on the weather [Bookmark: Phr24_O=228.3_D=1.0_C=0.92]  and climate [Bookmark: Phr25_O=230.2_D=5.8_C=0.63] . The climate's changed and we don't didn't see any mention of that.

 [Bookmark: Phr26_O=237.1_D=4.8_C=0.88] We need comprehensive review that the Commonwealth Grants Commission says we're not raising what we should. [Bookmark: Phr27_O=242.5_D=14.3_C=0.65]  We need workforce strategies that either fund redundancies or acknowledged service cuts, not fairy tale stories about attrition. We need infrastructure investment decision based on economic merit, not political symbolism or bullying demands.

 [Bookmark: Phr28_O=259.3_D=25.2_C=0.82] Most fundamentally, we need a government willing to tell Tasmanians the truth. That decades of the strongest growing economy rhetoric have hit a brick wall, and that money from our government businesses dried up just when we need it most. That we're borrowing to pay for today's groceries in ways the government's own policy framework says is unsustainable, and that every month we pretend otherwise makes eventual reckoning more catastrophic.

 [Bookmark: Phr29_O=285.6_D=4.3_C=0.39] The Budget and Accounting and Oversight Committee Bill that I championed [Bookmark: Phr30_O=290.1_D=14.9_C=0.67]  would have provided transparent, continuous scrutiny that Tasmania desperately needs. This House rejected it with the exception of the members for Launceston and Elwick. The multi-partisan budget consultation panel operates behind closed doors with no parliamentary privilege or public accountability. The patterns that got us here, the supplementary appropriations, the blown forecasts, the optimistic assumptions, the deferred reforms continue unabated.

Let me be absolutely clear about what's coming. Within months, the savings of this budget will prove illusory and the supplementary appropriations will follow. Within a year, peak debt will have receded further into the distance. Within two years, we'll face a fiscal crisis that makes the $1.4 billion today look manageable. We risk another credit downgrade. Borrowing costs will rise. Net service cuts will possibly deepen. The economic pain will spread.

When Tasmania is asked how we got there, the answer will be simple: we had the numbers, we had the warnings, we had the choice to act, and the government chose spin over substance, symbolism over structure, and political survival over Tasmania's future. The event horizon - the point of no return - may already be behind us, but whether we've crossed it or are merely approaching it, one thing is certain: hitting the snooze button while the building burns is not a strategy, it's a betrayal.

I made the comment in my reply to the budget in May this year when I stated that I've always held the view that a government has a right and duty to bring down a budget to deliver for Tasmanian services, infrastructure and a vision for the future. I reiterate my position that in the absence of illegal borrowings or gross malfeasance, I've always held that it is up to the government to provide services, infrastructure and a vision for the future - even if I would prefer to see other priorities at the margins.

I've sought to scrutinise the Budget and hold the government the day to account, including through my work on the Public Accounts Committee, to ensure we know how public money is being spent, on what, and for what outcome., I sought to establish the budget accountability and oversight committee, because there is an absolute need for this sort of oversight.

This is the second time in my 20-plus years here, within a matter of months, where I've had to ask myself, again: can I, in all good conscience, support this budget? The budget that defers the reckoning, that comprehensively fails to provide an honest assessment of the fiscal situation we are in.

It doesn't include additional equity TT-Line is inevitably going to need in the out-years, unless other drastic action occurs, such as seeing the new vessels to lease them back. That may be the plan they come back with, I don't know. Either that, or significant amounts of millions of dollars every year being put into it from the state government, which means more borrowings to deliver operational services - the things that every Tasmanian relies on.

This Budget doesn't seriously contemplate the reduction in the big returns we have become reliant on from our own revenues, from a number of previously well-performing government businesses which have had a serious impact this year and likely next year and beyond - when dividends from their poor performance this year flow through. That's not necessarily their fault; there's good reasons why some of that's occurred. However, we can't rely on it, especially in businesses whose operations and profitability are subject to the very real impacts of climate change and weather conditions in ways that seem to have not been fully factored in. Add to this the delayed and reduced or canned infrastructure spending that many communities have fought hard to find the support of the government for, right around the state, and the inevitable need to top up health for the budget.

The budget operating expense is $48 million less this year than what was actually spent in the 2024-25 financial year. This Budget delays the repair and it denies the depth of the challenge. It is a government with its head in the sand and/or lacking the financial literacy or wherewithal to face reality.

Those comments I made about whether or not to support the budget were related to that last budget, but the same situation applies now - only, it's worse. This is not a better budget. All the tricks and pushing out of expenditure, that's what makes it look better. It's not better.

Ms O'Connor - That's right, it's so obvious.

Ms Webb - Exactly, empty forward Estimates.
Ms FORREST - Yes. They are just more misleading tricks and delays to expenditure spending to make it look better. The cynic in me would say that it's all been done and pushed up - 'push, push push, let's just take a few million off the Treasurer's Reserve,' - those sorts of tricks to make the budget look less bad ahead of a crucial vote in a couple of weeks.

The first step in any recovery is to stem the bleeding. I don't believe this Budget will do this for the reasons I've stated. There are risks everywhere, from budget efficiency measures that won't work and reprofiling infrastructure which exacerbates rather than solves problems, to pretending that Health won't require supplementary appropriation and pretending that the $75 million equity injection with the $25 million capital, is all that TT-Line will need, when the boats are still at least a year off in terms of getting into service, there are risks everywhere. You won't be able to stem the bleeding and keep the patient alive unless you raise more revenue.

Looking further ahead, the government was banking on Marinus to provide an extra boost of $400 million per annum, but now it seems that the focus may be more energy security than making money. When the place is burning to the ground, I don't believe we in this House should be doing nothing, suggesting is the role of the executive and we shouldn't be upsetting the sacred system, the very system that allowed this mess to occur. We can accept Public Accounts Committee positions, but only as pathologists and coroners, but I don't accept that if I agree to be pathologist or a coroner, that precludes me from actually trying to douse the flames.

It's only when the patient is stable and we can look at debt reduction or at least a reduction in the life-threatening debt servicing costs, the way I see it and possibly the only way this will occur, is when the federal government takes over some of the state's debt. They already own $56 billion worth of states' debts via the Reserve Bank of Australia - that's the bank we all own - including $1 billion of TASCORP bonds. When the time comes to pay interest on those bonds, states will negotiate a deal with the federal government seeking interest relief or even forgiveness. This can extend to when the bonds mature and need to be redeemed. It's just like the state's housing debt that was forgiven a few years ago and members may remember that, and so too will state debts. It's the only way out of the fiscal mire the states are actually facing.

But first, we need to stabilise the patient. That's a job for all of us, not just the executive branch. Quite frankly, I think the task is beyond the current executive from what we've seen here. Nothing in this Budget gives me confidence. Tasmania deserves leaders who will face these challenges with the honesty and courage that they demand. Until we get them, I'll be sounding the alarm, documenting the evidence and demanding accountability that Tasmanians here have every right to expect from those entrusted with their future. Mr President, the lights are flashing red, the smoke is filling the room and there's no one else coming to put out the fire.

[12.38 p.m.]
Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, well, here we are again. Take two in fact, the second time we've contemplated a state Budget this year.

Ms Forrest - Did you pull out your last speech?

Ms WEBB - Actually, what I can do right at the outset of my contribution is indicate how proud I am of this Chamber actually, and how edifying it's been to listen to budget reply speeches across yesterday and today. Particularly, I pay respect to my independent colleagues in this Chamber who have made excellent contributions on this Budget. Insightful, informed, passionate, clearly demonstrating their care for their community and their genuine desire to be electoral representatives of them in this place, this important house of review. I say that noting that there's still contributions yet to come from other members that I'm not able to reflect on yet, but I'm sure will be excellent.

It's really fantastic to see how engaged and forensic members have been in their reflections on this Budget and I appreciate the effort that's gone into that, particularly I'm noting here, the member for Murchison, who's just spoken on the Budget, but also from yesterday, the member for Elwick, the member for Montgomery and the member for Huon, who all provided very comprehensive contributions and really dug in to the detail of what we're looking at here, and it's not pretty, Madam Deputy President, it's not pretty at all.

We all know the whys and the wherefores of how we find ourselves in this position considering the second budget delivered for the 2025-26 financial year, this second iteration differentiated from its May counterpart by the designation of 'interim'. However, it's worthwhile to briefly place the current state Budget within the context of the analysis of and the concerns about that May version, that was given as a pivotal catalyst resulting in that snap election in July. A key criticism of the May Budget was its refusal, or just gross failure, to take on board and act on the Eslake Independent Review of Tasmania's State Finances, which was released in August 2024.

A good eight months between the release of that independent Eslake report and the presentation of the May state Budget one would think would provide sufficient time to consider the recommendations of that independent review of our financial system, and respond accordingly with a fit-for-purpose fiscal reform plan as outlined in the next state Budget. One would have thought that it did indeed provide the political cover to bring forward a genuine proposal for reform, back in that May Budget. If there was a moment that a pivot could have happened to actual action from this government on fiscal reform, that was it, and we didn't see hide nor hair of it. We know that it was certainly not the case, that is what was presented in the May Budget, despite the clear articulation in the 2024 Eslake Independent Review that:

Tasmania's general government finances have deteriorated sharply over the past six years and will do so further over the next three years. (TBC)

The range of recommendations required to address revenue and expenditure challenges to shift the state towards fiscal sustainability were largely ignored by the former treasurer, in that earlier May Budget. Further, the May Budget tried to blithely blame everyone else from the federal government, to previous state governments long in the past which were in existence well over a decade ago. It also tried to blame the bogeyman of the public sector for this government. By doing so, by throwing that blame around at all and sundry, that earlier budget attempt was roundly criticised for kicking the development of coherent fiscal reforms can down the road.

The reason why it's informative to briefly remind ourselves why it is we're dealing with an 'interim Budget' in November, the second for the financial year, is to test and evaluate to what extent were those key lessons learned by the government, from the disastrous May Budget to the current interim one now before us. The answer is resoundingly clear in terms of lessons learned - very little is the answer. Very few lessons learned, despite the interim Budget presenting 'a marginally less dire picture of Tasmania's public finances', which was the summary from economist Saul Eslake. The current Budget papers and the current Treasurer's speech on this Budget revealed that unfortunately, very little of long-term strategic substance was in fact learned.

One change, though, was evident, and that's the effort made to try to sugarcoat the reality is persisting. This interim 2025-26 Budget has been described in some quarters as 'a work of fiction', and I would have to agree. The Treasurer's formal budget speech and the interim Budget papers presented a fantastical presentation of sets of numbers, which do not add up, and a range of ideologically-driven policy approaches which threaten to entrench the fact those numbers will keep failing to add up, far into the future. Not only did the Treasurer present a work of fiction, it is, I would say, a dark fantasy of some kind, Tim Burton-esque, perhaps. Exaggeration, distortion and clearly disconnected from reality, the reality of the average Tasmanian. We were told of 'realistic optimism' and 'success of the past decade'. Absolute fantasy.

Further, Tasmanians were told of their 'bright future' amidst the promises of a 'self-sustaining Budget'. Sadly, I think what we will find is many Tasmanians are struggling to find secure housing, to keep their heads above the increasing costs of living and they may well have a different definition of realistic optimism, or a sense of when their future may be bright. Certainly, the approximately 2800 public sector employees facing unemployment in coming years may not be sharing such a bright vision of optimism for their future.

Another example of that glossing over or, 'gaslighting' may be another term, is the reliance upon Tasmania's apparently lowest unemployment rate of any state as an indicator of a growing and strong economy. However, what isn't said is the fact that a much smaller proportion of Tasmania's population is in work, or actively looking for it, compared to the rest of the nation. Tasmania is at 61.4 per cent as of September compared to the national figure of 67 per cent. That's just one example of selective use of data that this government uses to [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.2_D=29.7_C=0.79]  manipulate a narrative. 

Selective use of data is a speciality of this Rockliff Liberal government. You only have to look at the much-trumpeted 10,000 new homes by 2032 to see another example. That rubbery number of 'new homes' is going to include blocks of land, crisis accommodation beds - which are absolutely needed but by no means a secure, long-term affordable home - houses taken out of the existing private rental or property market which are not new additional supply, just repurposed [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.2_D=12.7_C=0.82] , et cetera, et cetera. That 10,000 new homes is a flashy headline grab for media and social media, but in reality, it's nothing but manipulation and spin. There are many more examples like this, but I move on.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=73.5_D=15.6_C=0.75] Others such as Mr Saul Eslake, as I mentioned before outside this place, and here in this place, including in these budget replies from members for Elwick, Huon, Montgomery, Murchison and Mersey have already placed granular critiques of this Budget on the public record, and I'm not going to be delving into the numbers in as much detail as those members in my contribution. However, I will point to the glaring common failure shared in both the May and the current interim Budget: their failure to even attempt to grapple with the financial structural challenges that our state faces [Bookmark: Phr6_O=117.2_D=2.8_C=0.70] , or provide a holistic plan to get from the current situation [Bookmark: Phr7_O=120.6_D=20.0_C=0.85]  to a position of actual fiscal sustainability. 

Bizarrely, the Treasurer has tried to describe this Budget as a glide path to surplus and a balanced budget. That's nothing less than deliberate obfuscation, an attempt to disguise the utter lack of any real plan for equitable budget repair. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=141.4_D=23.9_C=0.83]  In fact, last Friday, the day after the Budget was brought down, the Treasurer said on ABC Mornings radio, 'and so with budget repair, and that's their language, I would say budget improvement.' That's a farcical degree of denial right there. These interim Budget papers present a doubling down as it were, a more deliberate and perverse kicking of that budget repair can down the road [Bookmark: Phr9_O=169.7_D=3.7_C=0.78] . A newspaper editorial [Bookmark: Phr10_O=174.3_D=4.3_C=0.80]  in The Mercury put it pithily on Saturday:

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=179.5_D=6.0_C=0.82] The old saying goes that the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second-best time is now. So too with budget repair.
 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=185.8_D=30.0_C=0.82] 
And then further:

The nature of the problem should be well understood. The mounting debt problem facing the state Budget was laid out in Treasury's Fiscal Sustainability Report as far back as 2021. It was elegantly restated in Saul Eslake's Independent Review of Tasmania's State Finances in 2024, and yet the government seems determined to put off decisive action for as long as possible. Having ruled out tax increases and asset sales, spending cuts are the preferred method of balancing the books, with increasing numbers of public-sector job cuts on the cards.
 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=215.9_D=0.6_C=0.85] 
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=217.9_D=29.3_C=0.81] That paints a picture a little more realistic and a little starker than the Treasurer's preferred terminology of 'budget improvement'. But language semantics aside, the critical issue of, and the urgent need for meaningful structural fiscal reform of the state's finances is widely recognised outside the executive government. It has been for a long, long time: and no, Treasurer Abetz, it didn't just start with COVID, as other members have rightly pointed out.

This state [Bookmark: Phr15_O=247.6_D=29.7_C=0.82]  and the nation received much earlier warning bells, for example, in the form of the global financial crisis (GFC) in 2009. And there have been other instances prior to that which threw into sharp relief our vulnerability to external global financial pressures and limited domestic capacity to mitigate those impacts. At the core of the growing cause for real structural reform is recognition for the need for greater and more equitable resilience to be hard-baked into those areas of our financial system which [Bookmark: Phr16_O=277.4_D=27.6_C=0.80]  the state can control or mitigate. 

During the COVID period, I and many other voices from the community sector warned that so-called corrective budgetary measures risked calcifying current social and economic inequities, that we risked entrenching the growing chasm between the haves and the have nots: those with hope and those without. As the Mercury editorial stated, there were calls as far back as 2021:[tbc]

… to seize the opportunity and seriously assess and restructure how to disrupt intergenerational inequities and consciously rebuild our financial structures upon socially, economically equitable and sustainable foundations.

We were concerned then and we remain concerned now that debt-ridden budgets become the stalking horse to justify politically, ideologically-driven agendas under the guise of 'responsible' financial reforms, particularly budgets with such disparity between revenue capacity and spending levels. Instead of meaningful discussion about real reform, what have we seen since the COVID shock of 2020? Well, let's have a look. 

We saw an early 2021 state election with more pork-barrelling than you could poke a stick at, and then again with the early 2024 state election, another festival of splurging from the Liberals as they blithely racked up massive debt in election commitments again, as others have noted. Three-quarters of the debt that we've added over the past decade has been the result of reckless election promises made by the Liberal government. 

Let's be clear on what that means: this Liberal government has been prepared to max out our state credit card to the detriment of generations to come, to buy electoral outcomes for themselves, to keep their grip on power, and that's shameful, utterly shameful. In that same shameful vein, we're now seeing positioning in this interim Budget setting up public sector workers as the fiscal fall guy for this government's political self-interest. Let's be clear: nobody argues there is not scope for ongoing improvement and modernising in our public service, absolutely there is. 

However, when the only flagged cost saving measure of consequence is to cut spending in one area, such as the public sector and those public services provided, rather than, oh, I don't know, maybe a proposed white elephant on the horizon - we know that the estimated costs have already blown out catastrophically for that white elephant before even the hypothetical sod is turned on it. That's an ideologically driven choice. How should we avoid the ideologically-driven budget 'improvements' over evidence-based, objective budget repair measures?

Well, I want to talk for a moment about budget repair measures to reiterate some of the ideas and proposals that have been previously discussed in this place by me and others and deserve to be reiterated. Maybe, if we keep putting it out there, at some stage the government's going to be desperate enough to pick them up, or we might have a change of government with a more receptive ear to some of these opportunities.

Some members would recall that I've previously proposed that the state establish an independent expert panel to undertake a review of our financial system, particularly including the current and potential revenue streams and how we develop an equitable path to a sustainable future by addressing our revenue issues. 'Equitable' is the key term in this context, and one I'm not hearing much in the context of the interim Budget, that's for sure. The cost and brunt of getting from here to there under this Budget and the projections of the next Budget are not going be shared equitably or fairly.

For the for the benefit of new members, I believe it's worthwhile to reiterate my previous call for, for example, an independent expert fiscal reform panel, the purpose of which would be to take the political self-interest and ideological blockages out of the equation to the greatest extent possible. I also think it's pertinent within the context of recent debates in this place of how to improve parliamentary oversight of the executive's budgetary decisions and implementation.

Ms Forrest - Budget oversight committee.

Ms WEBB - Yes, it didn't do the same thing, and I'm not going to get into that debate here, because it's an entirely different vehicle that I'm suggesting, and I will address some of that in my contribution. I will reiterate my call again here, that in the context of the economic challenges faced by our state, the growing inequality that's holding our communities back, and the stark realities of cuts that this and future budgets bode, we urgently need meaningful and effective structural reform of Tasmania's taxation and revenue system. This work becomes more imperative every year. 

Enough with the inequitable tinkering. The state deserves comprehensive strategic review and reform. We know this. People will rightly point out that parliament has tried this previously, and some members here were recalling, in fact participated in, a tax review panel established back in 2010 under the power-sharing parliament that was in place at that time. That panel consisted of the then Labor treasurer, Lara Giddings MP, Liberal opposition treasury spokesperson, Peter Gutwein MP, the Greens treasury spokesperson, Tim Morris MP, and as an independent representing the upper House, the member for Murchison, Ms Forrest.

Some might be thinking this sounds a bit like the spurious multi-party panel the Treasurer has convened in the lower House to inform the next Budget, but a key distinction was the 2010 panel's terms of reference were public, they invited public submissions and hearings were also held publicly. However, it couldn't avoid the inevitable unfortunately self-interest of its political party membership with both Labor and Liberal representatives withdrawing from the panel as soon it was time to make hard decisions.

An experience which reinforces the need for such fiscal reform entities to be truly independent of, but also accountable to, the parliament An independently appointed expert panel to undertake a fiscal review of the state's current taxation and revenue base and mechanisms to address the structural deficit, including how to diversify a progressive taxation and revenue base, purposeful transformative taxation review of the state's recognised narrow taxation and revenue base, should seek potential, modern, equitable and efficient means to broaden that base.

It should test whether the current mix and emphasis of the state tax and revenue base provides the stability and certainty necessary to deliver important community services. Crucially, it could test whether there are any current revenue foregone options presented within our current state tax and revenue mix.

Finally, it could identify any required transitional time frames and support, including funding to assist those most affected by any proposed reforms.

Obviously, and sadly, any suggestion of taxation reform presents considerable political risk to the government or the opposition proposing it. We do need to take the political sting out of it somehow. Hence, I can only ever see this necessary work occurring via an independent panel of experts or another mechanism to achieve similar ends, which would not be constrained by political ideology and should be able to provide rigorous and credible options brought back to this parliament for open debate.

In fact, it would then be on the shoulders of this parliament and this parliament in its makeup, with a minority in the lower house in the other place and a largely independent membership of an upper House should be well placed to be able to advocate for and put appropriate pressure on the executive to begin to adopt measures brought to us by a panel that was independent and was providing advice and recommendations.

The proposed expert panel on this kind of fiscal reform should be open and accountable too. It should invite stakeholder and community submissions and it would report to this parliament, not to the government of the day. As such, it could then inform parliamentary input and oversight of the government's implementation of any recommendations made by the expert panel or in fact parliament exerting its power and using the mechanisms available to it to push the government towards the implementation of those recommendations.

We already have a similar model in play with the commission of inquiry report and recommendations which we received and tabled in this parliament. We then established a joint sessional committee tasked with examining the implementation of the recommendations that came from that separate independent commission of inquiry via their report.

I mentioned foregone potential revenue sources as needing review. This is a weakness in this interim budget, for sure. In fact, the bipartisan aversion to tackling this component of fiscal responsibility in a constructive manner is a broader weakness beyond just one particular budget or government.

However, in the context of this particular interim Budget, it's important to not just brush off the set of figures comprising the state's revenue base. As the Treasurer's speech details, the total revenue for the general government sector is estimated to be $9.5 billion. And as we are all aware, the majority of that $9.5 billion state income, two thirds in fact, is derived from federal grants.

The Treasurer goes to considerable pains to emphasise how our largest revenue source, the GST, is, and I quote: (tbc 12.59)

Highly sensitive to national consumer spending population share and GST relativity determined by the Commonwealth Grants Commission.

Hence, Mr President, we have the periodic posturing and arguably between the states and the Commonwealth and between all states vying for larger slices of the GST pie. We've all witnessed that GST caper and I'm sure we'll continue to do so.

However, it's interesting to note the extent to which the government positions both our reliance upon and our vulnerability to variations in federal grants as the context framing the fiscal choices the government does have the power and flexibility to make.

Primarily, I mean the decision to rely almost exclusively on cutting spending with minimal focus, if any, on investigating additional or alternative revenue sources. This is despite the Treasurer's speech stating - and I quote:

Sitting suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.


RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

Mr PRESIDENT - Before calling on Question Time, I welcome to our Chamber this afternoon the year 5 students from The Launceston Preparatory School. We have two groups coming in.

We are about to start our Question Time, which is where members can ask questions of the government or the ministers in this Chamber. That will fill out our next half an hour and then we will get back to members' contributions on the recent Budget.
On behalf of all members, thank you for visiting parliament. We hope you enjoy your time in the Legislative Council and the broader parliament.

Members - Hear, hear.


QUESTIONS

Spirit of Tasmania V - Berthing Costs

Ms ARMITAGE question to MINISTER FOR INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

[2.31 p.m.]
This is a question that I'm asked all the time.

Can you please explain how paying $600,000 a month to a foreign government to berth Spirit of Tasmania V is better than paying up to $1 million a month to a Tasmanian government business enterprise with the money staying in Tasmania? It's accepted the cost is greater in Tasmania, owing to the ships' needing to be moved regularly in the active port, but nevertheless the money would be going to Tasmanian businesses and families as opposed to a foreign entity.

ANSWER

Mr President, there is a fair bit to this, and I might read this out to start with and then punctuate a few other things. Wherever the new Spirit of Tasmania vessels are berthed, the majority of the costs are with the expert crew that's needed, and the fuelling required to keep it powered up. The mooring cost is a small percentage of the total cost of wherever these vessels are, so it's not right to say TasPorts, as the other GBE, would be receiving $1 million. The actual port costs aren't as high as some of the other costs involved. The wharf in Hobart is what is classed as an active berth, so staffing is higher than it is in Leith and that's mainly because with an active berth you have to be able to move the ship at any time and it's the same when it's out on anchor.

The sea level does not change in the Leith harbour so there is no wear and tear on mooring lines which makes it easy to maintain and no effect on the ship from swell or tidal movements, so there is not quite the same amount of monitoring.

Only six crew are required to be on board Spirit of Tasmania V at Leith whereas 22 crew are required at the Hobart berth or Hobart anchor. Regardless of the costs, there's a practical side to the whole issue.

We need to keep Spirit of Tasmania V in the Northern Hemisphere because all our crews are busy with the summer period coming through. It's not just the crew on the ship at any one time; you need to have relief crew for sickness and a complete rotation of crews as well, and to take people out of that situation for the long journey home really runs short for the busy time of the year where there are extra sailings involved.

As the season quiets down, we will be able to reconfigure the crews so that we have the ability to send the crew there to sail it home. They do rotate the crew, say halfway home, because the complete journey is too much for one crew to do. Somewhere along the way at one of the ports they do have fly-in fly-out, as you might might describe it for the crew.

The other point in the timing for bringing it home is that it will be at the end of the cruise season here so that we are able to bring it into the same berth here in Hobart to do some of those final fit-outs [Bookmark: Phr2_O=14.7_D=9.6_C=0.86]  - as well as open it up for a longer period of time for the public to have the same pleasure that many of us have had of going through the ship on several occasions.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=24.8_D=29.7_C=0.69] Ms Armitage - Thank you, minister, I appreciate it. 


Independent Regulator Findings of Reportable Conduct

Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER FOR EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[2.35 p.m.]
The 'Office of the Independent Regulator Annual Report' highlights there have been 567 total reports under the reportable conduct scheme for 2024-25. The average number of reports was 12 per week, compared to nine a week in the last reporting period, so reports are going up, not down. There have been 189 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=54.6_D=29.8_C=0.83]  reports from education services, which is 33 per cent of all reports. Of these, there were 57 reports of physical violence, 50 reports of sexual misconduct and 34 reports of grooming. Across all schools, 210 children and young people were alleged victims in a notification, and six of these were victims in more than one notification. The Independent Regulator said:

At the same time, we are also seeing significant shortfalls in core skills, a lack of quality [Bookmark: Phr5_O=84.7_D=29.6_C=0.70]  training and upskilling, and, disappointingly, a tendency to prioritise privacy over child safeguarding. Robust and consistent risk management practices, up-to-date and accessible policies and procedures, and a clear understanding of reporting obligations are not as prevalent or embedded as we would like. [checked] 

In broad terms, what is your response to the Independent Regulator's findings and the quite confronting data that she presents, and how will you respond [Bookmark: Phr6_O=114.6_D=11.0_C=0.73]  to that concern that your department has priorities that need to be straightened out?

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the honourable member for the question. I think there are some parts of your question that I will need to take on notice, and I will get back to you as soon as I can. Obviously, all complaints that are made by children and young people are taken very seriously, and they're investigated thoroughly, with the rights and safety of children and young people always at the centre.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=163.1_D=30.0_C=0.84] All DECYP staff are classified as mandatory reporters under our relevant legislation. This means that all staff must report known or suspected abuse of a child or a young person. All staff have access to clear information on how to report and complete mandatory online training annually. Complaints or allegations about staff conduct will always be referred to DECYP workplace relations if the code of conduct has been breached.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=194.3_D=28.9_C=0.83] We know that allegations of a serious nature result in the employee being removed from the workplace pending an investigation. An employee may be assigned alternative duties with no contact with the young person, so this does not occur when a complaint relates to an allegation of sexual abuse. The safety and wellbeing of young people involved is always central to these determinations, and a staff [Bookmark: Phr11_O=223.3_D=30.0_C=0.84]  member is only returned to the workplace when a thorough investigation process determines the safety and wellbeing of young children and young people is not at risk. 

With the rest of your question, I will need to take that on notice because it touched on a couple of different things, but one of the greatest strengths that we have, and something that I'm always asking questions about and focusing on, is making sure - and we [Bookmark: Phr12_O=253.4_D=29.8_C=0.81]  have certainly seen change in this space in a number of areas across the work from the commission of inquiry, even in the work that we're seeing with early childhood educators, in making sure that government does not operate in silos, and that there is always that cross-referencing and there is always that referral, because we know when there are silos, that's when children will slip through, and we cannot allow that to happen in our state.


Devonport Berth Construction - Cranes

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=285.0_D=2.7_C=0.69] Ms WEBB question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT
[2.39 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=289.7_D=4.8_C=0.78] My question is to follow up on one the minister for Infrastructure [Bookmark: Phr15_O=296.0_D=8.6_C=0.76]  agreed to take on notice earlier this week. My question is regarding the urgent construction works to finalise the Devonport berths for the new Spirit of Tasmania ferries. Can you confirm major industrial construction crane operators were requested as a matter of urgency to relocate those cranes from other sites around the state to Devonport to boost the progress of the ferry berth construction? If so, how many industrial cranes were requested to relocate for this purpose?

Are you aware of other infrastructure developments in other parts of the state impacted by the lack of ready access to crane operators due to prioritisation of berth works?

Further, if crane operators were requested to relocate, can you confirm who is bearing the costs: the government or the GBE involved? If the government is paying, at what cost?

ANSWER

Mr President, due to the detail required in that, I have sought a fair bit of extra information, but it is probably easier to answer as a whole instead of individually.

Firstly, I have no knowledge of any reprioritisation of cranes for the Terminal 3 site in Devonport, nor do TT-Line. As I'm aware, there are currently five large cranes on site at Terminal 3. Four of these large cranes are owned and operated by BMD, the lead contractor for the project. One additional large crane was recently locally sourced to fill and place rock bags, those are the quite large, couple-of-tonne rock bags they are stabilising the foreshore with to stop erosion. TT-Line has not sourced any cranes directly.

There may also be relatively small cranes on the site at various times at Terminal 3. From time to time, the subcontractors locally source these smaller cranes to BMD. The small cranes are not of a type that would be considered pivotal to a major infrastructure project. I have also consulted with the Department of State Growth, TT-Line and TasPorts, and I am not aware of any other infrastructure projects which have been impacted by the use of cranes on the Terminal 3 project.

I will add that it is exciting to hear the excitement around Devonport. There's nothing better than seeing cranes swinging around. Even Tim the Toolman loved it; it is good to see work happening with all the cranes on site. Thank you.


School Bus Services - Consideration of Extending Kingston Route

Ms WEBB question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

[2.42 p.m.]
Regarding school bus service within Spring Farm and Whitewater Park estates, which are in Kingston and part of my electorate, can you confirm that at the beginning of the 2025 school year the Department of State Growth engaged Wisby's Buses Pty Ltd to service Spring Farm and Whitewater Park estates for students at Kingston High and Kingston Primary schools, but unfortunately failed at the time to explore extending this new service to accommodate other non-government schools in the area, including St Aloysius Catholic College, which is attended by many children living in those suburbs?

Further, can you confirm that you've received correspondence from the college and parents, including supportive material from Wisby's Buses advising the company would be happy to implement a contract change as the required route change would add only an extra 7.6 kilometres each day, an additional four minutes to the current schedule, and could also accommodate children attending the Tarremah Steiner School nearby?

Given the demonstrated demand, the benefits, and the minimal impact of the current service, are you considering acting upon the request for a minor adjustment to the existing Kingston school bus route, and will you undertake to have done so in time for the commencement of the 2026 school year?


ANSWER

Mr President, I will seek some advice on that.

I will read some and then I have some other points that I'd like to add as well.

The Department of State Growth were not provided the opportunity to engage early on the Spring Farm and Whitewater Estate developments and were not able to provide advice on the public transport provision arrangements. The design of their estates makes it difficult to be serviced by public transport. State Growth is planning on installing new bus stops on the Channel Highway near Spring Farm Road to align with the planned shopping centre development, which will increase public transport access to estate residents and to existing Channel Highway bus routes.

However, service adjustments to divert existing Channel bus routes through the estates are not possible because of the significant disruption this would have on existing pasture and the highly integrated public transport network. The estates are currently serviced by two school bus routes to the Kingston Primary School, Kingston High School and Hobart College, as well as nearby government schools. The department is currently progressing the Greater Hobart Bus Network Review, which includes consideration of how best to provide Spring Farm and Whitewater Park communities with access to public bus services.

I will add, that I think myself, and it might have been the member for Huon, when we had a chat earlier on the week, that we received substantial and well written letters from some of the association people down there pointing out some of these things, which have only just arrived to the office quite recently and we're still working our way through them.


School Bus Services - Consideration of Extending Kingston Route

Ms WEBB question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

[2.47 p.m.]
To follow up on the previous question, I appreciate that information provided by the minister, but I wasn't asking about public transport to those suburbs - although it's good to hear that that's going to be looked at under the review. The specific question was about the school buses, which you did reference in your answer, that currently provide transport to school. It's a private bus company that transports children to school, going to Kingston Primary and Kingston High, and I believe what there's one for Hobart College.

The question relates to adjustments that have been requested to those Wisby Bus service routes to also be able to drop kids to school at St Aloysius and Tarremah Steiner School, which has been requested and apparently would comply with the State Growth school bus service eligibility guidelines. The parents, the schools and the bus company are all looking to make the change, but that hasn't necessarily been progressed by State Growth. I'm asking will you look at that and give it consideration ahead of the 2026 school year, to see if that can be accommodated with those existing school bus contracts?

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the member for clarification on that. I probably should have expanded on that last little bit some more, about the newness of the information received and I am happy to progress that through. I can't say that I'm fully across how that works, other than that State Growth handle those contracts as well and we will progress that. I am happy to come back to you, it won't be immediately because we've got to find out a little bit more information, which is what I hinted at, that we are working through it at the moment. I should note, the letters myself and the member for Huon received were very well written, in a lot of detail. It really was, it was very well done. We don't always see the level of detail it had in it. We have taken it very seriously.

Extra Funding for Various Children's Care Services

Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER for CHILDREN and YOUTH, Ms PALMER

[2.49 p.m.]
One of the features of this Budget - quite unusually so - is dotted blank lines in the out years. I refer you to Budget Paper 2, Vol. 1, page 25 and there's a number of programs within your portfolio responsibility, presumably, where extra allocations were made on the basis of unmet need. I ask, is it genuinely your intention as minister and the government's intention not to provide the extra money needed, for example, in foster and kinship care, intensive family engagement services, an uplift for out-of-home care needs, extra funding for school lunch programs, transition to independence funding. Were all those funding decisions approved by Cabinet, presumably, made on the basis that the unmet need will have been met by 2027-28, and no further funding will be required for those areas of your portfolio responsibility?

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the member for the question. I don't have my budget papers with me here. I can give you some examples looking at the foster and kinship carer uplift, which was an election commitment to increase the base by 15 per cent. There's a body of work that's being done at the moment that we need to consult on to look at if it is sufficient, is more required, what do we actually need to ensure that we have a really healthy and robust foster and kinship program in Tasmania?

One of the other ones you mentioned was healthy school lunches. From memory that is funded through to the end of the annual year next year, remembering schools don't go really in financial years. Again, there is a review that is happening around healthy school lunches, just to make sure that the initial policy, why we initially set out to roll-out healthy school lunches, that we are being true to that policy, and also because it has grown. There's just a couple, I'm going to use the word 'governance', issues, I think certainly not from healthy school lunches perspective at all, but we just need to step through those. There's a body of work that's happening around that and once that work's being done, my expectation is that you will see those decisions reflected in forwards.


JCP Youth Program - Funding

Ms THOMAS question to MINISTER for CHILDREN and YOUTH, Ms PALMER

[2.52 p.m.]
During the 2025 state election campaign, the government announced continued investment into diversionary programs such as JCP Youth, the creation of a statewide 'divert and connect' program and the establishment of a new youth hub in Glenorchy. My questions are specific to the JCP Youth program and are as follows:

What funding commitment has the government made to continued investment in the JCP Youth program in this Budget?

Is the government satisfied the JCP Youth Program is an evidence-based program?

Is the JCP Youth program founded on a therapeutic model of care? What evidence does the government have to demonstrate this?

Is JCP youth required to provide an evaluation report to the government demonstrating the outcomes achieved through the program? If so, has the government received an evaluation report to date?

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the member for the question.

The Tasmanian government is delivering on its commitment to support diversionary programs for at risk young people by investing in JCP Youth. The funding agreement between JCP Youth and the Department for Education, Children and Young People was signed in February 2025. Under this agreement, JCP Youth has been provided with $3.7 million over three years to expand the reach of its established and innovative BEAST program for up to 54 additional program placements for at risk young people statewide. In addition, this investment provides resources that enable JCP youth to engage a further 36 community-based referrals, broadening the program reach and impact. The organisation is focused on diversion practises for young males aged 11 to 17 years, who are at risk of becoming involved with or continuing to be involved with the Youth Justice System. The investment in JCP Youth and in local place-based initiatives provides diversion opportunities to prevent young people from offending or reoffending.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=5.5_D=15.0_C=0.80] JCP Youth is a well-established organisation offering an innovative and evolving diversionary service. JCP Youth BEAST Program is unlike any other service currently offered [Bookmark: Phr3_O=20.7_D=14.9_C=0.81]  by other providers in Tasmania. Evidence of individual outcomes success for young people participating in the JCP Youth BEAST Program is based on feedback, reports, testimonials, anecdotal  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=35.7_D=15.3_C=0.84] evidence, and observation from expert practitioners working with these young people. This process includes the feedback and observations from people working directly with JCP Youth BEAST participants in frontline support services. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=51.5_D=23.1_C=0.84]  The government continues to monitor compliance to ensure that JCP Youth fulfils all relevant regulatory and accreditation requirements and to ensure that all workers who have direct contact with and are responsible for the safety and well-being of participants have the appropriate qualifications, clearances and training to work with vulnerable young people.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=76.4_D=4.7_C=0.71] JCP youth is committed to providing a [Bookmark: Phr7_O=81.5_D=24.9_C=0.82]  safe and nurturing environment for all children and young people who access its services and to respect and uphold their rights. JCP Youth is linked with the centre for excellence and engaged in Australian childhood foundation training to ensure a therapeutic model of care is delivered. JCP Youth's programming is based on early intervention, engagement and relationship building. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=107.2_D=4.7_C=0.77]  JCP Youth is a relevant entity under the Child and Youth Safe Organisations [Bookmark: Phr9_O=112.2_D=25.6_C=0.81]  Act and is required to comply with the act to be a child safe organisation. This act is overseen by an independent regulator. JCP Youth operates under child protection policies including a child safe code of conduct aligned with the Child and Youth Safe Organisations' framework to safeguard young people and manage any concerns about child abuse. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=138.9_D=3.8_C=0.81] 

All JCP staff complete Australian Childhood Foundation [Bookmark: Phr11_O=143.0_D=25.2_C=0.80]  Safeguarding Children training, Introduction to Trauma and Trauma Informed Practise and DECYP safeguarding training for external providers schools along with Youth Mental Health First Aid. JCP Youth also has a formal complaints process enabling concerns to be raised both internally with JCP Youth and with independent regulators as appropriate. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=169.2_D=4.4_C=0.72]  JCP Youth must must escalate all reportable incidents [Bookmark: Phr13_O=174.1_D=15.9_C=0.86]  and where necessary, it will be investigated thoroughly by Tasmania Police and the Office of the Independent Regulator.

In the delivery of the BEAST Program, JCP Youth employs a mentoring and role modelling service model rather than a clinical approach. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=190.3_D=25.3_C=0.84]  The program integrates widely accepted behavioural techniques, including basic mindfulness and cognitive behavioural strategies to support participants' emotional regulation and self-awareness. JCP does not offer clinical therapy services. Instead, the organisation supports young people to engage with external clinical services as identified and needed. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=216.4_D=4.4_C=0.69]  JCP Youth has highlighted mindfulness and cognitive behavioural [Bookmark: Phr16_O=221.2_D=8.8_C=0.66]  therapy (CBT) as central components of its approach and delivery of the BEAST Program. 

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=234.9_D=24.0_C=0.80] The government acknowledges the importance of robust evaluation to ensure that funded programs deliver measurable and meaningful outcomes. JCP Youth is committed to working with the department to ensure continuous improvement of its innovative BEAST program. JCP Youth is actively supporting an independent evaluation process [Bookmark: Phr18_O=259.5_D=5.7_C=0.70]  which is being coordinated by the department. This evaluation will assess the BEAST programs' outcomes [Bookmark: Phr19_O=265.4_D=17.2_C=0.85]  in the lives of the participants and value for money. To ensure this commitment is maintained, the evaluation commitment is embedded into the funding agreement schedule with a requirement to be actioned within the term of the funding agreement between the Tasmanian government and JCP Youth. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=283.4_D=21.6_C=0.82] 

While formal evaluation outcomes are pending, participant outcomes are currently measured and monitored through internal tracking systems and personal and program assessments. Formal quarterly service delivery reports are provided to the department by JCP Youth. These quarterly reports include a sum of individual and group outcomes related to the BEAST program's current cohort of young people referred by the department.


RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

[3.00 p.m.]
Mr PRESIDENT - Before the member for Nelson makes her way to the floor, I welcome the second group from the Launceston Preparatory School who are touring parliament today.

We've just completed our Question Time, where members of the Legislative Council ask questions of the government or ministers. We have done that for half an hour, so now we're going into Orders of the Day, with members of the Legislative Council making contributions about the recent state Budget. That is the flavour of our debate and it's the member for Nelson's turn to speak.

I'm sure the member for Nelson, along with all other members in the Chamber, will make you welcome to our Chamber and thank you for visiting the Parliament of Tasmania.

Members - Hear, hear.


MOTION

Noting - Budget Papers 2025-26 and Appropriation Bills (No. 1 and No 2)

Resumed from above (page xx).

[3.01 p.m.]
Ms WEBB - Mr President, I was speaking about the government's decision to rely almost exclusively on cutting spending with minimal focus, if any, on investigating additional or alternative revenue sources, and this is despite the Treasurer's speech on the Budget stating, and I quote: (tbc 3.01)

Just 1 per cent change in the GST pool of Tasmania's relativity could result in revenue shifts of about $38 million to $20 million, respectively.

With further warnings delivered that the consequences of any such shift are very real, the Treasurer then went on to say the following, and I quote: (tbc 3.02)

Our fiscal strategy seeks to maintain a stable and diversified revenue base, ensuring that temporary fluctuations in one source, particularly federal government funding, do not undermine the delivery of essential services.

There we have it: a recognition of the need for a fiscal strategy focused on maintaining a stable and diversified revenue base. Imagine my surprise to hear the Treasurer on ABC Mornings radio last Friday, the day after the Budget was delivered, be dismissive of any talk of enhancing or diversifying locally raised income by stating, and again I quote from that radio interview: (tbc 3.02)

Even if the government were to increase taxes by 10 per cent across the board, it would represent a 3 per cent increase in revenue. That is marginal at best.

The statement infers that 3 per cent is somehow not worth the effort, but let's be clear then about what is not worth the effort. As the Treasurer's speech details, the total revenue for the general government sector for 2025-26 is estimated to be $9.5 billion dollars. Three per cent of $9.5 billion is approximately $284.9 million. Remember, the Treasurer's own speech warned that even a 1 per cent fluctuation in GST revenue presents real consequences. Therefore, surely, a potential 3 per cent increase in revenue could make as equally a real difference. Just to be very clear, I'm not advocating blindly for a blanket 10 per cent increase across our current state taxes. I hope my discussion point in this sense is not maliciously misrepresented somewhere else. Instead, I'm illustrating that if the state puts in the work and truly examined if our revenue base is sufficiently modern, equitable and diversified, even a small but sustainable revenue increase of a few percent can make a significant difference.

Try telling those young people still being abused at the Ashley Youth Detention Centre - because it remains open and in use, contrary to the commission of inquiry's explicit recommendation it be closed immediately - that the potential foregone, say $284 million, is not worth the effort. Try telling the TasTAFE Lab Tech students and teachers who are seeing that invaluable course be priced out of existence that potential income is not worth the effort to achieve. Or try telling TasTAFE Arts and Creative Industries students and teachers also facing extinction on dubious prioritisation grounds, seeing their accessible subsidies dry up virtually overnight. That would be a pittance in a small increase of our revenue. Or the Tasmanian National Preventative Mechanism, a responsibility under our Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture legislation who's issued repeated warnings it cannot meet its statutory obligations due to being critically underfunded and under-resourced. Or our invaluable Neighbourhood Houses around the state. Particularly, I'm going to mention my Kingston Neighbourhood House in my electorate which delivers crucial services and provides important avenues for community connection and social inclusion, but which is struggling to maintain essential facilities. The list could go on and on.

Of course we can't do all of those things, but significant things can be done, even with a small percentage increase in our own revenue sources in this state. As Saul Eslake recently commented on the interim Budget:[tbc]

If the government had actually made a start on a combination of revenue and expenditure measures in today's interim Budget, there would have been a better chance. The fruits of doing so [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.2_D=15.3_C=0.86] , in terms of a more credible and sustainable trajectory for the key budget numbers presented in today's budget papers, would become apparent before the next election, whenever that might be. 

In particular, whilst acknowledging that raising taxes is  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=45.7_D=20.0_C=0.85] an especially difficult choice for a Liberal government, there would have been more time to explain the need for such choices to the electorate, and perhaps a greater opportunity to foreshadow some tax relief at the next election by getting Tasmania's finances on a more sustainable footing before then. These opportunities and others have been foregone.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=66.5_D=29.9_C=0.88] To reiterate, meaningful fiscal structural reform and budget repair require both revenue and expenditure to be seriously and equitably reviewed and addressed. This is more than a missed opportunity in my book: it's an irresponsible refusal to seize the opportunity. This power-sharing parliament is potentially the best chance in decades to attempt to break the bipartisan fiscal structural reform inertia and to put paid to the inevitable, childish 'who [Bookmark: Phr5_O=96.5_D=18.0_C=0.77]  will blink first', when it comes to modernising and diversifying our state taxation and revenue base. As Mr Eslake said, 'Those opportunities and others have been foregone.' It is the Tasmanian people, particularly the most vulnerable among us, who are going to pay the price big time.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=118.6_D=23.9_C=0.83] I previously mentioned our recent discussions in this place regarding how to improve parliament scrutiny and input and input of the executive when it comes to financial management and budget. Given the Treasurer referred to his multi-party panel during his budget speech, I think it's appropriate to canvass other and more inclusive options for consideration in this response I'm giving today. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=142.9_D=25.6_C=0.84]  

Some members here may recall that once upon a time this parliament used to have another joint committee, the Working Arrangements Committee. The principle role of that committee was to examine and recommend to both Houses measures which may improve the performance and efficiency of the parliament. That committee provided a transparent, accountable mechanism by which proposals to improve parliamentary workings were discussed, including breaking any legislative deadlocks between the two Chambers, for example [Bookmark: Phr8_O=169.3_D=5.1_C=0.79] . Advice from stakeholders was sought to inform those discussions and recommendations made and reported to parliament for consideration.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=175.6_D=11.0_C=0.84] As an example of the fruits of that committee, in 1998 that committee tabled a report reviewing and recommending the permanent establishment of government business enterprise scrutiny committees [Bookmark: Phr10_O=187.3_D=25.8_C=0.81] , something that hadn't been present before and now is a part of our architecture of scrutiny here. It would be a useful move for this parliament to consider reconvening something like the Working Arrangements of Parliament Joint Committee, particularly to then examine the most appropriate and effective mechanisms available to our Westminster parliament to have input into and scrutinise fiscal and budgetary decisions made by the government of the day. It would be an appropriate parliamentary mechanism. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=214.0_D=4.7_C=0.78]  For example, I'd like to see such a committee examine the proposal that I've spoken about [Bookmark: Phr12_O=219.0_D=30.0_C=0.84]  at various times: that we could look at how to better improve our Estimates processes. 

I like the idea, and think it should be examined for value, of having two sets of Estimates sessions annually. For example: one set of Estimates linked to the state budget, focused narrowly on budget numbers and fiscal indicators, and at a separate time, timed to occur after the tabling of departmental annual reports, another set of estimates specifically focusing on examining policy positions [Bookmark: Phr13_O=249.3_D=24.1_C=0.81] , indicators and outcomes as reflected in those annual reports. That's a model that has been adopted in New Zealand, and it would be worth considering its appropriateness for our jurisdiction. 

It would give us two chances to scrutinise the government, both on their investment through the budget, but also on their policy outcomes that are being delivered and reported in annual reports. It's just an idea. My point is we should be setting up a mechanism that we can [Bookmark: Phr14_O=274.2_D=4.4_C=0.88]  look at and examine a range of ideas about how we can strengthen our scrutiny in this place [Bookmark: Phr15_O=279.1_D=1.6_C=0.94]  and be very active in doing so. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=282.6_D=5.0_C=0.84]  I would hope to participate in that sort of process, certainly putting forward ideas for consideration [Bookmark: Phr17_O=288.9_D=16.1_C=0.81] .

Even as a more straightforward first step in relation to our current arrangements, I would argue that in the interests of more effective scrutiny, there's a case for each House to have separately scheduled budget Estimates scrutiny hearings on successive weeks, rather than have them held concurrently. I'm convinced that we should be looking at the scope and the powers also of our existing committees, especially our joint standing and sessional committees, and asking ourselves how they may be improved in their operation and potentially the strength and breadth of what they do.

One of our jobs here is to be considering how we can better undertake our key role of scrutiny of the executive on behalf of the Tasmanian people. Mechanisms for that consideration should be built into our parliamentary structures and should be an active matter of interest and endeavour for all members. I hope that in this place we see a further and ongoing, active consideration of opportunities to improve our capacity for effective scrutiny.

Something to add here, actually, is just to note the purpose of our scrutiny. It's not to be shouting into a void. We actually need an informed electorate so at crunch time when a government presents itself for re-election, an informed and educated citizenry can be making decisions about how well that government has done and whether they want to vote them back in or not. It's our job here to be constantly providing information and bringing it into the public domain so that the community can have the information they need to make that decision when they vote.

Our scrutiny has a purpose beyond just what happens in this place, but ripples out to the community to help our democracy function in the way it should, so voters can hold governments to account, ultimately, at the ballot box when they're placing their vote. That decision should be made on an informed assessment by the voter of how well the government has delivered on its mandate as an executive.

To move on from those potential budgetary oversight reforms and ways that we can think about improving our scrutiny, I'd now like to focus on some key areas that I regard as important to highlight in relation to our state budget. I will speak about things that I do typically talk about in terms of a normal budget, because although this is what the Treasurer called an 'interim Budget', that doesn't mean we shouldn't be looking at it as thoroughly as we would a 'normal budget'.

A policy area that I regularly speak about in relation to the state budget is that of housing and homelessness. I do that because having a secure, affordable long-term home is the essential basis to a decent life. The lack of that is not only what is holding so many Tasmanians back; it's holding our whole state back, and it will be a brake on budget repair.

I believe all members here will have received Anglicare's quarterly housing report for the July to September quarter this year. That report is grim reading. It tells us there has been a 34 per cent increase in the number of Tasmanians seeking housing support from the Housing Connect Front Door in that quarter. There's been an 88 per cent increase in the number of people sleeping rough. There's been a 54 per cent increase in people living in inadequate or substandard dwellings. 

Strikingly, it states that some Tasmanians are living in conditions more commonly seen in developing countries, for example: substandard dwellings, including sheds without running water, bathroom facilities or kitchens. The report speaks to the fact that the number of children in families seeking housing support has grown by 60 per cent. These are really striking and disturbing numbers: increases of 88 per cent for sleeping rough; 54 per cent for inadequate and substandard dwellings; and a 60 per cent increase in the number of children in families seeking support.

This is desperation. All the government does in response to these sorts of grim tidings from the sector is parrot a line that people should 'contact Housing Connect Front Door and she'll be right,' as if that's some sort of solution or end in itself, and we know full well it's not. Meanwhile, the Housing Connect staff, who I have the utmost respect for because they provide a caring and supporting service and they're professional about doing it, are simply unable to offer what most clients presenting to them need: a secure, stable, affordable home.

We've had 11 years of failure from this government on providing that most basic need to its citizens. SARC modelling (the Social Action and Research Centre at Anglicare) suggests that we will see approximately 14,000 Tasmanians waiting for social housing by 2032. That's not very far down the track. It's seven years from now. Seven years ago we were in 2018, and that's not very far behind us. 2032 is not very far ahead of us and 14,000 Tasmanians are projected to be on the social housing waiting list by that time, and that's calculating in the government's little litany of things that they're apparently attempting to do in this space.

So many people are being driven onto that social housing waiting list because they're falling out of the private rental market, as this housing crisis, which is what we called it in 2018, has now grown to a life-defining emergency in this state in 2025.

The private rental market is the housing tenure the government has utterly neglected to act on in any meaningful way. Our private rental market is in catastrophic market failure and, as Anglicare plainly says in its report, government intervention is urgently needed. With the critically low vacancy rates across the state, largely it's well below 1 per cent, and no meaningful brake that is able to be applied to rent increases in this state, we see rents outpacing wages by at least 15 per cent. It's virtually impossible for a young adult to move out of home in this state into a rental property, even a share house. It is impossible for a person or a family on welfare support to rent affordably in this state if they're trying to enter the private rental market.

People who are fortunate enough to be in rentals already are terrified they will be evicted at the end of their current lease, which can happen without any reason at all because we have failed to keep up with contemporary practise and prevent no fault evictions like every other state has. This terror stops tenants making maintenance requests or raising issues that might put them on their landlord's radar for eviction at the end of the lease.

And while we recently passed in this place the pets in rental legislation, which on paper expands the rights of tenants when it comes to having a pet, in the context of catastrophic market failure in the private rental market, all tenants' rights become much harder to assert and protect.

The Anglicare report asks the question - do we have the right response to reality? The answer has to be a resounding no. Indicators are all going in the wrong direction. We are running away from reality here and that's to the detriment of the most vulnerable amongst us in our community.

Housing is a foundation to all other aspects of a good life, health, education, family, community participation, employment and on and on. Because of the Liberal government's failure on housing, the challenges are greater, and the costs are higher in our health system, in education system, in community services system and our criminal justice system. The government response to this sort of assertion being made or put before them is to simply give us a laundry list of things that they're doing in the housing space. That's utterly meaningless. It's not delivering the results.

Half-hearted efforts like the Family Violence Rapid Rehousing Program and the Private Rental Incentive Scheme have failed to make any tangible difference. They have not achieved the outcomes needed. They are at best busy work from this government, not solutions.

The data doesn't lie, this is a situation that has radically deteriorated under their watch. It is this Liberal government's failure, and it is their responsibility. The story has always been the same when it comes to housing. The government can do more and it isn't.

Ms O'Connor - They choose not to.

Ms WEBB - That's exactly right. Not only are we not building enough housing of all tenure types, but importantly, the government are pulling none of the levers that would make a palpable difference in the private rental market.

No doubt, the siloed approach contributes to this because we have our Residential Tenancy Act, the primary legislation to address matters in the private rental market, under the responsibility of a different minister to the Minister for Housing and Homelessness, whose portfolio is feeling the most ferocious effects of the failure to act on private rental market reform.

We need to comprehensively reform our Residential Tenancy Act and as key priorities deliver stronger guardrails on rent increases and like every other state, get rid of no fault evictions at the end of leases. The continued failure to address these two things has been a key driver of the massive increase in homelessness in Tasmania over the terms of this Liberal government.

We also need to address the decimation of our private rental market by short stay accommodation with meaningful regulation and controls at a local government level. We see this government's failure writ large in the relentless rise in the number of Tasmanians on the waiting list for social and public housing. Every single one of those applicants is an indictment on this government.

Homes Tasmania is looking more and more like a failed experiment. It has confirmed the fears that were stated when the legislation came through this place to form it: that it would be less effective to take the responsibilities out of a government department and would be an exercise in keeping accountability at arm's length. The damning review of Homes Tasmania released in June, is an admission that it isn't working as planned. Already we've seen strategic housing policies shifted back into Department of State Growth.

Another area of particular interest and concern to me is the implementation of the commission of inquiry recommendations. In speaking on this topic here today, I'm going to note that today is National Survivors Day, 12 November. This day recognises and commemorates the courage and journeys of survivors of sexual assault and institutional abuse, their supporters and whistleblowers across Australia. In that spirit, I state here my acknowledgement of those who are victim/survivors of sexual assault and institutional abuse; and those whistleblowers who have tirelessly and at great personal cost fought to see the truth brought to light. In particular, I honour those who, through their courage and commitment, caused the commission of inquiry to be established; and whose contributions made that commission of inquiry such a watershed moment in our state.

The implementation of recommendations from the commission of inquiry is an ongoing piece of work. One that is occupying a great deal of time and attention across various departments, and rightly so.

I will also take the opportunity to acknowledge there are many, many public servants across those departments who are working with care and conviction to deliver on both the letter and the spirit of the commission of inquiry recommendations. This is complex work, and when coupled with the significant cultural change that has been identified as necessary, to bring about real improvement in the safety of children in our state, it is a mountain we are all climbing together. Thank you, to those public servants who are driving and contributing to this shared task.

To speak in some detail on some matters from the Budget in relation to implementation of commission of inquiry recommendations. I will mention a few to put on the record. I note there is $15.8 million over four years for independent statutory bodies like the Commission for Children and Young People, the Office of the Independent Regulator and the Office of the Independent Monitor. It's very positive to have oversight bodies in place, as a result of these recommendations. It's crucial for ensuring the recommendations are implemented and are effectively working to deliver the outcome of greater safety for Tasmanian children.

I do have to ask - which we will explore in more detail next week no doubt during Estimates - is the funding allocated enough for them to undertake their statutory roles? We do have a history and habit in this state, from this government, of underfunding oversight entities. That's something to be interrogated carefully. I note there's $500,000 for the office of the Tasmanian National Preventative Mechanism, under our OPCAT obligations. I am yet to understand whether this is going to be enough to provide for them to actually do their job, this time around. Certainly, in May, they weren't provided with sufficient funding to actually do their role, just enough funding to exist on paper.

There is $155.3 million allocated for the new youth detention facility at Pontville. This is such a controversial project. We've spoken here a lot - I'm not going to dwell on it in detail today - but we do need to be closing AYDC as a matter of urgency. It was a matter of urgency two years ago, when the commission of inquiry brought down their final report. It remains a matter of urgency now two years down the track.

It is still not clear what the new Pontville youth detention facility's final cost will be. It is going through the planning system, which is positive in terms of progress. There are still significant criticisms about the model of care. It's certainly a different facility and model of care to what was outlined in the commission of inquiry recommendations and more needs to be unpicked in that space.

I am concerned that with the brutal cuts we've had foreshadowed, that must come in the next state budget and onwards, under this government's approach to budget repair. I am quite afraid we will see 'savings' - I say that in inverted commas - made in the way the new facility is put in place, developed, and then operated. That would be absolutely tragic to see. It would undermine the whole intent of a new model of youth detention and the therapeutic approach it's supposed to be taking. That's to be examined with eagle eyes and a continued, very active watching brief. I am pleased we have a committee that's tasked with particularly scrutinising these recommendations as they are rolled out.

I also note in the Budget $4 million to support community youth justice, including $1.5 million over two years to support new, local place-based initiatives targeting the root causes of youth offending. That's positive. It's optimistic, I believe, to focus on preventative measures in the community. It's what we need. My concern is that we must ensure that the investments are made in services and supports that are evidence-based and accountable and don't present risks in and of themselves. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=32.1_D=4.6_C=0.84]  I will be carefully looking at the intention of how that money is to be spent.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=38.4_D=23.9_C=0.83] I was pleased to not see more irresponsible election promises made about funding into this space in the most recent election. As we've seen in elections past, this is an area of public policy that should never be the subject of reckless election commitments and promises. It is always something that should be approached with absolute rigour and services designed [Bookmark: Phr5_O=62.7_D=12.7_C=0.85] , developed, tendered and then appointed through an absolutely rigorous process to get us the best services for the best outcomes, for the most accountability and greater safety of our children.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=77.0_D=14.4_C=0.80] I note out-of-home care and foster and kinship carers have had some uplift in this Budget. That's positive. I am concerned though, and I know we had some discussion just in our Question Time today, about the uplift for foster and kinship carers. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=92.2_D=30.0_C=0.86]  It's for one year, recognising that there's a process underway to more comprehensively assess where to from here in terms of support for foster and kinship carers, which is great to have that review process, but the assumption would have to be that it is going to tell us we need to pay them more than they're currently being paid. 

While the Budget does indicate the one-year uplift while the review happens, the fact that there's nothing in the forward Estimates is just a little device to make the budget look better in the forward Estimates, because we do [Bookmark: Phr8_O=122.2_D=5.7_C=0.90]  have to assume there will be more funding needed in this space across those forward Estimates as a result of the review. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=130.0_D=6.8_C=0.61]  Otherwise, the government's basically admitting, no, it's a one-year, 15 per cent boost, and then we just go back to what we were doing before.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=141.6_D=20.8_C=0.83] I was surprised and wondered about the particular mention in the budget papers about the Intensive Family Engagement Service. It is an important part of our child safety service. It provides support for families who are assessed as experiencing complex issues that directly impact on the safety of children [Bookmark: Phr12_O=163.2_D=0.5_C=0.66] , and [Bookmark: Phr13_O=165.7_D=26.0_C=0.82]  the Budget points to funding of $4 million a year for two years, which is apparently to continue the IFES services, up to 88 packages. 

Again, I'm not sure why it's detailed there, if this is new funding or not. We will dig into that in Estimates. It looks to me like it's a continuation of existing funding, but again, in the forward Estimates: nothing. Two years' worth of funding and then blank, blank across the out years of the forward Estimates. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=192.1_D=18.0_C=0.82]  I don't understand in the first place why it's an announcement, to be funding that service which is already funded. It doesn't seem to be that it's new funding or even necessarily additional funding, and it certainly drops away in the forward Estimates just so we get that better-looking bottom line in year 3 and 4. So that's one for looking at. 

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=211.0_D=24.2_C=0.86] One of the things that I always look to after a budget is the comments that are provided by the representative bodies in different spaces of policy. I did look at the Youth Network of Tasmania (YNOT) budget comments, and I'm going to read a quote from the comments they made about this Budget after it had been brought down last week. This is what YNOT partly said in their statement:[tbc]

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=236.5_D=29.4_C=0.83] We welcome the continued investment in implementing the commission of inquiry recommendations, including the establishment of the new Commissioner for Children and Young People, the Office of the Implementation Monitor and the funding of out-of-home care and youth justice initiatives. 

And it goes on to say:

Of particular concern in the budget papers is the consolidation of funding for the delivery of the commission of inquiry recommendations and the Child and Youth Wellbeing Strategy. Without transparent allocation of these funds, it remains unclear how the government intends to meet its policy commitments to young [Bookmark: Phr17_O=266.0_D=7.8_C=0.79]  Tasmanians. YNOT will be actively seeking clarification on these budget allocations to ensure that promises translate into real outcomes.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=274.6_D=11.8_C=0.77] I will certainly be endeavouring to assist YNOT in that task of trying to make sense of these allocations and look for transparency that at the moment isn't apparent.  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=289.7_D=6.4_C=0.82] I'm always going to have a keen interest in the health and sustainability of our community services industry in Tasmania. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=297.0_D=8.0_C=0.81]  This is the industry I worked in prior to coming to this place, and it remains close to my heart. I hold it dear, not just out of a sense of nostalgia, though, but because I'm acutely aware of how fundamentally important it is to our state. The community services industry is the glue that holds our communities and our state together. The viability of this industry is a key determinant of health, employment and social cohesion across our state. I believe it's useful to have a clear picture of this industry and the magnitude of the task it faces, given the vastly inadequate funding it receives.

This industry has 28,000 workers; the community service industry is a huge employer in our state. It is doing work to support our community, and some of the challenges that it is endeavouring to assist us with in this state, and to solve the issues of, include the fact that 81,500 Tasmanians - I will just say that again: 81,500 Tasmanians are living below the poverty line,14 per cent of us. This has risen 16 per cent in two years.

We also have 50,000 Tasmanians experiencing energy poverty. One in three Tasmanian households are food insecure. There is now an absolute record of 5336 applicants on the priority social housing wait list in September this year, and the average wait times for those applicants is more than 18 months. We've had the sector note a 34 per cent rise in people seeking housing support, and an 88 per cent rise in rough sleeping just in this last quarter's report. These are desperate numbers, and it is our community services industry that is on the frontline of addressing these needs and these challenges for us.

The community services industry went into this Budget, and the election that preceded it, with some really basic funding asks. It was seeking to be supported in this Budget by having funding certainty provided through five-year contracts, appropriate indexation and outcomes-based frameworks around funding. They were looking for an industry sustainability program with standard contracts, reduced reporting, streamlined processes and shared services. They were looking for a 10-year update, and funding for a 10-year update of the state of Tasmania's community services industry report, and they're also looking for a midterm review of the Community Services Industry Plan 2021-31.

That's what they went into the Budget asking for. It's pretty modest, actually, for a peak body of the industry that employs 28,000 workers in this state and faces the challenges on our behalf that I've just described. What did they get out of the Budget? After having those very modest and basic funding asks presented, the key announcement for the community service industry was $150,000 for a community services sustainability initiative. None of those other things were delivered on, effectively, for this industry, for our state. That's just shameful. I use that word a lot, and it probably loses its potency in overuse, but I just can't think of another way to describe it.

These are people who are working on the frontline. These are people who go above and beyond every single day with people who are in the most desperate of circumstances, and often it's at great personal cost to the 28,000 workers in this industry, and they have basically been given a slap in the face through this Budget, and we're looking ahead to horror in the next one coming. TasCOSS has said in response to Thursday's Budget:

We remain concerned at the level of debt we are taking on to fund infrastructure projects that could be deferred and the impact this has on the amount of funding available to deliver essential services to Tasmanians. Community services represent a small fraction of the state's total budget, but this investment prevents the need for higher expenditure across other portfolios such as Health, Justice and Education.

As we look to the budget next year, we urge the Treasurer to take a balanced approach to budget repair by considering a mix of revenue-raising and targeted investment that prevents costly crises, not through cuts that guarantee them. Community services are not a 'nice to have'. Government expenditure should be prioritised to deliver essential services and support to Tasmanians that will enable them to fully participate in our economy.

The community sector is already underfunded, with demand for support far outstripping what can be delivered by service providers. This is an industry already going above and beyond what they're funded to provide. It is guaranteed, absolute rock solid, guaranteed that cuts to other service areas, whether that's health, education, criminal justice, whatever we choose to cut, it will drive demand into our Community Services sector. That means that any cuts directly to the Community Services sector in coming budgets will be a false economy because this is a sector will need more in the future, not less. Now is the time for greater investment, not cuts to the Community Services industry.

Cuts will inevitably mean that the first things jettisoned will be long term prevention and early intervention programs. Those are what will be neglected. For example, in the area of family and sexual violence services and support, I did note the Tasmanian Family and Sexual Violence Alliance said that the interim Budget does not meet the scale of the state's family and sexual violence crisis being experienced. They're warning that rising demand, growing wait lists and stagnant investment continue to leave women and children unsafe. In comments on the Budget, the Tasmanian Family and Sexual Violence Alliance said this, and I'll quote, it's a longish quote, Mr President, and I wanted it here on the record because it explains how, by failing to to sufficiently fund, particularly prevention services, we are digging a hole for ourselves. That is just horrific. The quote from the alliance is this:[tbc]

Reports of family violence have risen by nearly 70 per cent over the past five years and sexual violence by 180 per cent. Yet funding to specialist support services has not shifted to match that demand. This Budget doesn't meet the scale of the crisis. We're seeing demand rising and funding for specialist family and sexual violence services flat. Women and children are waiting months, sometimes years for support. Our frontline Family Violence Services report women are having to wait far too long. Sexual Violence Services report significant wait times for survivors to access much needed trauma counselling, including victim-survivors of child sexual abuse. Women experiencing family and sexual violence are increasingly self-representing in court because they cannot access specialised legal services.

We are also hearing from the sector that critical investment is needed in services to support children and young people impacted by family violence, in programs that educate children on respectful relationships, along with dedicated support for Aboriginal women, an investment in dedicated housing including crisis accommodation, transition, and long-term homes. This must be met with a sustainable and skilled workforce to meet rising demand. Tasmania has the chance to prevent harm and reduce demand, but that requires sustained investment, not only short-term crisis responses. Every Tasmanian deserves to live safely and with dignity and agency. (TBC)

In this Budget, and looking ahead to the next Budget and the measures foreshadowed to be in it, we can see that those punished most severely will be Tasmanians doing it most tough. We all know the essential services, supports and community building done by Neighbourhood Houses in our local communities. Those same essential community supports are at risk with the peak body Neighbourhood Houses Tasmania commenting on this Budget:

The Tasmanian Government has maintained the same level of funding for Neighbourhood Houses in this Budget, but this level of funding is not safe or sustainable. Neighbourhood Houses are resilient but have their limits. Our houses, people and volunteers are being stretched to breaking point. We continue to work with Government to find solutions to ensure Tasmanians don't lose an essential community infrastructure. Neighbourhood Houses are the trusted local hubs at the heart of Tasmanian communities, open to everyone, always. Every week they provide connection, learning and vital support to over 28,000 Tasmanians. (TBC)

We are taking our Neighbourhood Houses in this state for granted. This Budget takes our Neighbourhood Houses for granted. Politicians love nothing more than to turn up at Neighbourhood Houses for a feel-good photo opportunity to pop onto the socials, but when it comes to funding from this Government, they get scraps and window dressing. We've got Neighbourhood Houses closing services in all areas of our state. In some cases, they're falling apart at the seams. The Kingston Neighbourhood House in my patch, which leaks through the light fittings when it rains, and has to send staff home. This is the way we are taking our Neighbourhood Houses for granted. It's not good enough, and importantly, because we're talking about the Budget, it's false economy to be underfunding these supports in our community.

This has been described by TasCOSS as a 'treading-water budget'. My fear though, for the community sector, is that it will be 'treading water' in shark-infested oceans with an armada of fins coming towards them in the May 2026 state Budget. I fear for the result in our communities.

Moving on, I take this opportunity once again to restate my very firm position that the Premier of this state should hold the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. Reconciliation with the traditional owners of Lutruwita, this island home, should be an ongoing top priority as a state and as a community. It requires the gravitas of the elected leader of the state, in the form of the Premier, to take on that responsibility. I do not understand the reasoning behind removing Aboriginal Affairs from DPAC, when it was shifted in November 2024 to the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania. That sent a bad message, I believe.

While I welcome the commitment to establish a commissioner for aboriginal children and young people as was recommended by the commission of inquiry, we have learned the hard way here that it will take continual vigilance to ensure the new commissioner is adequately resourced and empowered to fulfil its role. Further, I note that the Budget papers pronounce the increase of funding to a select few important Aboriginal heritage programs and the long-awaited funding for the Aboriginal Land Council of Tasmania that it requires to ensure that entity can fulfil its mandated core administrative obligations - all of which are welcome and necessary. However, table 9.2 of Budget Paper Volume 1 shows that the Output Group 6's initial increase for 2025-26 then drops away over the forward Estimates.

We've got a familiar song we're singing here: an initial bit of funding in this Budget and perhaps for the following year, and then nothing in the forward Estimates. What are we to interpret by that? Is suddenly the need to do basic administration by, say, the Aboriginal Land Council, going to fall away in years three and four of this Budget? Not likely. We're either going to be cutting them to ribbons then with a drop in funding, or we're going to be putting more money into the Budget. No wonder we're not wanting to put it there now, because that would disrupt the very misleading narrative that the Treasurer is trying to paint about a pathway - a 'glide pathway' apparently, to better times.

It's a grave concern to see a similar drop-off in funding over the forward Estimates for the Closing the Gap and other Aboriginal projects, which is detailed in table 11.1 of Budget Paper 2 Volume 1. I'm deeply uncomfortable, actually, with the clustering of the Closing the Gap - which I regard as a fundamental human rights delivery program and an obligation on our state - the clustering of that with a line item summarised as 'other Aboriginal projects'. It's arguable that a government genuine about turning around its current poor track record on meeting Closing the Gap obligations would have a separate line item or even an output group dedicated to Closing the Gap. I recognise that not all benchmark obligations will translate into a financial or budgetary representation, but it would help this parliament and the community to track exactly what the government is investing in Closing the Gap if it was in fact in its own line item. Currently, the fact that it's rolled into a line item consisting of other Aboriginal projects conveniently muddies those financial waters.

However, the decrease in funding over the forward Estimates for that particular line item raises concerns that the Closing the Gap funding is set to decrease. That's the only thing we can interpret from that: absence of funding in years three and four. How on earth can the government even pretend it's trying to turn around our shameful failure to meet those agreed Closing the Gap obligations? The other inconvenient truth which I refuse to allow the government to conveniently forget is the commitment it made to progressing truth-telling and treaty. This has to happen. It will happen, eventually. The '2021 Pathway to Truth-Telling and Treaty report' should be a fixture in our annual budgets until its 24 recommendations are implemented and the treaty is signed and delivered. Imagine how far some additional raised revenue could make - even a portion of the hypothetical 3 per cent the Treasurer was so scornful about on radio - if it was invested in the delivery of the 'Pathway to Truth-Telling and Treaty report' recommendations. It will be the government's decision as to which side of history it will find itself on. Sadly, from a position where it could have been a historic leader in genuine reconciliation of truth-telling and treaty, this government has instead now slunk into the shadows of spineless ignominy.

It's very telling that the week we see many political and community leaders heading to COP30 in Brazil and when international scientific and climate experts are warning of dire consequences should we fail to meet the climate challenge, we see significant cuts made to our climate change funding in this Budget. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=15.8_D=18.0_C=0.82] 

It appears the output group 7.2 in Budget Paper 2 Volume 1, Climate Change, suffers a decrease it would appear of $411,000 for the 2025-26 year, and then a further funding cut of 29 per cent in the forward Estimates for 2026-27. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=34.3_D=28.1_C=0.82]  The paucity of detail here in the Budget makes it unclear as to what impact these cuts will have or where what exactly they're going to be doing. What does that mean for the Climate Change Office, for example? In 2024-25 statutory independent review of the Climate Change State Action Act 2008 is currently underway, with its final report expected by the end of this year. It would appear from these budget papers the government is either not expecting recommendations which have any degree of financial component [Bookmark: Phr4_O=63.1_D=1.9_C=0.69] , or does not intend to implement [Bookmark: Phr5_O=65.4_D=29.3_C=0.84]  any recommendations made by the independent review?

Again, we're seeing the false juxtaposition of the green economy and climate ambition versus economic growth. In contrast, recent analysis from the OECD and the UN Development Program shows that stepping up and engaging consistently with public and private sectors and communities strengthens rather than weakens economic growth and and prosperity. We should be acting on climate change. It will be to our financial detriment ultimately that we don't. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=95.2_D=3.3_C=0.90]  Climate action is not just about setting lower emissions targets.

Ms O'Connor - Higher emissions reductions targets.

Ms WEBB - There you go, but also about weaving that necessary transition to all our economic and social strategies. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=112.6_D=19.6_C=0.86]  This means aligning climate action with plans to expand opportunity, to improve health, to raise living standards, to build houses. The benefits can be substantial. The reality is that increased investment in clean technologies, improved energy efficiency and strategic reinvestment of carbon revenues needs to be at the centre of our economic policy development and planning.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=132.9_D=19.2_C=0.80] Yet here we are with this interim budget taking our foot off the electric pedal. A proportion of that hypothetical 3 per cent of additional revenue could make a considerable difference to reprioritising the state's investment in positioning us as leaders in the climate change research, preparedness and climate justice areas.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=156.3_D=3.7_C=0.90] Another key measure by which we should assess the state budget [Bookmark: Phr11_O=161.1_D=2.7_C=0.88]  is what they tell us about the government of the [Bookmark: Phr12_O=165.6_D=29.8_C=0.78]  day's approach to maintaining or even strengthening our democratic integrity and oversight mechanisms. These interim budget papers tell us a lot. A grudging we'll do the least necessary approach is very evident in these budget papers. A grudging minimal approach. The ombudsman, the role of many hats in this state received a minor but welcome operational line-item boost for 2025 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=195.6_D=8.7_C=0.77] -26, but this is quickly eroded over the forward Estimates, which projects that vital oversight organ receives less than it's currently struggling to survive upon.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=204.9_D=14.6_C=0.72] The Tasmanian NPM, our OPCAT obligation, despite having significant statutory responsibilities under the OPCAT laws, the national preventative mechanism is provided a measly financial boost for the 2025-26 year and the same the 2026-27 forward Estimates [Bookmark: Phr15_O=219.9_D=25.0_C=0.80] , after which that particular funding drops off a cliff. Surprise, surprise. We sing the same song again, despite it providing to government a detailed implementation plan identifying its operational needs in order to comply with its statutory obligations. That does not seem evident in this budget. The Integrity Commission, another independent oversight entity which has resorted to stating publicl [Bookmark: Phr16_O=245.8_D=3.9_C=0.58] y its underfunding is impacting upon its capacity to fulfil its obligations and do its job [Bookmark: Phr17_O=250.4_D=6.8_C=0.78] , another minor boost for the 2025-26 year, but the forward Estimate projections have it receiving less than it does currently.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=257.8_D=29.7_C=0.78] The Audit Office, an integral public probity office, most people would concur, an office that delivers more than just opinions. This is our statutory entity set up to do expert assessments and audits of our financial situations, the government entities and GBEs, et cetera. This is not an office that is just any Joe Blow out in the street offering an opinion and it should never be dismissed as such.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=288.6_D=16.4_C=0.83] A member of parliament, whoever that member of parliament may be, should not be dismissive of a statutory entity like our Audit Office and the information provided by the audits that it does of our organs of government, our GBEs and our state-owned companies. To dismiss a very serious finding of our Audit Office is unparliamentary.

Back to the Audit Office in the Budget. A small office it is which routinely punches above its weight with professional advice and public financial accountability outputs. Yet again, it is to experience a decrease in funding immediately after this interim budget, followed by further cuts over the forward Estimates. At a time when there are growing calls for greater, clearer and more robust financial and property scrutiny, premier independent entities funding is being continually curtailed, it would seem. This deliberate policy implementation tells us a lot about the government's priorities and attitudes to scrutiny. While this government likes to claim that it is the most transparent and accountable government ever - which sounds quite like Monty Python to me - it certainly does not intend to have properly functioning independent entities if we go by what is in this Budget.

RTI reforms: moving on to other important scrutiny and transparency measures. Of further concern, is the lack of provision for the implementation of the significant recent Getting Back on Track, independent review of Tasmania's Right to Information framework undertaken by Professor Tim McCormack, and Adjunct Associate Professor Rick Snell. I don't see that in this Budget, we've done this sterling work with these two august professionals, and we don't seem to be intending to fund the implementation of its recommendations. It is yet to be interrogated in Estimates.

The Woolcott Review: we know that there are a range of recommendations forthcoming from the independent Woolcott Review, some of which will have budget implications. Such as, for example: its strategic recommendation 5.4 that a new Commissioner of the State Service be established. Yet, in the interim budget papers, there appears to be silence on any forward planning or provision to act on these significant recommendations coming out of the Woolcott Review.

I want to point out that these policy decisions to keep our integrity and oversight entities chained to a bare minimum financial drip feed, does have enormous fiscal ramifications. As budget paper vol. 1 states: (tbc 3.52)

The scope of the state's abuse related liability may also be affected by the establishment or expansion of redress schemes, adding further uncertainty to long term fiscal impact and reinforcing the need for ongoing actuarial review and monitoring.

Basically, if the state finds itself in a position of having to take responsibility for wrongdoing which occurred on its watch, there is an economic and fiscal cost to our state down the track. Prevention, as we all know, is better than cure.

Fund our oversight entities so they can undertake their mandated statutory duties effectively and without fear or favour and they will assist in reducing the need for future redress schemes which will ultimately help the state's bottom line, and help avert trauma and harm to Tasmanians.

I already publicly called out the regressive step taken by this interim Budget, in the emission of a Gender Budget Impact Statement. I hope this mistake is an aberration, I really do. Ever since this Chamber voted in support of an earlier motion of mine on 8 March 2022, calling for an annual Gender Budget Impact Statement as part of the state budget papers, such a document has been included. However, I do need to note I was highly critical of the first attempt, but I have acknowledged in each subsequent year the improvements that have been made since were genuinely improving every single year. Yet here, we see an interim budget with no Gender Budget Impact Statement. Why is that? There's no explanation provided. I think it is a portent to potentially having this measure jettisoned in future budgets. There hasn't even been a commitment expressed - when this has been pointed out to the government - to make sure there will be one in next May's Budget.

Gender budget impact statements are recognised by other jurisdictions and economic institutions such as the OECD, as crucial economic and social policy tools. The tool recognises that every policy initiative in the budget has potential to impact men, women, non-binary and gender diverse people differently, even if the policy is designed to be gender neutral.

It further recognises these unintended consequences can mean a policy may result in inadvertently worsening the known gender gaps that other policy efforts are striving to close. For example: the failure to prioritise safe and accessible public transport, or housing, or education, or training impacts different genders differently. The failure to include a gender budget impact statement has been noted by other stakeholders. Shelter Tasmania's budget response on Friday 7 November included an observation about their disappointment that there was no gender budget impact statement. They pointed to the fact that:

It provides an important analysis as we seek to address the need for housing support for women facing homelessness.

This policy equity tool is not an optional extra. The gender budget impact statement should be hard-baked into the fiscal and budgetary process, and as stated by the Queensland Council of Social Service report on this matter:

Gender-responsive budgeting involves analysing all policy measures to identify the ways in which the policy can either advantage or potentially disadvantage different cohorts of the Queensland population on the basis of gender. These gender-based differences arise not necessarily by intent but because of different industries, different occupations and different roles in the household, organisations and wider community that men and women tend to take throughout their life path.

It's a really good little encapsulation from the Queensland Council of Social Service about why we look at gender-responsive budgeting and things like an analysis of a budget from a gender lens. A gender lens examination provided via that gender budget impact statement can help render the too-often-invisible ramifications of policy priorities visible so we can actively consider them and interrogate them. This non-discretionary, equity-focused tool is even more critical when we know the government's main attempt to balance the books looking ahead is to rely on cutting the public sector.

Of those earmarked 2800 jobs to go, what is the gender distribution going to be, I wonder. Has anyone in government asked the following policy impact questions and sought to answer them with evidence-based data, insights and analysis? For example, who's likely to benefit most from the policy? Who is at most risk of being disadvantaged or overlooked by a policy? How do particular cohorts of women stand to benefit from or potentially be disadvantaged by this policy, and ultimately, is the policy contributing towards closing gender gaps in the short, immediate or long term? It's not just the employment positions which should be scrutinised under a gender lens; it's also the impact those job cuts will have on service provision, on economic security, social inclusion and wellbeing, for example.

We have to assume in the absence of any indication otherwise, that no gender lens was used to scrutinise the policy deliverables of the interim Budget before us. I'm calling on the government to address this unacceptable omission as part of the formal response to the appropriation bills debate. Specifically, I'm urging the government to provide a reassurance that this omission was a mistaken oversight and to commit to continuing its automatic inclusion in future state budgets.

To conclude, the Treasurer claims interim budget is one that, 'avoids shock waves'. That may be true, but all that guarantees is future tsunamis. This government's wilful refusal to seriously engage in budget repair strategies now is a setup for dire, ideologically-driven cuts in the future - in fact, in the not too distant future with the May 2026-27 state Budget looming.

However, as I've noted during my contribution, there are steps this parliament can take to not only keep the pressure on for meaningful and equitable fiscal structural reform, but also to overhaul and modernise, where appropriate, our budgetary scrutiny and oversight mechanisms. I draw the Chamber's attention once more to o a statement made by the Treasurer on last Friday's ABC Mornings radio program:

And so with 'budget repair', and that's their language, I would say 'budget improvement', but whatever our language is, the time for political rhetoric is over. The time for action is now.

Exactly. I agree with the Treasurer. The time for action is now. When it comes to budget repair, and I do consider that language to be the factual description of the challenge before us, I couldn't agree more that the time for political rhetoric is over. The time for action is most definitely now, but the question remains: what action? Most pertinently, will this to-date fiscally-irresponsible Rockliff Liberal government have both the intestinal fortitude and the intellect to take the required action?

As I note the deeply concerning interim state Budget 2025-26, I also reiterate the need for this parliament to seize the opportunity presented by the next five-month window before the May Budget to consider how its scrutiny mechanisms can be strengthened and/or extended. The call to action applies to all of us. I note the Budget.

Noting - Budget Papers 2025-26 and Appropriation Bills (No. 1 and No. 2)

Continued from above.

[4.31 p.m.]
Ms LOVELL (Rumney) - Mr President, I rise to note the Budget handed down by the Treasurer, Mr Abetz, and make a brief contribution on the so-called interim Budget, which is a bit of a new term for our Parliament, and it's a term that nobody really seems particularly clear on its meaning. What it seems to me is an attempt to give cover for breaking election commitments, for failing to deliver promised funding, and for causing deep concern among those who rely on government funding to provide services that Tasmanians rely on.

I do want to acknowledge the contributions made by members over the last two days on this Budget, and I heard the member for Nelson make similar comments as I'd intended to. The contributions made in this place in particular have been really thoughtful and very thorough. I have to admit I've found it really difficult to figure out what to say about this Budget, so I really valued hearing those contributions and like the member for Nelson, it makes me enormously proud to be a member of this place.

I have found it really difficult. I found it difficult to know where to get started and then once I started, I found it difficult to know what to say because I really feel at a loss. When I spoke on the former treasurer's budget earlier this year, I didn't say much then either because I felt the same way. I remember saying that my contribution felt like it was all 'doom and gloom' and that I wasn't entirely comfortable with that, but that I felt like that's just where we were. Six months later, I don't feel like anything much is very different.

So, we have an interim Budget, and it just feels really like a bit of a holding pattern, a warning shot. Things were tough in the Budget that didn't pass the parliament. Things are tougher in this Budget and the only logical conclusion to draw is that things will be tougher again in May. But this didn't happen by accident. It hasn't happened to the government. This government has been in power for 11 years now. When they took over, there was money in the bank. They've managed the state's finances for 11 years. They are the ones who have made the decisions for 11 years. This Budget is entirely their making. 

This Budget is just as much about what's not included as it is about what's included. Election commitments that haven't been delivered. Broken promises. Tasmanians voted for the Liberal government based on what they were promised at the election and now they're left with empty words, with letters saying their commitments will be considered in the next Budget. TasInsure, the Premier's key election promise, where is it? He promised to save Tasmanians money on their insurance premiums. He promised to save small businesses money on their insurance premiums. Every day, day after day, for weeks, it was all he talked about. He wore the jacket every day, even on TV. There were hats, stubby holders, a fake office. Tasmanians voted for this. They voted for cheaper insurance. I have no doubt that was a key reason for many Tasmanians who are struggling with their insurance premiums and cost of living. It was a promise that was made to them. It was a promise they voted for. The Premier promised to introduce legislation for consultation within 100 days of being elected. It is the first thing in the 100-day plan:

Introduce legislation for consultation to establish TasInsure, our Tasmanian-owned and operated insurance company, ensuring Tasmanians pay less for insurance. This will enable TasInsure to be set up during 2026…

Well, where is it? How will it possibly be set up during 2026 with no funding behind it? No mention of it in the Budget. I don't believe it. It was a hoax, and it's cruel giving people false hope, making promises, then walking away. People put their faith in this government, in this Premier, and they are being let down. This government has always done it, but never quite so blatantly as this, and they can't even be honest about it.

Health funding is another example. We talk about this every year, and I know other members have made the same comments about the health funding in this interim budget. I was warning for weeks before the budget that this government needed to be honest for once, that the last thing we needed was another budget with dishonest funding commitments for health, like we get every year - an allocated amount that we all know is well under what is actually required.

This year, we had the fortuitous timing of the annual report at the same time as we are considering the Budget. We can see, in black and white, the amount to the dollar that was spent by the health department last year. We can see, in black and white, the amount budgeted for that same spending in this year ahead. It is less - millions of dollars less. Tens of millions of dollars, actually. Yet, the health minister and other ministers have had the gall to try and say that's not true, that there's no cut to the health budget, that more was being budgeted this year than last year.

Sure, that bit is true: if you compare budget-to-budget, the figures this year are higher. However, we all knew that what was budgeted last year wasn't going to be enough - because it never is - and sure enough, we had supplementary appropriation bills through the year. The department overspent the budget, as we knew they would. And so, while it's true to say more has been budgeted this year than was budgeted last year, that's not the problem. That's not what we're talking about and they know it. They must know it. It would be so refreshing if they could just be honest about it, but this budget is not honest. It just isn't.

Other members have spoken about the public sector wage negotiations - negotiations we've seen deteriorate into a take-it-or-leave-it bad-faith ultimatum. The ultimatum does nothing to address the many issues with workload and workplace safety that workers have been talking about for years. Now, with the Budget in front of us, we know that the 3 per cent bad-faith ultimatum hasn't even been budgeted for. Two-and-a-half per cent for public sector wage growth - they haven't even budgeted for the wage increase they are demanding their workers accept. It's just dishonest.

Where does that leave us? It leaves us with a public sector workforce that is sick and tired of being taken for granted and villainised by their own employer. It leaves us with public services that are still underfunded, under-supported, and under significant stress. It leaves us with a community services sector that is shedding staff as we speak in this place because of lack of funding security they were promised years ago. It leaves us with a Budget that's a dishonest mess with no path out.

I said in May I felt like my speech was full of doom and gloom, and just like the budget, nothing much has changed. Try as they might, there is nobody the government can blame but themselves.

I note the Budget.

[4.39 p.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - Mr President, I rise to represent the people of our great capital city, Nipaluna/Hobart, very few of whom will have had the will or opportunity to read the 2025-26 Tasmanian Budget. Lucky them, to have been spared the pain it forebodes for now. They'll feel its effect soon enough. Come next May, the cuts will be deeper, as we know.

As a number of members have mentioned, Treasury's Pre-Election Financial Outlook was frank and unequivocal: 'Immediate and sustained action is needed.' (tbc 4.40) Sadly, we're not seeing much evidence of a commitment to that in this interim budget. Next May is when the real bite will come. It remains to be seen whether the Treasurer, Mr Abetz, and the Premier have the kind of courage demonstrated by former Labor premiers, Michael Field and Lara Giddings during minority governments, as the member for Huon reminded us in his excellent engaging speech yesterday. It takes great courage to do unpopular things because they're the right thing to do, and those two premiers in minority governments with the Greens and supported by the Greens had the courage to take the budget challenge and deal with it. I remind members that when the Labor-Greens government ended in 2014, net debt stood at $226 million, a small sum relative to what we're dealing with today.

While I can't know the exact mind of Hobart residents on matters of fiscal strategy, having door knocked at two state elections, a Legislative Council election and a federal election in the last two years, as well as many conversations in the community along the way, I can confirm there is a deep level of worry in the community about the shape of the state's finances. People in Hobart and across the island understand we are in a very serious financial mess. It's stressing people out. They're worried about what such burgeoning debt and government profligacy will mean for the future and that of the kids they love. They see service cuts, job losses, and higher state taxes on the horizon.

I am sure, some of us in here can really empathise with being stressed out about the state of the finances, but unlike our constituents who are stuck with the consequences of government mismanagement and drunken sailor spending, soaring debt service cuts, job losses and likely higher state taxes in future, in here we can do something about it, and I will get to the big white elephant in the room shortly.

What a woeful set of numbers and government priorities are before us. The numbers have been laid out with such precision yesterday and today by all my independent colleagues in this place. I want to echo the statement of the member for Nelson, each contribution by an independent member in this place has been informed, precise, deeply thoughtful and an education. It confirms with me that every day is indeed a school day and yet with this interim budget, we have a powerful sense of deja vu. This interim budget is not so different in any substantive way to what we were presented with a few short months ago before Labor sent us to another costly election. Of course, as the budget papers make clear an election that wasn't quite as costly in terms of its contribution to state debt as the 2018 and 2021 state elections which added around $1.4 billion to net debt as it stands today.

In some ways this Budget is an act of subterfuge. As a number of members have pointed out, the Treasurer, Mr Abetz, had plenty of time and Treasury resources to direct and to prepare a more honest budget.

The Treasurer says this budget provides us with a glide path to surplus, but it seems more likely that it's designed to provide a glide path for government to get past the stadium vote. It's hard not to be cynical, but it does feel like this interim Budget aims to provide some small, very small false sense of security. That the government has things in hand, knows what it's doing, that the pain won't be too bad, and that, of course, we can afford and build a brand-new stadium at Macquarie Point, so go ahead, support the stadium order. Everything will be fine. Just give us the stadium and all the state's economic troubles will begin to vanish overnight. Jobs and growth, high-vis vests, that'll fix it.

Of course, we know that's a lie, given budgets are a black-and-white expression of political choices, and given the current state of ours, if the stadium is approved and built, it will necessarily drive austerity budgets for a generation or more. The Tasmanian Planning Commission was very clear about that in its final integrated assessment report. We shouldn't trust this Budget. It's not honest. It lacks a coherent plan. It's full of holes through the out years across portfolios.

Intensive Family Engagement Services: $4 million for two years, then cut. Out-of-home care increase: a critical $15 million over two years, then cut. Foster and kinship carer uplift: funded for one year, then cut. Transition to independence for children in out-of-home care: $3 million for two years, then cut. It treats us like fools. It's not as if though the needs in those areas of public policy will have abated to any significant extent. The government will have to deal with funding pressures in those areas of critical public policy in the out years of this Budget. It is nothing more than accounting trickery. Services that will actually improve the futures of Tasmanian children will be wound back before we even begin to see their positive effect; or government will decide and recognise that funding is needed. 

As part of his verbal armoury of political blackmail tropes like 'No Stadium, No Team', the Premier constantly claims the Macquarie Point stadium is all about giving young people hope for the future. How about the Tasmanian children and young people who need that extra support now and over the forward estimates? How about prioritising homes for them? As Adrienne Piccone of TasCOSS reminded attendees at the post-Budget forum, with the amount of money that the government wants to invest in a new stadium at Macquarie Point, it could provide a home for every one of the more than 5000 applicants who are on the housing waitlist. That waitlist obscenely grows and grows.

I know we have a relatively new Minister for Housing and Planning in this portfolio, but, minister Vincent, you have inherited a portfolio which for 11 years was underfunded, neglected, dismissed. There wasn't even any new money going into housing for the first term of the Hodgman government until the last year before that state election in 2018. It's shameful. As the honourable member for Nelson pointed out, there's also no action on rents, on short-stay accommodation, or on basic minimum standards for residential tenants. It is an area of public policy that this government for 11 years has disregarded and has not thought through the social consequences of not providing homes for people. The government has forgotten that housing itself, if you want to talk about job generation, is significant social infrastructure.

How about young Tasmanians who want to see government take accelerating global heating seriously and set priorities and allocate resources towards emissions reduction and adaptation planning? Young Tasmanians are staring down the barrel of climate catastrophe. The Greens have been accused in the other place, when we do ask about climate, of Armageddon-style politics, of catastrophising. The scientists are telling us we are staring down the barrel of climate catastrophe. It is possible that within 25 years civilization will be on its knees across the globe. 

Yet, in this Budget, it's like climate change has been fixed. There's nothing in here for young people who are looking to the government for leadership on climate, but cuts of more than $7 million a year to the climate office; a delayed climate action plan [Bookmark: Phr2_O=7.8_D=11.8_C=0.82] , underfunded fire services across agencies - whether it's the TFS, the SES, Parks or Forestry firefighters - we are seeing [Bookmark: Phr3_O=20.1_D=11.3_C=0.87]  a clear indication of government not taking the threat seriously enough, and that means deprioritising community safety [Bookmark: Phr4_O=32.4_D=6.8_C=0.91] , and playing pretty carelessly and recklessly with our small island economy in the future.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=39.8_D=12.1_C=0.89] In the budget papers across the forward Estimates, money is drained out of the natural disaster relief fund [Bookmark: Phr6_O=53.1_D=29.6_C=0.83] , as if those out years of the Budget - and wouldn't it be great if we could be sure they were - will be years where accelerating climate impacts don't hit this island and small communities like Dunalley, for example, in 2013. At a time when national and state climate risk assessments are almost shrill, desperately so, in their calls for urgent actions and investment from [Bookmark: Phr7_O=82.9_D=24.2_C=0.79]  governments, we have a government in this Budget that utterly deprioritises climate action, all the while, of course, continuing to log and burn our beautiful, carbon-banking native forests. 

It is utterly dispiriting. It's also alarming, in the context of fire risk to the most [Bookmark: Phr8_O=107.9_D=5.4_C=0.74]  catastrophic bushfire-prone capital city in the country, our capital of Nipaluna-Hobart [Bookmark: Phr9_O=113.7_D=30.0_C=0.85] , there's still no evacuation plan for Hobart, but we're being offered a stadium which will take more money away from necessary climate adaptation and mitigation measures. The pettiness and inexplicable priorities manifest in this Budget are glaring. We can have a stadium which by the time it's built will definitely cost at least $2 billion, but half-price bus fares to assist Tasmanians [Bookmark: Phr10_O=143.8_D=3.0_C=0.86]  struggling with the rising cost of living: discontinued. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=147.7_D=12.8_C=0.77]  The Libraries Tasmania 26Ten community program to help adults improve their literacy and numeracy: written off. Shame on this government for that. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=161.3_D=3.7_C=0.79]  Extra support for family violence intervention programs: gone.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=166.8_D=19.9_C=0.84] There are other services that are experiencing increased demand which the Budget doesn't accommodate for: Shekinah House[checked] homelessness assistance; pain and rheumatology services for outpatients; and Legal Aid, savagely underfunded, just to name a few [Bookmark: Phr14_O=187.6_D=7.1_C=0.88] , and the little bit of extra money that they do have in the Budget, in six months' time this extra funding will be taken away. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=195.3_D=15.3_C=0.85]  That pathetic little projected surplus the Treasurer made sure was cooked up to suggest we're on that right glide path, all it will take is for a few of those glaring gaps in the out years to be filled [Bookmark: Phr16_O=211.7_D=29.7_C=0.85] , or one or three severe climate-related weather events, for example, and poof, that tiny surplus is gone. No-one in this place should be fooled by it. 

In this place we have the power to help deliver not only transparency and accountability for this interim Budget; we have the power and the responsibility to improve the bottom line by rejecting the Macquarie Point stadium. If you go to the risks section of Budget Paper 1 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=245.3_D=6.0_C=0.75] , page 81, the pretty poorly named Macquarie Point Stadium Urban Renewal Project [Bookmark: Phr19_O=253.4_D=28.4_C=0.82]  is identified as a specific expenditure risk and sensitivity. The budget paper says:[tbc]

The 2025-26 Budget and forward Estimates includes funding of $609 million to deliver a new multipurpose stadium, arts, entertainment and sporting precinct as part of the Macquarie Point Urban Renewal Project. This project includes the Macquarie Point multipurpose stadium. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=282.1_D=15.7_C=0.84]  This funding includes: $354 million of the state's total commitment of $375 million, the Australian Government's total commitment of $240 million and the $15 million commitment from the AFL, expected to be received in 2027-28.

 [Bookmark: Phr21_O=298.6_D=6.4_C=0.86] As we know, the government has since provided a revised cost estimate for the Macquarie Point stadium of $1.13 billion. The updated figure reflects enhancements to the stadium's design and functionality, together with an escalation in costs since the original project estimate was developed. This figure also includes $4.5 million to support infrastructure works associated with the redevelopment of the Federation Concert Hall, which will be provided as a grant to the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra through the Department of State Growth.

I want to pause to express my empathy for the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, which continues to have very legitimate and deep concerns about the impact of construction noise and the operation of the stadium on one of the world's smallest - if not the smallest - fine orchestras. Yet, this government has sought to buy off the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra with a $4.5 million upgrade. When we get into Estimates, we will be asking ministers whether any threats were made to the TSO about its funding based on its expressed public concern about the impact of the stadium on its operation. It will be good to have ministers asked that at the Table and have to, theoretically, provide an honest answer.

The 'risks and sensitivity' statement on the Macquarie Point stadium dismisses the Tasmanian Planning Commission's concerns and final recommendation and talks up these elusive and vague far wider benefits associated with the project that aren't part of the TPCs assessment. It's pretty clear the Macquarie Point Development Corporation will use borrowings to fund the difference between the total equity contributions and the final cost to deliver the Macquarie Point multipurpose stadium.

Let's not be deluded about this; the Macquarie Point Development Corporation is the government. The money that's borrowed by MPDC is being borrowed by the state of Tasmania and it would be paid back by the people of Tasmania. There's a whole lot of risks that are identified in the budget papers, but we should in here know that one of the primary risks to the state's finances now and in the future is that Macquarie Point stadium.

We've also seen really clear evidence of poor priorities in relation to Homes Tasmania. In the Homes Tasmania section of the Budget, it says no specific equity contributions have been allocated to Homes Tasmania in this Budget, but what we see is a housing state-owned company that by the end of the out years in this budget will have $1.1 billion in debt strapped to its back. Its interest costs will double over the next two years. Some of us in here remember a time when Commonwealth and state governments invested equity themselves in the construction of new social housing. That's how we had and have a social housing stock on this island of more than 13,000 homes. That was paid for by taxpayers, by governments. Now we've got this neo-conservative model which hobbles Homes Tasmania, saddles it with debt, which the government can push off the books a bit because it's not general government sector debt, but it is debt that will hobble Homes Tasmania.

I remember how much we celebrated and, as Housing minister, how hard we fought to have the Commonwealth state housing debt forgiven, and it was forgiven, when, by my recall, the Commonwealth state housing debt was less than $400 million. And here we are, and I do look forward to the Minister for Housing and Planning coming back to the Council, as he promised he would yesterday in Question Time, with some details about exactly how many new social homes particularly, but new social and affordable homes, Homes Tasmania has built.

So there is  no equity contribution to Homes Tasmania, but laced through this Budget is money going into Macquarie Point Development Corporation and Stadiums Tasmania. That tells us everything we need to know about this government's priorities. There is $609 million in this interim Budget for the stadium and if we vote against the stadium, there's $609 million that's not being strapped onto our debt burden. There's $50 million, $30 million, $50 million, $60 million or $70 million, depending on who you listen to, whether it's Treasury you're listening to or the Coordinator-General, in interest costs for the stadium each year, which the state won't have to beg or borrow to meet interest payments on stadium borrowings. There's $2 billion that won't be added to the state's heavy and growing debt burden within a decade.

The alternative is stadium austerity for generations to pay for a piece of infrastructure that is wildly unpopular in the community and I'm absolutely certain that all members in this place are noting the volume, the quality and the passion of the correspondence that we are receiving from people who are strongly opposed to this stadium and urging us in very heartfelt ways, to vote against the order.

There's a whole lot of extra cost to the stadium which we need to explore as well. We have additional site works for $32 million, the northern access road and event plaza, around $76 million in extra costs. The carpark into the acid sulphate sludge of the harbour there near Macquarie Point, which went from a three-storey carpark to a two-storey carpark, is now costed at about $97 million. The event buses that will be required to get people to and from, again costed in today's dollars at about $49 million. Compensation and upgrades for the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, as we've already discussed, $4.5 million dollars. Davey, Collins and Hunter street path widenings, $17.6 million. All of these costs ultimately will be borne by the people of Tasmania, just as any cost overrun on the Macquarie Point stadium will be borne by us as well.

I cannot let the opportunity go past without - well, I'll just be frank about it - telling some truths about the Labor opposition on this Budget. Having sent us off to a state election in July this year on the basis of a Budget that looked almost exactly the same, we have a highly conflicted Labor opposition and we had the statement in here from the member for Pembroke yesterday where he said in his contribution:[tbc]

This is just the interim Budget that sets the scene for the cuts that will come. Next year's Budget will be the Budget where Tasmanians really feel the pain and there'll be no more excuse-making of letters that can refer us forward to next May. Ultimately it's Tasmanians who are going to pay the price for these past 11 years and if you can't manage the budget properly, you can't deliver the services Tasmanians rely on. (TBC)

He said:

We now have a treasurer who called massive debt 'intergenerational theft'. 

Well, I believe he's been caught red handed. What we have here, and I listened carefully to the honourable member for Rumney's contribution as well, and I'm not surprised that she found it difficult to know what to say. We have an opposition here which is complicit in this Budget mess, and the core complicity right now is the fact that the Labor opposition has given its unconditional support to the Macquarie Point stadium and so we have honourable members of the Labor Party and shadow treasurers make statements about the need for fiscal restraint but at the same time giving unconditional support to the Macquarie Point stadium. It is shameful. The opposition doesn't have a crooked leg to stand on regarding the subject of fiscal responsibility.

It's always true to say that budgets are about political choices: we see that with the choice not to properly fund Homes Tasmania; the choices to cut essential community support in the out years; the choice to allocate more than $600 million into the stadium alone in these four years in the Budget, which interestingly is not that far off the shortfall that the Budget identifies in the Health sector of about $673 million over the next five years.

Mr President, did you know in our hospitals for example, where our hardworking healthcare workers are doing double shifts, instead of prioritising investment into the health of Tasmanians through preventative health, instead of really working with people who work in our public health system on ways where there could be efficiencies, this government is taking the Milo out of kitchens at the hospital. You have doctors, nurses, therapists and pharmacists who are working long hours and days - sometimes doing double shifts - who are now being told by their employer that they can't drink Milo, even though very few of them in that situation are actually able to take a lunch break. It is stupid and it's petty. It sends a message to the people who work everyday to keep Tasmanians alive and well that this government isn't interested in their workplace wellbeing.

The State of the Environment Report, after two statutory deadlines passed without the government delivering a State of the Environment Report, made a suite of recommendations designed to strengthen environmental resilience, protect biodiversity and to protect all those ecosystem services the environment provides us. Again, another report calling for urgent action and investment; with no funding, not one cent allocated towards implementing any of the recommendations in the State of the Environment Report. Throughout the Budget you see cuts across the forward Estimates to environmental services and cuts to the threatened species unit. Again, it's a word that is used too often in here, but it is shameful. From a treasurer, who in his opening line of his budget speech talked about, which I was quite struck to hear him say these words, but of course we know the lens through which he says them, it's one of exploitation said: (tbc 5.08)

Tasmania's resources of people and nature's bounty ensures no challenges to great and no challenge can erode the positive future that is ours.

Well, nature's bounty won't be there to sustain us, or our children and grandchildren if we don't start investing in it. Perhaps the Treasurer, as he develops the May Budget, could come to terms with the fact that if you invest in environmental repair and protection and you involve communities in that and scientists you're investing in our future.

The education section of the Budget also dispiriting and something that I very much look forward to having an ongoing conversation with the minister about. There's uncertainty in this Budget and expressed in the notes about the fairer funding allocation and the state's contribution. At this point in the budget cycle, the department and the minister can't take an educated guess in the budget about how much in state funds under the Better and Fairer Schools Funding Agreement will be rolled out.

There are also cuts in the Budget for children, families and services for Youth Justice and those little dotted lines and gaps in the out years, as the member for Nelson highlighted in her contribution, the Integrity Commission.

Where we've had successive chief commissioners speak publicly in public hearings to the media and to the Integrity Committee about the pressing need for extra funding to enable the Integrity Commission to do its vital work - improving standards of ethics and governance in the public service and among public officers - what do we get? Starvation funding for the Integrity Commission. It feels deliberate, and same too for the National Preventive Mechanism, which has had some scraps offered to it but nothing substantive to enable it to undertake its statutory function to prevent cruel treatment in places of detention in Tasmania.

We're also seeing cuts to our European Heritage and Heritage Tasmania.

There are cuts to the justice portfolio across the forward estimates. We know from people who wait four and five years for their day in court in the Supreme or Magistrates Court, that our court system is under enormous strain. It is very clear more resourcing is needed to invest into the Supreme Court and the Magistrates Court. But no extra money for justice in this budget. There's also a line item in the budget which cuts funding to Victim Support Services. Another one of those dotted lines in the out year's scenario.

In the other place today, our leader, Dr Rosalie Woodruff, presented to the parliament and had tabled what we would do differently. Now under a a normal scenario, as we have for many, many years, the Greens would present an alternative budget. We took a suite of fully costed policies to the last state election which showed that if you prioritise the wellbeing of your people and if you look after the environment, it's good for the economy, especially a little island and connected economy like ours.

We had all our policies; bar a very small handful at the end that Treasury didn't have time to cost. We submitted them for costings and our costings were pretty bang on. We have presented and we continue to present an alternative to this neo-liberal, high-vis vest unempathetic approach to government spending.

I will hand around a copy of our Tasmanian Greens budget repair plan. But we've had a look at reckless spending and there are things that clearly can be done here to generate revenue. We could, for example, de-fund that loss-making, destructive government business, Forestry Tasmania, saving a total of $48 million over 4 years.

We could reduce the money in the Treasurer's Reserve, which is splashed around fairly carelessly as we've seen following, particularly, the 2018 state election. We could de-fund Tasracing and save $154 million over the forwards.

We could do what the Victorian government has done in and around Melbourne and introduce a 1 per cent vacant property levy. We could increase the tax rate for electronic gaming machines by 45 per cent, bringing it into line with similar jurisdictions rather than the small casino in Townsville, which the tax rate here was pegged at, and raise an extra $173 million.

We could increase mineral royalties, so they were just at the national average. I note in the budget papers it is projected the state of Tasmania will earn less from mineral royalties over the forward estimates because of the vagaries of the commodities market.

Well, what we should do, Mr President, is raise mineral royalties just to the national average. It's not like these mining companies are going to go anywhere else if they have identified a prospective resource here.

Salmon royalties, again, we give away free real estate for the big salmon companies to pollute. Increase salmon royalties and you can raise close to $440 million over the forward years. Defund the stadium and over the forward Estimates save $360 million. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=26.6_D=4.6_C=0.86]  Abolish the land tax reduction: $30 million saved. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=33.4_D=23.5_C=0.80]  The ridiculous expenditure on new, damaging tracks in the Arthur Pieman: saving $7 million. We could make some cuts to the Office of the Coordinator-General. 

Mr Duigan - No new tracks in the Arthur-Pieman. 

Ms O'CONNOR - What about that iconic walk that you want to spend millions of dollars of taxpayers' money on, when we already have so many iconic walks, while you're not properly funding Legal Aid and children's services, minister? [Bookmark: Phr4_O=57.9_D=5.0_C=0.75]  We could divest from the current Marinus equity share, saving $27 million [Bookmark: Phr5_O=63.2_D=7.6_C=0.66] , scrap the planned Marinus equity top-up, saving nearly $100 million.
 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=72.8_D=0.6_C=0.90] 
 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=77.5_D=1.1_C=0.90] This Budget [Bookmark: Phr8_O=79.8_D=16.9_C=0.85]  is one of the more depressing and cynical budgets that I've seen in my many years in state parliament. It's a wolf in sheep's clothing. It is designed to give us a slightly false sense of security about the state of the finances. But no, there are no fools in here [Bookmark: Phr9_O=97.6_D=21.0_C=0.89] , and I'm sure that next week at Estimates, just as independent members of this place have done this week, the Legislative Council will do the work examining this cynical interim Budget. 

In some ways it's good timing [Bookmark: Phr10_O=119.3_D=2.2_C=0.92] , because not long after we get back from [Bookmark: Phr11_O=123.2_D=9.5_C=0.83]  scrutinising this cynical interim Budget that prioritises a roofed stadium over homes and roofs over the heads of Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr12_O=133.5_D=19.4_C=0.84] ns, we will have that critical vote, which will have such a profound influence, whichever way it goes, on the state's fiscal fortunes, not just for the next four years, but for the life of that stadium, whether it be 30 years or 50 years. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=154.6_D=5.4_C=0.80]  That's a debate we will get to in early December.

I am not [Bookmark: Phr14_O=162.3_D=29.4_C=0.85]  necessarily optimistic by nature, but I'm heartened in some ways by the depths of the contributions that have been made by my colleagues in this place on the Budget. There were some magnificent contributions and, here's hoping that when the moment comes, just as we hope that the Treasurer and this government will have the courage to do the right thing in developing [Bookmark: Phr15_O=192.2_D=2.9_C=0.65]  the Budget for May, here's hoping [Bookmark: Phr16_O=196.1_D=14.4_C=0.87]  that we do the right thing in here on the stadium order, because you cannot look at this interim Budget without considering the choice that will come before us in early December. I note the Budget.

[5.18 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) -  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=211.5_D=5.3_C=0.70]  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=228.3_D=25.8_C=0.83] Mr President, I want to add to the honourable member for Hobart and a number of other members who have acknowledged the contributions that have been made in the House over the past two days relating to the Budget. Each and every one was a considered contribution, and I appreciated [Bookmark: Phr20_O=254.8_D=2.5_C=0.90]  the work that had gone into those. I know that [Bookmark: Phr21_O=257.7_D=3.4_C=0.68]  there were people listening elsewhere that have taken [Bookmark: Phr22_O=263.0_D=25.4_C=0.80]  note of those.

I have some responses to some of the matters that were raised. In regard to the member for McIntyre, what are the costs associated with establishing the Efficiency and Productivity Unit? The answer is $1.5 million per annum for two years. It is provided in the 2025-26 [Bookmark: Phr23_O=288.9_D=0.7_C=0.58]  Budget [Bookmark: Phr24_O=291.5_D=13.3_C=0.84] , a significant amount of money, and we hope it makes a real positive impact. To the member for Pembroke, the impact of the COI on the Budget: the 2024-25 Budget allocated funding of $425 million over the Budget and forward Estimates in relation to the COI recommendations.

The member for Elwick asked how the government proposes to raise revenue or make cuts to fund the stadium asset: I know this will be of interest to all members. Equity funding is provided in the 2025-26 Budget of $609 million from the stadium, including $240 million in Australian Government funding and the $15 million AFL contribution, and following the utilisation of equity funding, the Macquarie Point Development Corporation will borrow funds from TASCORP to deliver the project, and I know the member for Hobart spoke about that in her contribution.
 

Again, the member for Elwick, the funding for the Hobart Phoenix Basketball facility, which was an election commitment in the Budget, the funding priorities, including commitments made at the last election, will be considered as part of the 2026-27 Budget development process in conjunction with an assessment of the delivery of existing programs and services, and this will include commitments made to support the Home of Football initiative for Football Tasmania of $350,000 and the commitment to the New Town Bay project for Phoenix Basketball.

The member for Mersey, stadium costs, stadium construction implications on the housing construction workforce, and obviously there are significant opportunities presented by a $30 billion infrastructure pipeline including the stadium proposal, and the High Vis Army program is supporting the next generation of tradies, and is designed to build and train the next generation of workers needed to deliver this critical infrastructure and housing.

The response also includes a number of areas that have already started the program. The Civil Contractors Federation ran 29 job-ready and awareness programs, four women in civil programs and two programs specifically for migrants. The Master Builders Association completed the construction of its new training facility at Cambridge, which has already had over 280 students train in it in partnership with TasTAFE. 

The National Electrical Contractors Association is leading the way in renewable energy training, delivering solar and leadership training to over 55 students, and to date the High Vis Army members have presented on 650 occasions at school, industry and job seeker events, with over 62,000 people exposed to careers in construction. There's a second wave of High Vis as it looks to this training and expanding the state's capacity to build the homes that are needed. There are also several established group training organisation (GTOs), and they can manage apprentice and training recruitment for the stadium project and subcontractors, so a significant piece of work in that area going on.

Again for the member for Mersey, the funding for the Voluntary Assisted Dying portal, and there's no member in this House who doesn't acknowledge the work that the honourable member for Mersey has put in and continues to commit to in relation to VAD. The Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing can assure the member for Mersey that the government is committed to implementing a VAD portal as soon as practicable to assist practitioners who participate in the VAD process. The minister is taking advice on the best way to ensure this occurs in a suitable format for all key stakeholders. 

The Department of Health has advised that significant work has progressed in exploring a potential provider with capacity to develop a VAD data management system, including the costs associated with the implementation and where this is allocated within the broader Department of Health budget. Recognising the process to review the Voluntary Assisted Dying Act has commenced, it is noted that potential outcomes or recommendations for the review may impact a future VAD data management system, and these would also need to be considered. In the interim, work to refine documentation, to remove duplication and to enable increased electronic completion continues, looking at the current process. That's the member for Mersey and we thank him for his ongoing commitment.

The member for Montgomery asked what factors the government expects to change that will bring interstate migration back to nearly zero?' In the long term, Tasmania's net interstate migration is around zero, while the past couple of years it has been negative and it's been slowly moving back towards zero, this is expected to continue, underpinned by the expectation of improved relative affordability in Tasmanian housing compared to the rest of Australia, as well as a strong labour market. In the final two years of the forward Estimates, projections are presented in the Budget. The use of projections is relatively common across Australian jurisdictions, reflecting the level of uncertainty involved in forecasting a few years into the future, and projections differ from forecast in that they are generally based on the long-term average growth rate of the economic indicators. Seeing as you're a numbers guy, I think you will get all that.

The member for Montgomery also asked where is the growth in the forward Estimates coming from? Over the forward Estimates, it's expected that there will be growth at cost-of-living challenges. As cost-of-living challenges are forecast to continue to ease and Tasmanian households and businesses become more confident as a result, this is expected to lead to growth in household consumption and private investment in 2026-27. The Government expenditure is also expected to continue to grow along with international exports, which reflects the assumption that a lot of current international trade policy disruptions will be settled, although not completely gone by 2026-27.

The member for Montgomery asked about Dial Park change room facilities. It's the Government's understanding that the council is mindful of balancing the needs of stakeholders against their ongoing responsibilities as the owner of Dial Park and as such developments such as new amenities for Oval B have not been considered a priority for the council. Instead, the Government is advised the council will work with existing users, such as the Penguin football and cricket clubs - you probably know those well - to maximise the shared use of existing facilities, which it should be remembered, are significant. The Government is advised that the council has concerns about their asset portfolio and is looking to explore alternative options. These decisions are being made with the best interest of the local community in mind and the future of the facility. A bit of local work to do there, but certainly on the radar.

The member for Huon, and I don't know that I will have too many analogies in your responses, but I certainly enjoyed your contribution. In regard to the growth in the size of the public service, the Government continues to focus on strategic workforce priorities to better respond to the increasing demands for service in the Tasmanian community, while supporting the workforce. This involves ensuring that the Government maintains a workforce that is sustainable in size and shape, located where it is needed and equipped with the right tools and resources to deliver essential services to the Tasmanian community. The Tasmanian service has experienced growth in the workforce following an increase in staffing levels in recent years, particularly during the COVID pandemic, as it continues to be agile and responsive to the needs of the Tasmanian community. I'm not going to be telling anyone anything that they don't know here in saying that the Commission of Inquiry to the Tasmanian Government's Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings has resulted in new roles being created across agencies that have a direct input into the ongoing protection of children, and nobody's going to walk away from that.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=26.7_D=6.0_C=0.56] The growth in the workforce is largely driven by the government's commitment to boosting essentially services [Bookmark: Phr3_O=33.1_D=25.5_C=0.78]  around the state and the government must ensure Tasmania has a workforce that is the right size and shape, in the right place and equipped with the right tools and resources to deliver to the Tasmanian community. And that's a repeat. The fiscal strategy employee targets in 2032 are to return employee numbers to  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.5_D=0.2_C=0.96] pre-COVID levels [Bookmark: Phr5_O=61.3_D=1.5_C=0.92]  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=64.4_D=22.8_C=0.86] , and it goes on to talk a lot about the investment in frontline services and given the time, and I know that the member will already have that information and I'm happy to share those directly with the member when we conclude this debate.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=88.7_D=16.1_C=0.81] The member for Murchison and the member for Nelson also asked about the body-worn cameras. Tasmania Police has a seven-year contract with Axon to supply and support of body worn cameras (BWCs) [Bookmark: Phr8_O=105.0_D=22.6_C=0.85]  and the Budget provides an additional $800,000 over two years on top of recurrent funding for BWCs. This additional funding will allow for the purchase and support of BWCs to growth positions and specialist units for the life of the contract.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=128.6_D=28.8_C=0.81] In regard to the member for Murchison's extensive questions around Project Marinus, and I feel sure that the member would appreciate having these questions and answers, there are four pages of them, and I'm interested to know whether the honourable member would be happy if I tabled those or would you like me to read them?

Ms Forrest - Table them but have them incorporated into Hansard so they are part of the record and send me a copy.

Ms RATTRAY - [Bookmark: Phr10_O=157.8_D=15.6_C=0.78]  Absolutely, I have got the exact words. 

I seek leave to table a document and have it incorporated into the Hansard record. 

Leave granted; document tabled.

See Appendix 1 (page xxx).

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=173.6_D=7.1_C=0.70]  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=193.5_D=6.7_C=0.87] Ms RATTRAY - I will get a copy to the member as soon as possible [Bookmark: Phr13_O=203.6_D=2.0_C=0.76] , and I thank the member for that.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=206.7_D=14.8_C=0.83] The member for Nelson asked about climate change forward Estimates. Future funding for climate change is something the Government will consider moving forward. This is an interim Budget and there's a large body of work still being executed related to [Bookmark: Phr15_O=221.7_D=4.2_C=0.55]  the well-funded Climate Change Action Plan.

Members interjecting.

Ms RATTRAY -  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=230.6_D=21.8_C=0.82] I can hear a couple of voices from that way, but I will finish what I have. It might not be sufficient, and I will do my best to further expand on that if the members are of a mind to request that. There's $10 million from the 2021-22 Budget and an additional $3 million [Bookmark: Phr17_O=252.8_D=15.2_C=0.85]  for the Low Emissions Livestock Grant program through the 2023-24 and the revised Estimates report $2.4 million and the 2024-25 budget of $600,000, [Bookmark: Phr18_O=268.2_D=22.0_C=0.84]  and $1.3 million from the Emissions Reduction Loan Scheme from the 2020-21 Budget has been reprofiled to support the implementation of the emissions reduction and resilience plans. There are 98 actions in the action plan in total across government equating to an investment o [Bookmark: Phr19_O=291.5_D=8.0_C=0.90] f $250 million.

That's some information. If it's not enough, please reach out.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=301.6_D=3.4_C=0.85] To the member for Nelson in regard to the Gender Budget Impact Statement, the annual Gender Budget Statement is a key action in the Equal Means Equal - Tasmanian Women's Strategy 2022- 2027, and the statement has broad sector support. There was a Gender Budget Statement in the May 2025 Budget, and there will be a Gender Budget Statement in the May 2026 Budget.

That's what I have now. Should there be outstanding responses to questions, I will certainly make sure that they are tabled at the next sitting. I've done my best to provide as many answers as I possibly can, and again, I thank and acknowledge the contributions from members.

Mr President, I move -

That the Budget papers and the Appropriation Bills No. 1 and No. 2 of 2025 be referred to Estimates Committees A and B of this Council.

Motion agreed to.


DANGEROUS CRIMINALS AND HIGH RISK OFFENDERS AMENDMENT BILL 2025 (No. 46)

In Committee

Continued from 6 November 2025 (page xx).

Clause 5 - 
Section 35 amended (HRO orders)

Madam CHAIR - Just while the Leader is getting herself settled there, I will remind members that the only person who's spoken on clause 5 is the member for Nelson, who's used three calls, and the Leader was on her feet, responding. Oh, my apologies. I believe you were on your feet. I thought you'd sat down. My memory's not as good. Just one second, I'm just getting more advice.

Obviously, you may need to repeat your question. It might have been helpful to have a look at the Hansard.

Ms RATTRAY - Madam Chair, I do have a response to the member's question. I recall we were working diligently to try to put something together, so that might have been why the member was still on her feet.

Madam CHAIR - If the Leader could get to her feet, perhaps? I remember the member for Nelson was on her feet. Sorry, maybe sit back down - but, member for Nelson, get on your feet. If the Leader could just indicate what the question was about that the member for Nelson was seeking a response to, in case she has a little more.

Ms WEBB - Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate that indulgence just to prompt me promptly.

Ms RATTRAY - There was the reporting matter that you asked about and the engagement with the Tasmanian Aboriginal leadership.

Ms WEBB - Yes. That is the part that I was wondering about, that we were waiting to get some more information, I believe - the interaction with the Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service, and then how these things would be reported as having been issued to people.

Madam CHAIR - I recall that's exactly what you were asking about in the third call, because it wasn't addressed in your first call.

Ms WEBB - I don't believe I had further questions, Madam Chair. I was leaving it at that. I'll sit down now. It's my third call, I know. I hope the answers are good.

CHAIR - Thank you. Honourable Leader.

Ms RATTRAY - Thank you very much, and I appreciate the House allowing us to have enough time to provide a fulsome answer to the member.

In regard to the reporting, the member for Nelson asked whether the grant of an application to extend the period of an offender's custody for up to the seven days would be reported on, such as in annual reports, including the reasons for the delay. The member also asked whether there was annual reporting of the HRO orders. The response I provided at the time was that the data would be available, but it wouldn't be reported at that level of detail.

As the member appeared to take this to mean that there were no annual reports, would provide data about how many HRO order applications had been made or completed. I'd like to provide clarification that the annual report for the Department of Justice does include some data relating to HRO orders. However, as I indicated previously, it is at a high level [Bookmark: Phr2_O=12.1_D=24.2_C=0.78] . At page 43 of the 2024-25 annual report, there is a summary of the number of supervision orders commenced, completed and revoked each year, but the report does not break that down to the specific detail of HRO orders and interim HRO orders. The report notes that in the 2024-25 period [Bookmark: Phr3_O=37.1_D=4.7_C=0.81]  six extended supervision orders were commenced and none completed [Bookmark: Phr4_O=42.3_D=0.8_C=0.14]  or revoked.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=44.4_D=29.4_C=0.80] The 2024-25 annual report also includes some statistics on the number of reports completed for high-risk offenders and the number of high-risk offenders who are subject to electronic monitoring. Again, that data is not broken down to a detailed level. I can advise it is usually the case where criminal matters progress through the courts that they are subject to numerous ancillary [Bookmark: Phr6_O=74.3_D=29.8_C=0.81]  applications, for example, applications for adjournment. An application made under the proposed clause 5 would be ancillary to the primary application, which is the application for the HRO order itself. It would not be practical for all such ancillary applications to be reported on in annual reports. However, the Supreme Court does publish its decisions and reasons when it makes or refuses to [Bookmark: Phr7_O=104.7_D=15.3_C=0.78]  make an HRO order. It would be expected that if the court does approve an extension of time under the proposed provisions, it would set out its reasons for being satisfied that the extension of custody was necessary.
 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=123.3_D=3.4_C=0.65] 
In regard [Bookmark: Phr9_O=130.1_D=24.0_C=0.78]  to the engagement with the Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service (TALS), again another fulsome answer. The member for Nelson inquired whether the government had engaged with the Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service on the issue raised in its submission. As part of the usual consultation process on draft bills when the department writes to specific stakeholders [Bookmark: Phr10_O=155.0_D=1.2_C=0.82] , it seeks their feedback [Bookmark: Phr11_O=156.5_D=28.9_C=0.85] , as it did with TALS in relation to this bill. It invites them to contact the responsible departmental office if they have any questions in relation to the bill. This provides an opportunity for stakeholders to seek clarification and ensure their final submissions are directly relevant to the proposed provisions in the bill. Although other stakeholders did take up that offer to discuss specific concerns in person [Bookmark: Phr12_O=187.2_D=0.8_C=0.40] , the Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr13_O=188.4_D=30.0_C=0.77]  Aboriginal Legal Service did not contact the department in this instance.

The department carefully considers the issues raised in all submissions it receives to formulate advice for the minister's consideration and direction, but it is not usual practice to make direct contact with stakeholders to discuss their submissions once the formal consultation period has closed. The TALS' submission raised some issues that were [Bookmark: Phr14_O=218.6_D=26.0_C=0.78]  related to specific provisions of the bill, and these were considered and balanced against the submission of other stakeholders during the finalisation of those provisions. Significant parts of the TALS' submission raised broader concerns regarding the unique historical and social experiences that have shaped patterns of criminal behaviour in Aboriginal communities. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=245.1_D=4.4_C=0.81]  Matters of intervention, rehabilitation, treatment and reintegration [Bookmark: Phr16_O=250.0_D=29.9_C=0.84]  and wider engagement with the Aboriginal community. Those matters were beyond the scope of this bill, which makes a small number of targeted amendments to the act.

However, the TALS' submission was drawn to the attention of Community Corrections, given its role in working with offenders who are on community-based orders. My previous answer provided some detail around the approach that Community Corrections takes in working with offenders [Bookmark: Phr17_O=280.7_D=24.3_C=0.84]  who have a close connection to country and community. The government has ongoing engagement with TALS at the departmental level to collaborate across the justice and corrections portfolios and the Attorney-General and other ministers have personally met with the chief executive of TALS on several occasions to discuss a range of issues. The government is committed to engaging meaningfully with the Aboriginal community-controlled organisation sector in the provision of culturally appropriate support and programs for Aboriginal people in custody, as part of Tasmania's plan for Closing the Gap 2025-2028.

I thank the departmental people and the minister's adviser for putting those very detailed answers together.

Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move -

Motion agreed to.


REGISTRATION TO WORK WITH VULNERABLE PEOPLE AMENDMENT BILL 2025 (No. 60)

Second Reading

[5.47 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move -

That the bill be now read the second time.

This bill amends the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Act 2013, known as the RWVP act. This reflects one of the agreement items from the 15 August meeting of the Standing Council of Attorneys-General, known as SCAG, which was to urgently work towards implementation by the end of 2025 of mutual recognition of negative notices, known as declined applications or refusals of working with children checks, so that a person denied a check or whose check has been revoked in one jurisdiction cannot be granted or hold a working with children check in another jurisdiction.

Tasmania's RWVP act currently provides for a robust working with children and vulnerable people registration process. Ahead of its time, the act already provides that a person denied registration, or who has had their registration cancelled in another jurisdiction, cannot apply for registration in Tasmania for a period of five years, unless there has been a significant and exceptional change in circumstances.

Currently, when a person is already registered in Tasmania, an interstate decision to deny or cancel their equivalent registration would result in a risk assessment under our act. The government has already implemented amendments recommended by the commission of inquiry to ensure suspensions are used during the risk assessment process when appropriate. However, the SCAG agreement, with the Government's full support, is to take this a step further so the registrar must cancel a Tasmanian registration following interstate cancellation or suspension.

A consultation draft of the bill was prepared to ensure Tasmania's fulfilment of the SCAG agreement. The draft was released for both public and targeted consultation, with a total of 18 submissions received. The government appreciated both the support given for these important objectives and the stakeholders who raised issues for further consideration.

Of particular note was the interim Commissioner for Children and Young People's submission. All the commissioner's recommendations for the bill have been addressed, and other matters raised as part of the government's ongoing work as part of the SCAG agreement to harmonise processes with other jurisdictions. I will now go through the amendments made by the bill.

First, the bill provides under section 51 that the registrar must cancel a person's registration in a category of registration if the registrar is satisfied that, while the person holds registration in that category under the act, the person has been refused registration in an equivalent category of registration under a corresponding law, or the person's registration in an equivalent category of registration under a corresponding law has been cancelled. This amendment ensures that where a person is already registered in Tasmania, an interstate decision to deny or cancel their registration would result in immediate cancellation rather than a risk assessment, as is currently the case.

In addition to mutual recognition of refusals and cancellations, the bill goes further than the SCAG agreement to also enable the mutual recognition of suspensions under amendments to section 49, and what are known as 'interim bars' on people working while their application is being considered under section 18. This is in response to the submission made by the Commissioner for Children and Young People on the consultation draft, who noted the work of some other jurisdictions in this area. 

Suspensions are dealt with as part of the risk assessment process, which occurs when the relevant information about a person is obtained. Section 49 of the act deals with the grounds for suspension or cancellation of registration. The bill amends this section to introduce a new paragraph providing, for the avoidance of doubt, that the registrar must suspend a person's registration when conducting an additional risk assessment of the person on the grounds that the person's registration under a corresponding law has been suspended under that corresponding law.

The registrar can then see if the interstate decision progresses to a cancellation, in which case the bill ensures that the Tasmanian registration is also cancelled. The bill also introduces an amendment to section 20 to require applicants to proactively disclose any history of negative registration decisions in other jurisdictions. If an applicant does not disclose this history, it will still be uncovered through the current checking process. However, having a positive requirement for disclosure is a useful step. Any dishonest withholding of information in an application is relevant to the risk assessment process.

In response to a submission from the Commissioner for Children and Young People, a further amendment has been introduced in the bill to provide that people holding registration are required to disclose any history of negative notices in other jurisdictions. The bill includes a new section 47A, making it an offence for a registered person to fail to disclose these matters, similar to the current requirement to disclose offences.

Finally, the bill amends section 19 of the act. The current effect of section 19 of the act is that a person whose registration has been refused, or has had their registration cancelled under a corresponding law may only apply for registration if the application has been made after a period of five years has lapsed, or the registrar is satisfied that there has been significant and exceptional change in the person's circumstances.

Different jurisdictions have different requirements, such as different exclusion periods for reapplication following a refusal of an application for, or a cancellation of, a person's registration. The bill amends section 19 to restrict a person whose registration has been refused or who has had their registration cancelled under a corresponding law from applying for registration in equivalent categories in Tasmania for as long as they are ineligible to apply for registration under the corresponding law.

The consultation draft provided that this would be in addition to the current circumstances under which they are allowed to apply, namely after five years or if there are significant and exceptional circumstances. This is no longer the case in the tabled bill, following consideration of the submission of the Commissioner for Children and Young People. This provides for even greater consistency in the mutual recognition model.

It is also important to note that any applicant for registration in Tasmania is subject to a thorough risk assessment to determine whether they continue to present a risk to vulnerable people.

A new subsection 19(5) ensures that only the refusal or cancellation made in the original jurisdiction is considered by the registrar and not the resultant refusals or cancellations made by other jurisdictions mutually recognising the decision of the originating jurisdiction. This is so the eligibility to reapply is tied to the original jurisdiction that cancelled the registration or refused an application. It is also important to acknowledge the way in which procedural fairness is dealt with in the National Mutual Recognition Scheme. Appeal rights in relation to a decision under a corresponding law will continue to be exercised under that corresponding law.

Further, these are important new powers of the registrar and must be exercised carefully, as any powers are. For example, the registrar must be satisfied that a person's registration has been cancelled interstate before cancelling that person's registration here. It is an important principle of administrative law that if a decision maker makes an error in relation to the exercise of their powers, such as a case of mistaken identity, then the decision made has no legal effect and will be set aside by the decision maker. These amendments are part of a broader framework of reforms currently being led by the Standing Council of Attorneys-General in relation to Working with Children Checks.

Mr President, Tasmania will continue to contribute to the development of these very important reforms which aim to strengthen protection for children and achieve greater consistency between the Working with Children Check scheme across jurisdictions.

Consistent with the Standing Council of Attorneys-General agreement item, the amendments in this bill have been developed urgently with the aim of being implemented by the end of this year. The urgency recognises the crucial role these safeguards play in further enhancing the framework for ensuring the safety and protection of children and vulnerable people in our community.

Mr President, I commend the bill to the House.

[5.58 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, I rise to speak in support of the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Amendment Bill 2025. I understand the urgency and the nature of it and the briefings this morning to go through it in more rigorous detail.

This is not merely a technical amendment to our screening regime. In my view, this is Tasmania responding to a national agreement forged in the wake of some of the most harrowing child protection failures this country has ever witnessed. Whilst I acknowledge, sadly, the abuse of children and vulnerable people occurs in just about every setting you can imagine, including the family home, which we aren't going near in this, I'm going to speak about some of the most recent horrific examples.

Before I get to that, Madam Acting President, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General agreed in August 2025 to urgently implement mutual recognition of negative notices for Working with Children checks by the end of the year [Bookmark: Phr2_O=5.4_D=17.0_C=0.82] , and I'm pleased to see that Tasmania is acting to meet that commitment. I commend the government for acting as expeditiously on this and appreciate the feedback regarding the consultation, particularly taking on board the advice and suggestions from the the Interim Commissioner for Children and Young People.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=23.4_D=25.8_C=0.80] I want to be clear to my mind as much as anybody's why this really matters. We need to do all we can to close the gaps that have allowed predators to move between jurisdictions, exploiting the fact that our screening systems have operated in silos. In July this year, Victorians learned that Joshua Dale Brown had been charged more than 70 sex offences against eight children aged between five months [Bookmark: Phr4_O=49.9_D=0.8_C=0.78]  and two years. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=53.1_D=4.1_C=0.72]  He allegedly committed these crimes while working at a childcare centre in Point Cook [Bookmark: Phr6_O=57.7_D=3.1_C=0.86]  between April 2022 and January 2023 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=62.6_D=2.8_C=0.88] .

Here's what makes this case particularly disturbing [Bookmark: Phr8_O=66.2_D=4.6_C=0.60] : police believe Brown worked at 23 childcare centres across Melbourne [Bookmark: Phr9_O=71.8_D=5.4_C=0.74]  between January 2017 and May 2025 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=77.8_D=8.9_C=0.81]  - 23 centres, eight years - and throughout this entire period he held a valid Working with Children check. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=88.6_D=7.4_C=0.89]  Twelve hundred families were advised to have their children tested for infectious diseases as a precaution [Bookmark: Phr12_O=97.8_D=5.0_C=0.70] . The more I read about this I was [Bookmark: Phr13_O=105.2_D=1.5_C=0.56]  sickened by  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=107.5_D=4.0_C=0.88] it as a grandmother of children who go to childcare in Victoria. W [Bookmark: Phr15_O=112.2_D=3.6_C=0.90] hen I first saw this I went to look at the list [Bookmark: Phr16_O=117.1_D=11.7_C=0.78]  and was gratified that the centres my grandchildren have been in weren't on the list. However, that doesn't make a dot of difference to the 1200 families [Bookmark: Phr17_O=129.8_D=0.9_C=0.86]  that were.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=134.1_D=12.8_C=0.82] The reason they had to be tested for infectious diseases, as one media report of this, was because there were bodily fluids in the food the children were eating. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=149.9_D=4.0_C=0.62]  It just beggars' belief. I hope you all feel ill at the moment [Bookmark: Phr20_O=154.8_D=8.6_C=0.87]  because I did when I heard that. I forced myself to keep reading and listening to a podcast on it because I owed it to those children, those families [Bookmark: Phr21_O=165.0_D=15.6_C=0.79] , who had to suffer the lived experience. I had to read about it. I didn't have to. I chose to read it, but I chose to listen to it. I can't imagine what it would be like for those families. The more I learned the sicker I felt.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=181.7_D=5.0_C=0.86] My heart absolutely goes out to all those families and innocent children who were victims [Bookmark: Phr23_O=187.6_D=1.4_C=0.65] . A lifelong impact [Bookmark: Phr24_O=189.8_D=7.0_C=0.79]  is the lived reality for these families. They will never be able to move away from it. I know the fear I felt [Bookmark: Phr25_O=197.6_D=15.6_C=0.80]  hearing that it might have occurred at a childcare centre where one of my grandchildren was, at that age, little tackers, little kids, innocent, being sent there by their parents who loved them dearly, thinking they were safe [Bookmark: Phr26_O=213.7_D=5.8_C=0.77] . And that's what those parents did: sent those children to the daycare centres thinking they were safe.

 [Bookmark: Phr27_O=221.3_D=16.8_C=0.80] Less than a year before the Brown case emerged, a Queensland court sentenced Ashley Griffith to life in prison for what has been described as one of the worst paedophile cases in Australian history. Griffith pleaded guilty to 307 charges, including 28 counts of rape [Bookmark: Phr28_O=238.8_D=9.2_C=0.82]  involving 73 children he abused while working at childcare centres in Queensland and Italy between 2003 and 2022 [Bookmark: Phr29_O=249.5_D=5.3_C=0.80]  - 307 charges, 28 counts of rape of children [Bookmark: Phr30_O=255.5_D=1.4_C=0.77]  in a childcare centre [Bookmark: Phr31_O=258.4_D=1.4_C=0.85]  [Bookmark: Phr32_O=261.3_D=16.0_C=0.80] . Over a period of nearly 20 years, dozens of centres, 73 children. The judge described his crimes as horrendous and noticed the profound breach of trust involved. Throughout much of this offending, Griffith held the credentials required to work with our most vulnerable.
 [Bookmark: Phr33_O=278.6_D=25.1_C=0.74] 
Perhaps the most relevant to this bill before us is the case of Alexander Jones. In 2022, a Victorian Ombudsman investigation exposed what is called serious flaws in Victoria's Working with Children check scheme. Jones was investigated for multiple alleged sexual offences in New South Wales, including allegations of rape and sexually exporting children. [Bookmark: Phr34_O=304.0_D=0.8_C=0.88]  He was arrested and interviewed but never charged. When Jones applied for work in Victoria, his national police check was clean, because he'd never been charged. The New South Wales investigations didn't appear. Even more remarkably, the Ombudsman found that Victoria's legislation was so weak that even if authorities had known about the New South Wales investigations, they could not have refused his working with children clearance.

Clearly, we've had problems, and clearly this has been on the SCAGs radar for all the reasons we now understand. So many children, so many families, lifelong damage and harm. Jones went on to sexually assault a child in Victoria. The Ombudsman found that Victoria's screening authority had among the most limited powers in Australia and called the situation one where some painful lessons have been learned. For the safety of our children, more needs to be done.

These cases expose a fundamental flaw in our nation's approach to child safety. When someone's 'working with children check' is refused or cancelled in one jurisdiction, that information must be recognised across state and territory borders. I thank those who have sit around the table and do this hard work on our behalf at SCAG. We cannot allow perpetrators to simply relocate and obtain fresh credentials elsewhere. The amendments before us implement mutual recognition of negative notices. If someone has had their registration cancelled or refused in another Australian jurisdiction, that decision wouldn't be recognised here in Tasmania.

Our registrar will be required to cancel an equivalent Tasmanian registration when notified of an interstate cancellation or refusal. That's good. I'm sure that there is improved communication between the various bodies that operate our schemes. This is precisely the kind of interstate information sharing that might have prevented Alexander Jones from moving from New South Wales to Victoria and committing another offence. It's the kind of systemic reform called for by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse nearly a decade ago - the recommendation that Robert Fitzgerald, one of the commissioners, recently described as shamefully still unfulfilled at a national level. That's why I understand the urgency and that's why I'm happy to be dealing with this, now we're dealing with it.

Our commission of inquiry into abuse of children in state care also identified flaws. Tasmania does indeed have an obligation to act. We cannot allow a screening system to be any a weak link that enables someone refused registration elsewhere to work with other vulnerable people here. Equally, we have the responsibility to ensure that when our registrar makes a determination that someone poses an unacceptable risk here, that decision is also recognised interstate.

The August SCAG agreement set out an end-of-year deadline for implementation precisely because this urgency is evident. Children are being harmed. Families are being traumatised. Public confidence in children and youth services has been shattered by these cases. I just can't imagine the lived experience for so many of these people. The mainland case outlined demonstrates that perpetrators can and have worked across multiple centres, multiple states and multiple years while holding valid credentials. I went through the list with a fine-tooth comb, I will say, and I was appreciative of the Victorian government for publishing the names of the centres. In the Victorian case of Joshua Brown, he was a casual a lot of the time. He was only at some places for one day because he worked as a relief. This is one of the problems with these for-profit centres. Anyway, that's a separate topic and I won't go down that path.

I noted this bill responds to the immediate SCAG commitment on full recognition on negative notices, but I also note there are broad reforms needing this space, issues around information sharing between jurisdictions about investigations and allegations, not just completely determinations. The Victorian Ombudsman's findings make clear that our screening systems still have limitations. The screening systems do have limitations in protecting our children. As we know you, you will get a clean Working with Vulnerable People and Children card if you haven't been caught, it doesn't mean you haven't necessarily committed an offence, you just haven't been caught or haven't been caught yet. We do need to have other child safe systems robust to ensure as much as we possibly can that this doesn't happen. 

The principle underlying this bill is unassailable. We must close the interstate gaps that allow people assessed as unsuitable to work with children in one jurisdiction, to simply obtain a registration elsewhere. Every time we debate legislation in this place, we do so in the shadow of many failures. Failures that have devastated children and families. The Queensland case I mentioned involved nearly two decades of offending. The Victorian case has affected more than 1000 families and many, many children. The Alexander Jones case demonstrated how someone investigated for serious offences in one state, could still obtain a clearance in another.

This bill won't solve every problem in our child protection system, but it takes a necessary step towards ensuring our screening regimes work together rather than isolation. It honours Tasmania's commitment to the SCAG agreement, and it sends a clear message: that Tasmania will not be a destination where those refused registration elsewhere, can come here and start afresh. The protection of our vulnerable people, particularly children, must be our paramount concern. I thank the government for progressing this and I support the bill.

[6.11 p.m.]
Mr HISCUTT (Montgomery) - Mr President, I rise to make a brief contribution to this bill. As a board member for a not-for-profit childcare centre, I echo the statements made by the member for Murchison. It has sent shocks through the system completely and utterly, and it is abhorrent. I have no issues with the bill as presented and it's good to align with the SCAG as suggested. 

As a reminder, as spoken in the previous member's commentary, that it doesn't necessarily mean that offenders won't be able to get Working with Vulnerable People cards, only those that haven't yet been picked up will be caught under this. We need to be careful in that, that the requirement for vulnerable people doesn't negatively impact the vulnerable people that it is trying to protect as well, as in we have a high threshold for achieving it, and relatively - some would argue low, some would argue high - fees for that. I know circumstances in our local aged-care facility, their auxiliary group has members who are no longer committing to support that group because of the fees associated with getting a Working with Vulnerable Children card. I hope that the government notes those concerns in its future reviews as well.

It is good to see the government's consultation on the bill and its willingness to adhere to those consultations, and make adjustments as required. It is very important that we align with the other states and cross reference to avoid people potentially hopping between jurisdictions. I commend the bill and I look forward to seeing it go through, but as a reminder of making sure we don't do more harm for the people that we're trying to protect as well.

[6.13 p.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - Mr President, just as we did in the other place, the Greens are pleased to be supporting this Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Amendment Bill of 2025. We'd like to acknowledge the work of the Standing Council of Attorneys-General, provoked as they were, to take action given the horrific situation that was outlined by the member for Murchison.

These amendments, and in fact that decision by SCAG was made relatively recently. While ideally legislation has a longer consultation period than two weeks, I think we can all agree in here, that these amendments should be prioritised. They should not be contentious. They will harmonise our system to a significant extent with other jurisdictions so that if a person who has registration, or is applying for registration, has that registration denied or cancelled in another jurisdiction, then the registrar here - rather than conducting a risk assessment, which is provided for in the current act - must cancel that person's registration.

We acknowledge that very strong support for these amendments came from Carers Tasmania, the Tasmanian Bar Association, the Association of Massage Therapists, the Country Women's Association in Tasmania, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Centre for Excellence in Child and Family Welfare. We also want to acknowledge that the Interim Commissioner for Children and Young People was consulted and proposed further amendments which were accepted as part of this process. 

As I understand it, our amendments go further than other jurisdictions to this point, and I make the point that the original legislation was not necessarily nation-leading in 2013; but it went further than every other jurisdiction apart from the Australian Capital Territory. Until that point, Tasmania was the only jurisdiction in the country that didn't have a system of registration to work with children. I know this because I was the minister for human services at the time, and it took three years of fighting through Cabinet to have approval to establish this scheme through statute, and secure funding in the budget. 

At the time we made the decision not to restrict the registration scheme to children and young people because we recognised that vulnerability comes in many forms: people who are aged and have mobility challenges, who are isolated can be highly vulnerable. People who live with a disability, highly vulnerable. People from culturally and linguistically-diverse backgrounds, particularly older people of a called background, can be highly vulnerable.

We enacted legislation here in 2013 that created a scheme in eight parts, that established a registration to work with vulnerable people that began with the registration scheme for children and young people, and then over subsequent years included other cohorts of vulnerability into that registration scheme. As I said at the time, working with vulnerable people registration is not the panacea; it is one part, and an important part of a protective framework for vulnerable people. We have here now in Tasmania, as a result of the work of the commission of inquiry, the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Framework, a reportable conduct scheme, stronger obligations on employers to make sure that their organisations are child safe, and that where there is conduct that potentially puts a vulnerable person at risk, then it is mandatorily reported.

As a result of that horrific and extensive abuse of trust outlined by the honourable member for Murchison, as I understand it, both Victoria and New South Wales are now moving towards a mandatory training regime, if you like, for people who seek registration, whether they be paid employees or volunteer employees, and I ask the Leader for the Government to respond to a question that was raised in the briefing this morning, on the record, about moves to ensure that a person who receives registration to work with vulnerable people is provided with training that makes it clear what appropriate conduct is, how to identify the risk, and how to make sure that you, as the person with the registration, are not acting in a way that exposes a vulnerable person to risk.

I've had stakeholders come to us and ask why isn't Tasmania making sure that people who have a registration to work with vulnerable people are trained [Bookmark: Phr2_O=11.8_D=13.9_C=0.87] .

I understand that because we have a Child and Youth Safe Organisations Framework in place, as a result of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.6_D=0.8_C=0.86]  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=33.6_D=12.5_C=0.82] , that there are obligations on employers to make sure that their employees are not posing a risk to children and young people [Bookmark: Phr5_O=47.3_D=1.4_C=0.84] , because they have to be child safe organisations. However,  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=50.4_D=22.4_C=0.82] what do we know about how extensive and effective that training is? Is it simply to be a child safe organisation and to comply? Is it a one-off, every year training? I know that in some government agencies, for example, there are training modules that are provided  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=74.0_D=2.4_C=0.93] online, and I wonder how effective they are. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=78.2_D=1.3_C=0.84]  I think that [Bookmark: Phr9_O=81.2_D=13.2_C=0.88]  people with a lived experience of being abused or harmed should be able to inform whatever training module we may put in place [Bookmark: Phr10_O=95.3_D=13.3_C=0.89]  for people who are registered to work with vulnerable people. 

I have some questions just relating to the scheme generally [Bookmark: Phr11_O=109.3_D=5.9_C=0.91] , honourable Leader: is it possible to provide Council with information about how many people were reported [Bookmark: Phr12_O=117.0_D=23.2_C=0.81]  to the registrar this year, and that is this measurable financial year that's just passed, for inappropriate behaviours towards a vulnerable person, including child grooming, harm and abuse? How many investigations following those notifications were undertaken by the registrar [Bookmark: Phr13_O=140.6_D=0.9_C=0.89] , given that [Bookmark: Phr14_O=143.2_D=5.0_C=0.73]  they'd have to undertake a risk assessment on the basis of the information that's been provided to them [Bookmark: Phr15_O=150.2_D=9.6_C=0.76] ? Did those notifications and any subsequent assessments result in referrals to the Director of Public Prosecutions? [Bookmark: Phr16_O=161.4_D=14.5_C=0.85]  Were any charges laid, as far as the Leader for Government's advice could provide for, and over that past year, how many registrations to work with vulnerable people were cancelled? [Bookmark: Phr17_O=178.3_D=0.6_C=0.83]  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=181.1_D=13.9_C=0.82]  

Given that we know the registration process is much more than a police check, and at its best is a thorough and integrated risk assessment [Bookmark: Phr19_O=196.5_D=2.2_C=0.79] , can the Leader for Government explain [Bookmark: Phr20_O=201.5_D=9.8_C=0.86]  what is taken into account by the registrar in the risk assessment process and how that will change as a result [Bookmark: Phr21_O=211.5_D=17.7_C=0.85]  of the amendments, given that the amendment provides for the immediate cancellation or denial of registration following an adverse or a negative determination in another jurisdiction? So, just to provide some [Bookmark: Phr22_O=231.1_D=7.8_C=0.91]  layered information about the risk assessment process, because we know tha [Bookmark: Phr23_O=242.2_D=1.4_C=0.47]  [Bookmark: Phr24_O=245.3_D=1.4_C=0.62] t there are predators everywhere.

 [Bookmark: Phr25_O=247.8_D=2.2_C=0.54] As a paren [Bookmark: Phr27_O=254.5_D=26.0_C=0.78] t, when you send your kids off into the world to childcare or to school, you want to believe that they're in good hands and that they will be safe. The registration to work with vulnerable people is one part of that reassurance; so is the child safe organisations and reportable conduct scheme, but there are cultural issues here in Tasmania too. 

 [Bookmark: Phr28_O=281.9_D=2.2_C=0.78] These amendments are positive [Bookmark: Phr29_O=284.5_D=10.2_C=0.69]  and overdue because it has been 12 years since the principal act was passed by parliament unamended [Bookmark: Phr30_O=296.5_D=8.5_C=0.91] . These changes are really important. What we heard this morning in the briefing was that the technology that's behind the capacity to prevent a predator with a registration card in their pocket from harming a vulnerable person is held by the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission and there is a National Reference System database. As we understood from the briefing this morning, that database is regularly updated and there's a process here in Tasmania, through the registrar of checking in with that database.

I would like clarity about how that works. Is it that in another jurisdiction a person has their registration denied or cancelled and fed into the national database? Is there a notification process for other jurisdictions? Or is it something that requires active checking with the National Reference System database?

With those few words and questions, I'm glad to be able to support this strengthening and improvement to the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Act of 2013. I am impressed by the Standing Council of Attorneys-General taking such speedy action. They're not known for it as a ministerial council. But not that long after Australians were revolted and horrified by the abuse of so many small people by someone who parents entrusted their babies to the SCAG has presented to jurisdictions around the country, a model for harmonisation that will provide one extra layer of protection for children and young people. But that protection, as we know, is a responsibility that falls on us all, all the time.

These are good amendments. I am very happy to support them.

I want to, in closing, acknowledge that it is National Survivors Day, where we honour the lives and the courage of survivors of sexual assault and institutional abuse, their supporters and their whistleblowers.

There's a particular young Tasmanian who is in my mind now whose evidence to the commission of inquiry was catalytic to its findings. Whose abuser had a Registration to Work with Vulnerable People card, whose life, whose childhood was shattered, who was let down by the state at multiple levels, not least of which her abuser was known by people in positions of authority to be behaving inappropriately towards this young person. Who was let down by the state, was let down by Tasmania Police, was let down by the Registrar to Work with Vulnerable People. I often think of this brave young woman, the courage required of her, to survive that, to endure it, and then to stand before the world and tell your story. That's some courage.

Mr President, on this National Survivors Day, I honour and acknowledge all survivors of sexual assault and childhood abuse. I acknowledge their trauma is lifelong.

[6.30 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I also add my acknowledgement that it's National Survivors' Day. I particularly acknowledge the member for Murchison for having the courage to share the fact that she read and listened to that horrific story. I expect that just to have it on the public record would give people a real understanding of why this legislation is so important, and why these amendments are important to that legislation from your time. 

Ms O'Connor - From the old days.

Ms RATTRAY - From back in the day. I thank the member for Hobart as well for reminding us of that history and where this originally came from. When she said it took three years through the Cabinet process to finally get it through and then get it funded, it seems astonishing now that it wasn't just - 

Ms O'Connor - It certainly does, doesn't it, in the context of the commission of inquiry. 

Ms RATTRAY - But, we're here where we are. Again, the member for Murchison noted that the working with children check is just one element in ensuring safety for children, and if the check is relied upon as the sole means of protecting children, then there will be a gap in their safety. The government acknowledges this and would emphasise that the check must work together with other important safeguards such as the Child and Youth Safe Organisation Framework. The framework places a range of obligations on organisations to ensure their environments are childsafe. 

The Independent Regulator oversees the Child and Youth Safe Organisation Framework, and the Independent Regulator and the registrar work closely together to share information for the purposes of protecting children in Tasmania. 

To Ms O'Connor, the member for Hobart, on training for people who work with children: the matter of training for people who work with children is an important one which will be considered by SCAG. Training in education is required under schedule 1 of the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Act, and this requires relevant organisations to comply with that and other national standards. The regulator under that act has appropriate powers to investigate.

In response to the question on the operational statistics: a person qualified under the mutual recognition process will only be able to apply once they are again eligible in the jurisdiction that made the initial decision. The facts and circumstances of the reason why a negative decision was made will be reviewed by the registrar in Tasmania to ensure that there is not an ongoing risk to children before the WWCC is granted.

Another question: under the scheme, how does the registrar know if a person is already registered in Tasmania and subsequently has a registration refused or cancelled in another jurisdiction? Will this change as a result of these amendments? The National Police Reference System (NPRS) [ok] is administered by the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) and records all negative working with children check decisions made by state and territory screening units, apart from the NT, which is yet to connect with the NPRS. Tasmania's RWVP IT system does weekly sweeps of the NPRS for decisions relevant to applications and registrants in the RWVP system, and when matches are found, relevant mutual-recognition or risk-assessment processes can proceed. I know that there is a number of other answers to questions coming and I will just grab those. 

Following on from my last answer, what is taken into account in a risk assessment? The registrar may take into account the following when conducting a risk assessment:

a person's criminal history and the non-conviction information;
criminal intelligence information;
a person's past reportable behaviour; and
anything else that the registrar considers relevant.

With regard to the RWVP statistics for 2024-25, as at 30 June, 198,500 people are registered to work with vulnerable people in Tasmania. As a result, six reports were made to the registrar and 3284 additional risk assessments were commenced. Forty-four individuals had their registration suspended and 24 had their registrations cancelled. 

Ms O'Connor - Leader for the government, did you say 44 had registrations suspended and 24 cancelled?

Ms RATTRAY - Forty-four individuals suspended and 24 had their registrations cancelled.

Ms O'Connor - I also asked if any referrals had been made to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Are you able to -

Ms RATTRAY - I will check on that. Unless I can get something, I will be back. 

With regard to that additional question, the referrals don't go from the registrar, they go to Tasmania Police and the referrals then go from Tasmania Police to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I could attempt to get that information from Tasmania Police, but I probably won't be able to get it right now.

Ms O'Connor - Okay. I'm happy with that. I'm not going to hold up the bill on the basis of that, but if that information could be provided at some point, that would be -

Ms RATTRAY - I am sure that can be sourced. I will ask my office to find that information and get that back to the honourable member.

Ms O'Connor - Thank you.

Ms RATTRAY - Mr President, I commend the bill to the House.

Bill read the second time.


REGISTRATION TO WORK WITH VULNERABLE PEOPLE AMENDMENT BILL 2025 (No. 60)

In Committee

[6.38 p.m.]
Clauses 1, 2 and 3 agreed to.

Clause 4 -

Ms O'CONNOR - I note the use of a particular word in this clause. In (4) it says:

(a)	the Registrar reasonably suspects that the applicant may be -

(i)	refused registration; or 

(ii)	issued with a negative notice. [TBC]

This is an interesting shift in legal language because 'suspects' is the correct word to use in this context, but in other legislation which we've seen go through lately, for example, the knives bill will change the test for Tasmania Police to be from one where they have a 'reasonable suspicion' that a person carries a knife, to a 'reasonable belief'. In evidence terms, to 'believe' we can believe anything, but to form a suspicion, there has to be at least some foundation of evidence there.

In a way, I'm noting that because we've seen it again, in the explosives bill, where the test is changed from Tasmania Police having to form a reasonable suspicion and that means their action would have to stand up in court, to forming a reasonable belief. 

In this legislation we're stuck with a much more legally precise and correct term that is that the registrar has to form a suspicion and suspects that the person would have their application refused or reissued. I'm interested to know on what basis the government is comfortable using the word 'suspects' here, yet when we're expanding police powers, we want to let the police form a belief before, for example, they (inaudible) a young person.

Ms RATTRAY - I acknowledge the member for Hobart's observation and this amendment does expand 18(4) [TBC] but continues to use the current test of 'reasonably suspects'. Using 'belief' would be at a higher threshold, and not appropriate for the RWVP risk assessment. Does that answer the member's question? I can seek further clarification, or I can read it again.

Ms O'CONNOR - It's not something to get caught up on, but I wouldn't have thought that belief was the higher threshold.

Ms RATTRAY - Belief would be a higher threshold, that's what I said. Belief would be a higher threshold and it's not appropriate for the RWVP risk assessment.

Ms O'CONNOR - Okay, thank you. You're sort of agreeing with me?

TERRORISM LEGISLATION (EXTENSION) BILL 2025 (No. 52)

Second Reading
 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=114.3_D=13.4_C=0.61] 

[6.50 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I indicate to the House I will read the second reading speech and then I will move to adjourn the debate.

Mr President, I move -

That the bill be now read a second time.

This bill contains amendments that extend the operation of the Police Powers (Public Safety) Act 2005 and the Terrorism (Preventative Detention) Act 2005 for a period of five years to 31 December [Bookmark: Phr9_O=159.1_D=15.6_C=0.88]  2030. Both acts are due to expire at the end of this year. It is legislation like this that makes us pause and reflect about some of the biggest world events over the last 25 years and how we as a country and as a state responded.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=174.9_D=29.9_C=0.83] It also causes us to look forward and consider what protections are necessary to ensure our police, law enforcement, intelligence and prosecution agencies are appropriately equipped to respond to threats and acts of terrorism. 

Following the 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre and Pentagon in the United States and the the 2002 Bali bombings, Australian states and territories signed the Intergovernmental Agreement on Counter Terrorism [Bookmark: Phr11_O=204.9_D=30.0_C=0.82]  Law in 2004. This led to the introduction of state-based counter terrorism legislation to include the expansion of police powers in certain circumstances and a preventative detention regime. As a result, the public safety act and the preventative detention act were introduced in Tasmania in 2005.

The introduction of the regime on a national basis was to ensure that there is consistency in relation to the powers available to our [Bookmark: Phr12_O=235.0_D=29.9_C=0.82]  security agencies and there are no vulnerabilities in the ability of any jurisdiction to protect its community against terrorist acts. In Tasmania, the public safety act provides police officers with necessary powers to ensure the safety of the public where there is a potential terrorist threat to a significant event or essential infrastructure, or where a terrorist act has occurred. Following a grant of authorisation police [Bookmark: Phr13_O=265.1_D=29.9_C=0.85]  officers can stop, search and question people, search vehicles and seize and detain things.

The preventative detention act provides for an authorised person to seek the detention of a person for up to 14 days in order to prevent an imminent terrorist act occurring or preserve evidence of or relating to a recent terrorist attack. Both acts contain appropriate safeguards. For example, the public safety act requires approval [Bookmark: Phr14_O=295.3_D=9.7_C=0.83]  of the premier and in some cases the Supreme Court to exercise the range of powers. The Preventative Detention Act restricts multiple preventative detention orders being made and provides that a detainee may apply to the Supreme Court for revocation of or variant of an order. A preventative detention order cannot be made in relation to a person who is under 16 years of age, and a person detained is entitled to contact the Ombudsman and a lawyer to obtain legal advice. A person detained under a preventative detention order must be treated with humanity and respect for human dignity and must not be subjected to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.

Neither act has been used in Tasmania to date and in fact preventative detention orders, or PDOs, have been used sparingly around the country. This supports the intended purpose of the acts to be extraordinary measures used in very serious circumstances. Three PDOs have been issued in New South Wales in 2014 and one in Victoria in 2015. Both acts are set to expire in 2015 on the 10th anniversary of the day of commencement. 

The act includes a sunset clause to ensure they will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny should they be made. This is because of the extraordinary measures and powers provided for in the act. They depart from the usual warrant-based authorisation requirements and therefore governments around Australia have mandated that they be reviewed regularly. They were extended to 31 December 2025 following the final report of the Council of Australian Government Review of Counter Terrorism Legislation in 2013 and the second annual report of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor in 2012. These reports agreed that PDOs should be retained as their ongoing availability would ensure that law enforcement agencies had a legal basis on which to take action to prevent a terrorist attack or preserve evidence in the immediate aftermath of a terrorist attack, where an arrest or a prosecution is not considered to be open, but a person nonetheless presents a credible risk to public safety.

Some procedural and technical amendments were made to the preventative detention act at this time, for example, providing that both the applicant and the senior police officer or Supreme Court must be satisfied that it is reasonably necessary, as opposed to necessary, to detain the person to preserve evidence relating to a terrorist attack. Another change was enabling police officers to apply for PDOs orally or electronically, in urgent circumstances. No substantive changes were made to the Police Powers (Public Safety) Act 2005.

Mr President, since 2015 there have been various reviews conducted in other states as well as at the Commonwealth level. The Victorian government appointed an expert panel to consider terrorism and violent extremism prevention and response powers in 2017 which handed down two reports. In 2017, the New South Wales state coroner handed down findings and recommendations from the inquest into the deaths arising from the Lindt Cafe siege in 2014. Also, in 2017, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor conducted reviews of the Commonwealth's police powers and PDO regime. In 2018 and 2021, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security considered the Commonwealth police powers and PDO regime.

The overall message from these various reviews is that a conclusion of redundancy does not automatically follow from the non-use of a particular law enforcement tool. The reviews found that the powers afforded to the police under the public safety act and preventative detention act are necessary and should continue. They are important tools in the belt for our police and other law enforcement, intelligence and prosecution agencies. This is supported by the position of other states and territories. Equivalent legislation in Queensland expires in 2040; Victoria in 2031; and the Australian Capital Territory in 2027; the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Northern Territory in 2026; and South Australia and Western Australia at the end of 2025. South Australia intends to extend its legislation for 10 years and Western Australia for two years to synchronise their respective acts which currently have different expiry dates.

I note that the bill was amended in the other place to reduce the extension period from 10 years to five years. Currently, Australia's general terrorism threat level is probable, that is, there is a greater than 50 per cent chance of an onshore attack or attack planning in the next 12 months. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) notes Australia's security landscape has entered a vulnerable period and is being challenged by new threats with concerning trajectories. Our landscape is a reflection of the social and political environment in which we live. Social cohesion is lower and trust in governments and democratic processes globally is eroding.

ASIO is observing the emergence of domestic actors increasingly driven to act by sociopolitical issues intersecting with personal grievances. There is an increase in extremism fuelled by conspiracy theories or anti-authority ideologies. Some actors hold a blend of ideologies, including those that justify acts of violence to influence change. Although the threat to Tasmania and Australia has evolved since 2005, it remains real. It is marked by an increase in the threat of smaller scale opportunistic attacks by lone actors and often driven by social media. For example, in the last couple of years we have seen in the media the first criminal prosecutions of persons conducting a Nazi salute in Victoria and the Australia Capital Territory, the first conviction of a person transmitting violent extremist material online in Western Australia, the Melbourne synagogue arson attack in December of 2024, and various prosecutions of young people possessing violent extremist material in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.

The bill is important for this reason. It will retain Tasmania's security framework and preserve national consistency. I conclude by highlighting the ongoing work in this space across the country to ensure counterterrorism legislation remains fit for purpose. Western Australia is currently undertaking a statutory review of its legislation and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is undertaking a review of the definition of a terrorist act in the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995. Importantly, this definition is used in Tasmania's public safety act and the preventative detention act. Relevant Tasmanian agencies are contributing to this review. 

The government is committed to ensuring this legislation remains effective and will consider the findings of the various reviews in determining whether further reform of these acts in a future bill would improve their operation. I commend the bill to the House.
