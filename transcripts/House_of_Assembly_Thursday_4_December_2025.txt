LEAVE OF ABSENCE

[10.02 a.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Speaker, in the absence of minister Vincent today due to illness, I will be taking questions on his portfolio responsibilities.


QUESTIONS

North Launceston Football Club - Minister's Comments

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for SPORT, Mr DUIGAN

[10.02 a.m.]
I'd like to acknowledge the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) members in the gallery. It's in Labor's DNA to back workers, and we're strongly behind our public sector workers and the work they're doing in our communities. Thank you.

Minister, on Tuesday night you said the North Launceston Football Club clearly indicated it had a preference for a particular course of action that wasn't reflected in the draft letter you sent to the President, but North Launceston was clear with you that they wanted to keep all options open and accepted your offer in good faith. How did North Launceston tell you they didn't want the $100,000?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. The government has always been a strong supporter of the North Launceston Football Club and, of course, sport in general. 

I am aware of some comments I made during budget Estimates and in the House of Assembly have caused some concern. For that, I offer my unreserved apology. I would accept that those words were poorly chosen, and I would accept that that fault lies squarely with me. 

In answer to a question from Mr Winter in budget Estimates, I said the following:

I believe Mr Hall, shortly after I sent him that letter, went out and stood next to you as you provided an alternative for him. And that's important. On the basis of that, I chose not to sign my letter.

On reflection, as I say, that was a poor choice of words, and for this I apologise. The events that unfolded with the North Launceston Football Club occurred in the thick of an election campaign where a number of conversations occur. I should have clarified that what I meant by my answer to Mr Winter was that I didn't sign the letter on the basis that the club had made it clear that they had an alternate proposal to the one we had been discussing, the position I had articulated in my draft letter to the club President. It was never my intention in my actions during the campaign, nor in the statements I've made since, that I didn't sign the letter because Mr Hall stood with Mr Winter during the campaign.

Mr Willie - That's what you said. 

The SPEAKER - Order. Sorry, minister - 

Mr DUIGAN - I regret that my answers may have given the North Launceston Football -

The SPEAKER - Honourable members of the opposition, interjections will cease because I cannot hear what the honourable member is saying because of the constant interjections from my left.

Mr DUIGAN - I regret that my answers may have given the North Launceston Football Club or the general public the impression that I would ever seek to punish a club in the decisions I make for meeting with other members of parliament, as is their clear right. This is not how I operate.

My absolute focus has always been and remains finding an outcome for the club that is mutually beneficial and agreeable. I met the North Launceston president on site at Inveresk last week and I wait with interest for the outcome of the annual general meeting of the club next Wednesday to seek to be given more clarity on what the club would see as its preferred option.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - How did North Launceston Football Club tell you that they didn't want the $100,000?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Minister for Sport, that was part of the original question.

Mr DUIGAN - In conversations through the course of the election campaign, as we say, these things move quickly. I shared my draft letter with the club and with the Northern Tasmanian Football Association (NTFA). I suspect Mr Winter shared his position -

Mr Willie - How did they tell you -

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr DUIGAN - Through the course of the campaign, the club made it clear that the -

Ms Finlay - How?

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition, this is your first warning. I appreciate we're all tired. I want all members to be heard in silence, please.

Mr DUIGAN - That the position offered by Mr Winter was the preferred position of the club.


North Launceston Football Club - Minister's Comments

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER FOR SPORT, Mr DUIGAN 

[10.07 a.m.]
I have a statement from the President of the North Launceston Football Club that says:

Regardless of what I might have achieved with Labor should they have been elected, I had an arrangement with minister Duigan that was unambiguous, not simply election hyperbole, and it should be honoured with haste lest we find ourselves without a home.

North Launceston says they have an arrangement with you that was unambiguous and should be honoured regardless of what was on the table from Labor. Why are you now trying to change your story?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, we are, and I am, as Minister for Sport, absolutely committed to an outcome for North Launceston Football Club. I don't resile from anything that was in my letter. But what I will do -

Mr Winter - You don't resile from it? Where is -

The SPEAKER - Honourable member for Franklin, this is your first warning.

Mr DUIGAN - as asked of me in writing as recently as this week, is wait for the club to have its annual general meeting where the President and the board will seek agreement from the membership on the proposed way forward. Once we know what the club would like to see done, what the club would like to see in its future, I will be more than happy to take that on board and work with the club to deliver an outcome that suits everybody. 

This is so important. This is a club that has been in the Launceston community for 103 years. I am committed to a home for North Launceston in the long term. I will certainly see that they have accommodation -

Mr Willie - Political payback is what you're committed to.

The SPEAKER - Honourable Leader of the Opposition.

Mr DUIGAN - at York Park until such time as new accommodation or a resolution is made. We will continue as a government to support all our sporting organisations.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?
The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - The minister previously said he cancelled the funding because the club stood with Labor in the media. Now he's saying that the club has a different preference. Why is he changing his story?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Minister for Sport.

Mr DUIGAN - Certainly, I am not saying I cancelled any funding. Absolutely not. Should the club come to that understanding that it would like to see some preliminary work done, potentially, at York Park, that's something we can work together with -

Mr Winter - They are saying it.

Mr DUIGAN -No, in fact, they're not. They are saying that they would like the membership to have a say -

Ms Finlay - After you let them down; they now have to make a decision.

The SPEAKER - Honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition, this is your second warning.

Mr DUIGAN - As I say, we will await the outcome of the annual general meeting. I would expect Mr Hall and the club board to make a representation potentially to Stadiums Tasmania as the owners and managers of UTAS Stadium, or subsequently to my office. We will seek, as I continue to say, to progress an outcome for the club, which in all of this is the most important.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time has expired.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Impact on BGE and SOC Budgets

Mr BAYLEY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.11 a.m.]
To get the vote you need on the Macquarie Point stadium, you wrote to the member for Huon and committed to:

… reducing public non-financial corporations net borrowings between 2026-27 and 2028-29 by a cumulative total of $500 million (broadly equating to the Mac Point borrowings of $490.7 million). [tbc]

You've said essential services won't be sacrificed to pay for the stadium, while at the same time committing to cut the very public service jobs that provide those services. Now you're putting the services Tasmania's government businesses provide on the stadium chopping block. Tasmanians know they can't take you for your word. This is an opportunity to be honest with the public. Specifically, are you planning to forgo building new homes by Homes Tasmania in the forward years? Are you prioritising a roofed stadium before Tasmanians unable to put a roof over their own heads?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. The answer to that is no. We are prioritising delivering the social services that Tasmanians care about, whether that be schools, teachers, hospitals, health facilities across Tasmania, community safety, of course, roads, bridges and all the social infrastructure that is important and Tasmanians quite rightly deserve.

Why do I say we're always prioritising that? Because our record speaks for itself. We have employed more frontline staff across our health system, within our schools, right across our investment in keeping our young people safe and supported to thrive, and when it comes to investment in our emergency services as well. We can do both when it comes to investing in the enabling infrastructure that allows us to grow our economy, keep people employed and increase employment in fact. 

I acknowledge the workers as well, Mr Willie, who are in the gallery today and I acknowledge their contribution across our public service, but also the contribution of every employee in Tasmania and over the course of the last 10 years, there was 51,000 more of them contributing to the Tasmanian economy.

This is about being very open, sensibly managing our budget and of course expecting our government businesses to also manage their budgets accordingly as well. You can read online that in Victoria there are significant savings across the public service there, for example - and hank goodness we're not in the situation of Victoria. We will manage our finances on the back of significant investment to keep people alive, safe and well through the pandemic, but now we need to ensure that we have the right sized public service. It's not prioritising one over the other. We will always prioritise the essential services, but we need to invest in enabling infrastructure to keep our economy growing, which it is.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr BAYLEY - With respect, Premier, that was a pretty slippery answer. You answered no, and then went on to list schools, teachers, health facilities, roads and bridges, none of which are delivered by our GBEs or public non-financial corporations. I ask again, specifically, are you planning to forgo building new homes by Homes Tasmania? Is Homes Tasmania's borrowings one of the things that's going to be managed downwards over the coming years, and what will be the impact on their capacity to build homes?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Premier. 
 
Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you for the question. We will continue building homes in Tasmania and any investment in the stadium will not sacrifice any homes being built. We're going to continue with our very strong plan when it comes to putting roofs over people's heads, because I've always said that every single Tasmanian has the fundamental right to be safe and have a roof over their heads. That's what we've been working through. We had a conversation - Dr Broad was talking about supply of housing just yesterday in one of the debates about -

Dr Broad - UTAS.

Mr ROCKLIFF - UTAS. Thank you. See, I do listen to you occasionally. You're right on supply, I have to say, and that's what we've been doing very diligently -

Mr Bayley - So, Homes Tasmania won't have to reduce their borrowings, is that what you're saying?

Mr ROCKLIFF - over the course of the last few years.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Promise to Member for Huon

Ms JOHNSTON question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[10.16 a.m.]
You will say and pay anything to secure a stadium vote. In a letter to the honourable member for Huon, Dean Harriss, you promised to increase own-source revenue in return for his 'yes' vote, but how can you do that when you've promised Tasmanians not to introduce new taxes or increase existing taxes? You have had to admit there's no modelling to support your claims that a windfall from stamp duty or payroll tax will be enough to pay the stadium interest bill. There's a problem here, Treasurer. Your promises are at odds. You're going to have to break one of these promises to either Mr Harriss or Tasmanians. My question is, who will it be?

ANSWER

As is the wont of the member for Clark, she likes to give a binary choice when in fact it's not a binary choice and there are circumstances apart from that which she asserts in her question. Speaker, I will start by thanking Mr Harriss for his discussions with us as a government and coming to a landing which - should the vote go ahead in the Legislative Council today - will allow a substantial economic enabler for our state. Part and parcel -

Dr Woodruff - Shame.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, the Greens say shame. 

Dr Woodruff - Absolutely.

The SPEAKER - Order, Dr Woodruff.

Dr Woodruff - The Planning Commission says its garbage.

Mr ABETZ - When you say economic enabler, what is the Greens' response? 'Shame.' How do we get to the position where we have members -
The SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff, this is your first warning.

Mr ABETZ - in this House who don't want economic enabling? What I would say to the honourable member is that part and parcel of our dealings with Mr Harriss was to ensure that we get that economic enabling occurring, which will be so transformative, not only for the cityscape but for our social, cultural, and sporting life in this state, and it will make a genuine and real difference.

Mr Harriss has expressed concerns in relation to the Budget and indeed during Estimates, I think there was this play on words on the front of the Mercury saying, 'Treasurer hedges his Abetz,' or something like that, in relation to taxation. I've been quite clear in relation to that, that there was no closing of doors, and as I am wont to say from time to time, I do say it and people then suggest that that has a particular meaning, but never say never. We are open on this side to have a look at what we can do to increase self-funded resources, knowing that only about one-third of our budgetary expenditure comes from our own sources and two-thirds comes from Canberra via GST and specific-purpose payments.

What we have with Mr Harriss is an agreement. In case there is any confusion, I'm more than happy to table in this House the letter from Mr Harriss to the Premier and myself and the response from the Premier and myself, so it can be absolutely clear for everybody to see and read. I note that Mr Harriss did the same in the upper House yesterday.

Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms JOHNSTON - In his contribution there and the answer, the Treasurer indicated that he wants to be absolutely clear. However, it's very unclear. In your letter to Mr Harriss, it says that the state government agrees to implement all recommendations of the Eslake report with the exception of the report's specific recommendations for new and increased taxes. Which is it, are you increasing taxes or not increasing taxes?

You also have to admit that you have said there is no modelling to show that the economic enabler that the stadium claims to be will actually increase revenue to state coffers. Which is it, are you breaking your promise to Mr Harriss or are you breaking your promise to Tasmanians?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - Speaker, as I've been able to disabuse the honourable member in relation to her statement previously and I do so again, we know that the AFL payroll, will be $44 million. On that, they will be paying $2.6 million per annum as payroll tax.

So, please do not assert that there is no income coming back to Tasmanians from this venture. As I've also said previously, there will be undoubtedly a new hotel built on the back of this development. That hotel will employ staff, they will have a payroll, they will pay payroll tax, there will be new developments on which stamp duty will be paid and with the economic activity, there will be a GST stimulus as well and a population stimulus.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Treasurer's time has expired.


Short Stay Levy to Fund First Home Buyer Grants

Mr O'BYRNE question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[10.22 a.m.]
The condition of the budget has been a focus of many debates over the last few weeks, with the level of debt confronting both this parliament and the broader community. Recent contributions heard in this House and the other place have expressed a willingness to consider taxes to fund our essential services.

Treasurer, your government committed to a new tax in the form of a short stay levy, with the revenue applied to the first home buyer grants. Instead of redistributing this money away from government, you could put the revenue into essential services such as homelessness services. Going on the contributions over the last few days, the latter course of action is in line with the will of the parliament. This levy would raise revenue from a sector of the economy that has the most to gain from the construction of Macquarie Point Stadium. Treasurer, will you now commit to using money raised through this levy to fund homelessness services?

ANSWER

I'm sorry to disappoint member for Franklin, Mr O'Byrne, he'll have a long Christmas and then a wait until 21 May next year when the budget will be delivered. I'm not going to be ruling anything in or out prior to that time, other than in general terms. The member is right when he talks about the short stay levy. That will raise $11 million and we hope to have that in place and operational by 1 July next year, and that will then provide us with the amounts that the member referred to. How that will be applied will be stated in the budget.


Salmon Industry - Florfenicol Use Impact on Rock Lobster Fishery

Mr GEORGE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.24 a.m.]
In budget Estimates on 17 November, the Premier told the committee that the closure of the commercial rock lobster industry in the south of the D'Entrecasteaux Channel was for, 'a short term only,' though how you actually claimed this without any evidence remains a mystery.

Premier, are you aware that the antibiotic treatment began again yesterday in yet more diseased pens in the same lease area, while Tassal is now applying to use antibiotics in Okehampton Bay? Premier, has this short-term closure of the rock lobster industry in the south of the D'Entrecasteaux Channel come to an end or when will it? What are the results from testing lobster flesh for antibiotic residue and what risk is there of more areas being closed due to salmon farming disease and antibiotic treatment?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. For a large part of that question, about testing and the like, I will have to take on notice and get that information for you.

Can I also say that we value the salmon industry here in Tasmania for the people that it employs in rural and regional Tasmania in particular, but also elsewhere. The monitoring, honestly, is extraordinary. If you go to the marine board building, you can see the underwater cameras and all sorts of matters. As I said the other day, I went to the Huon Valley - or Kingborough, wherever it was - and saw a fantastic innovative business that -

Ms Ogilvie - SoSub.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes. Fixes the nets as well as - it was an extraordinary innovation, which I believe they're exporting to other countries, which is amazing.

Also, the lobster industry is a highly valuable industry for Tasmania, and it's been under some challenges since just before COVID and through those COVID years. We welcome market access back and I thank the combination of state and federal governments' full-out advocacy in one particular market.

Can I say, though, more broadly, that no-one wants to see a repeat of last summer's mass-mortality event. It was devastating for the fish themselves, and for the workers and devastating for many, many reasons both economically and for animal welfare. In early November, the Tasmanian government was formally advised that the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, the independent federal regulator, had approved an emergency use permit for florfenicol in Tasmanian salmon farms. Under the permit, which specifies dosage rates and administration methods, florfenicol may only be used when veterinarians determine treatment is necessary. Its use must be strictly monitored and regulated under all relevant legislation. Our government has ensured that comprehensive information on fish health, florfenicol use, regulation and monitoring is available to the public on all relevant department websites including NRE Tasmania, the Environment Protection Authority (EPA), and Public Health.

To ensure compliance, the EPA, Tasmania's independent environmental regulator, developed a new monitoring schedule for florfenicol informed by expert public health advice, and has published a real-time map showing where treatments are being administered to provide the public with timely and accurate information.

The SPEAKER - The honourable Premier's time has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr GEORGE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr GEORGE - Premier, will you undertake to get those answers to the questions I put to you and to give clear answers? Has the short-term closure come to an end? If not, when will it? What are the results from lobster flesh testing, and what risk is there and what danger is there of more rock lobster fisheries being closed as a result of antibiotic treatment?

The SPEAKER - The Premier has already undertaken to take it on notice.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, Mr George, for your question and interest in this matter. I will look at the first question and then the supplementary and seek to provide answers to you as quickly as possible. I take that on notice.


North Launceston Football Club - Minister's Comments

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for SPORT, Mr DUIGAN

[10.29 a.m.]
I will read out some more of the President of North Launceston Football Club's statement. It says:

When Minister Duigan offered a financial contribution to do due diligence with all options, I accepted it in good faith. I was firmly of the belief that we had an arrangement that did not require me to continue to reaffirm it. It was contingent only upon the Liberals being re-elected and nothing else. Any shifting of blame to suggest that myself or the club was exploring an alternative option is unconscionable. [tbc]

Minister, why are you trying to cling to a justification that the club says is flat-out wrong?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, again, I take the opportunity to apologise for comments I made during Estimates, which appear to have caused some concern -

Mr Willie - You're apologising two weeks after the fact.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr DUIGAN - I think we need to own them and I will certainly do that. As I say, these conversations were had in the context of an election campaign. Obviously election commitments are the remit of political parties, but what is very important in all of this is that I remain committed to the long-term future home for North Launceston Football Club and that's the only thing I'm focused on. I continue to be engaged with the club, I had been before the election, through the election and subsequent to the election. That is the position I will take, because this is an issue that clearly needs resolution and we are committed to that outcome.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question.

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Mr WILLIE - The North Launceston Football Club has called the minister out. Why is he trying to change his story and blame them?

The SPEAKER - Honourable minister, you might want to add further to your answer.

Mr DUIGAN - I've had meetings with the North Launceston Football Club, I've had correspondence as recently as this week saying thank you for that engagement and please wait for the outcomes of our annual general meeting to be held next week, where the membership of the club will provide its input into what it sees as the next step. At that stage, the City of Launceston, the NTFA, Stadiums Tasmania and the Tasmanian state government will all be involved in working through the next steps.


Paul Reynolds - Investigation

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

[10.32 a.m.]
In the most recent episode of podcast Badge of Betrayal, a currently serving senior officer in Tasmania Police described the review into child sexual abuser Paul Reynolds as 'a failed inquiry'. He said the Weiss review had not addressed fundamental and important matters, but made it clear that was not because of any failures of the reviewer, but because of the narrow scope and limited powers of the review.

During Adjournments over the past two days, I've detailed a range of significant questions that remain unanswered. These include questions about the actions of senior members of the Tasmanian government and Tasmania Police in response to the Reynolds matter, both before and after his death. Do you acknowledge this matter has not been satisfactorily examined and will you ensure the government acts to make sure all outstanding issues are properly investigated?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for her question and genuine interest in this matter. First, I will say again that our hearts go out to victim/survivors, particularly those of Mr Paul Reynolds. There is absolutely no place in our society for that kind of predatory behaviour against children, but particularly no place for that in Tasmania Police. 

In terms of the reviews that have been conducted into Mr Reynolds' behaviour, these have been extensive. The commission of inquiry has examined them, indeed with a specific case study, there has been a coronial investigation, the Weiss review which was commissioned subsequent to the commission of inquiry, and of course the police professional standards investigation which uncovered Paul Reynolds' offending, which was reported by a police officer at the time and subsequently Mr Reynolds took his own life.

As I mentioned before, these matters have been extensively canvassed off the back of the commission of inquiry. The Commissioner of Police apologised specifically for the decision of the former commissioner of police to grant a police funeral to Mr Reynolds. It was the wrong decision by the commissioner at the time to grant that. I've also echoed that apology on behalf of government in the past. From that, the police handbook was updated so that commissioners in future have to take into account police professional standards investigations in the granting of any police funeral, so that matter has already been resolved.

The Weiss review was extensive and widely regarded as a very strong professional body of work. It made five recommendations and the government accepted all five of those. The police commissioner also accepted all five and the rollout of the actions to implement the Weiss recommendations are well underway. They were funded in past budgets and in this Budget and Tasmania Police are doing an exceptional job to ensure we're delivering on those commitments and helping to rebuild the trust of the community and protecting victim/survivors. I think it's really heartening to see the work of the new police command for community engagement. That was part of the Weiss recommendations and they have been doing wonderful work to help bring the community together and address some of these concerns.

I think in one of your previous contributions you mentioned that the Integrity Commission hasn't been notified. That is not correct. Of course this is a public document.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - The Police minister referenced the Weiss review and the police standards review and said that these had uncovered Paul Reynolds' offending. Correct, but they did not and were not empowered to ask the questions which I've put before the House on a number of occasions about the actions or inactions of people in senior positions of power. My question remains. Minister, can you explain why you won't do the investigation? Is it because you're uncomfortable about what it might find?

The SPEAKER - The honourable member's time for the question has expired but I do draw the minister back to the original question.

Mr ELLIS - As I mentioned before, there was a police Professional Standards investigation in 2018, a coronial inquest in 2023 -

Dr Woodruff - But they didn't look at these matters; that's the point.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ELLIS - Dr Woodruff, the inquiry into the Tasmanian government's response into child sexual abuse in institutional settings looked specifically at that matter.

Dr Woodruff - It did not ask the question about the funeral.

The SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff, you can ask another question if you're not happy with the minister's answer. I ask, for the next 30 seconds, that the minister be heard, please.

Mr ELLIS - There was the Weiss review itself, and then following the Weiss review, the commissioner directed all police Professional Standards files involving allegations of sexual abuse to be proactively referred to the Integrity Commission. This matter has been extensively looked into, Dr Woodruff. The decision to grant a police funeral has already been acknowledged as wrong and the decision to make and improve processes was made ahead of the Weiss review.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The only one who has the call at the moment is the honourable Leader of the Opposition.


North Launceston Football Club - Minister's Comments

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for SPORT, Mr DUIGAN

[10.38 a.m.]
Can you point to any communication from the club that backs up the story you're now trying to run with?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question and again take this opportunity to say that the government remains a strong supporter of the North Launceston Football Club amongst all our football and sporting organisations. What is at issue here is very much the future for North Launceston and its ongoing home and continuing contribution to the sporting landscape in the north of the state. As I say, we will work with the club -

Mr WILLIE - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. My question to the minister is very specific. What communication does he have from the club to back up his version of events?

The SPEAKER - I do draw the minister back to the original question.

Mr DUIGAN - I certainly have correspondence from the club written, verbal -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr DUIGAN - I make the point, as I have previously done, that in the cut and thrust of elections, political parties make election commitments. That is their right to do so and I assume that is the same for the Greens and the Labor Party -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, interjections will cease.

Mr DUIGAN - Thank you, honourable Speaker. Again, as I say, I would apologise once again for -

Mr Willie - Answer the question; it is very specific.

The SPEAKER - Honourable Leader of the Opposition, this is your first warning.

Mr DUIGAN - my choice of words. They were clearly ordinary. 

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question the Leader has asked is very specific. What evidence do you have, communications from the club at that time said they didn't want the $100,000?

The SPEAKER - Honourable minister.

Mr DUIGAN - In my role, I've had conversations with the club prior to the election, through the course of the election, post the election - 

Ms Finlay - Saying that they didn't want the $100,000?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition, this is your third and final warning. You've already had two others today. I ask that all interjections cease. Allow the minister to be heard. There's other forms for this House. You have more questions to go. This is the last day. I ask that respect is shown for all members of the House.

Mr DUIGAN - As I say, communication prior to the election, through the course of the election, after the election. Post the annual general meeting of the North Launceston Football Club next week, I expect to have further conversations with the club as we work to find what is the most beneficial, mutually agreeable -

The SPEAKER - The honourable member's time has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A Supplementary Question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Mr WILLIE - Does the minister have the communication from the club saying that they don't want the $100,000?

The SPEAKER - Honourable minister. 

Mr DUIGAN - This is an email from Adrian Hall, who is the president of North Launceston, essentially just saying -

Mr Willie - Saying what?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order

Mr DUIGAN - To me, which obviously I've read, saying:

Thank you. I appreciate your ongoing engagement and look forward to speaking to you post our annual general meeting.

Mr WILLIE - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. He's not answering the question. 

The SPEAKER - The minister cannot be forced to come back and say any more. He's indicated that he has finished his answer. The next call goes the Honourable Dr Woodruff.

Mr Willie - It's a protection racket. 

The SPEAKER - Order, I take offence to that.

Mr Willie - I withdraw.

The SPEAKER - Thank you.


Minister for Environment - Legal Fees

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for ENVIRONMENT, Ms OGILVIE

[10.43 a.m.]
During budget Estimates, we asked you if you had been the subject of, or party to any Supreme Court matters. You gave us a straight answer, 'No.' We thank you for being clear and direct. We also asked you if the taxpayer had covered any of your legal fees. Again, you gave us a straight answer, 'Yes', you had. We hope you'll follow your own lead and give us a full answer today, too. 

Given it is public money that's being spent on your legal fees, surely you'll agree the public has a right to know the details. Can you please tell us the total amount of legal fees you had covered by the taxpayer? And can you tell us what those fees were in relation to?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. You will be aware that ministers, from time to time, are engaged in matters which are connected with their work roles. No matter how we go about our business, we are entitled to protect ourselves legally. I don't have the figure you seek.

Dr Woodruff - Would you table that?

Ms OGILVIE - Happy to have a think about giving that to you.

Dr Woodruff - Hold on. Could we take it on notice, minister? 

Ms OGILVIE - Well, I might. 

Dr Woodruff - You might? It's only public money.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Ms OGILVIE - If I'm able to finish my answer. There are matters we can't be drawn into responding to, that actually preclude us from providing some information. I'm happy to have a think about it. I won't take it on notice, but I will consider it. And I'm glad you enjoyed my performance in Estimates. 

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - The minister did a fantastic job of being evasive about public money that was spent on paying her personal legal fees. 

Ms Ogilvie - It's not personal legal fees.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Dr Woodruff has the call.

Dr WOODRUFF - That's what the question was: Can you please table the legal fees and give us information about what they were in relation to?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Minister for Environment.

Ms Ogilvie - Thank you. I'll consider your question.

Dr Woodruff - Well, that's a rubbish answer. We won't stop, you know.

Ms Ogilvie - Sorry, Dr Woodruff, I didn't quite hear what you were saying?

The SPEAKER - Order, the honourable Minister for the Environment will cease her interjections. The honourable Prof Razay is the only one who has the call right now.


Science Accessibility for Children and Young People

Prof RAZAY question to MINISTER for INNOVATION, SCIENCE and the DIGITAL ECONOMY, Ms OGILVIE

[10.45 a.m.]
Science is a powerful and necessary tool for making the world a better place. Promoting science in schools and universities to encourage children and young people to participate and become enthusiastic about science helps Tasmania remain connected with both science and the community into the future. This is especially relevant in Tasmania, where nearly half of our youth do not finish year 12 and Tasmania faces shortages of skilled labour. For example, more than $1.7 billion is needed to upgrade water and sewage infrastructure, but we're facing shortages of qualified water engineers and technicians. Can the honourable minister explain what training, initiatives and incentives are available to make science more accessible and engaging with children and young people?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I really appreciate that you've attended our events recently. Last night in the House - and thank you, Ms Finlay, for co-venturing on the TasICT event. What a magnificent event in the House, filled with engineers, scientists and educators. And it's by bringing those three elements together - state government, both with education at school level and tertiary education, our industry and community science and researchers from IMAS through to space tech. We're doing incredible things.

We know the future is digital, I say this all the time. We need people who are good at numbers and people who are good at digital. We heard last night, in particular from the university, that we have quite a long way to go getting kids into maths and science, to rebuild this part of our academic community. 

We are keen to work, particularly with the university, which we are doing, not just through the STEM centre that we spoke about last night - and I thank Labor for their support in relation to that. but right across the state. Some of the things that get kids excited about studying STEM are the ones where they can see the big picture. Some of that is around our space tech sector that we have delivered. The University of Tasmania owns an array of radio telescopes across the nation. We, as a Liberal government, have worked with the university and industry in innovation to develop businesses like Geoneon, which can measure climate change from space. It's pretty exciting stuff. They've gone global.  So, we get it, we get advanced manufacturing. This morning, we heard about SoSub, which is a wonderful group as well, doing some incredible things in aquaculture: robots that can fix nets under the water.

The initiatives we are doing are important. We need to land more of those. The STEM campus Sandy Bay retention upgrade is a pivotal piece of what we're doing in science and technology. 

I also give a shout-out to our scientific community, particularly IMAS and the work they're doing with endangered species. We're thinking about the parrots - I've held those little parrots and they're beautiful; the work we're doing with the Maugean skate and others. That science and research is amazing. We co-venture, as a state, with the federal government on this.

From the Environment portfolio, there's a lot of innovation as well. Across every single portfolio in this government, we have innovation happening. It's being driven by great people in our departments. We also have the AI explosion happening. We're seeking to harness and leverage that in a safe way that improves people's working lives by taking some drudgery out and to supercharge what we can do as a state government.


Tasracing - TasInsure Text Message

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.50 a.m.]
During the election campaign, Tasracing used government staff and resources to promote Liberal Party policy. Your Racing minister was caught red-handed misleading parliament about it yesterday. Do you think it's acceptable that Tasracing promoted Liberal Party policy? Do you think it's acceptable that a minister of the Crown, Ms Howlett, shared the communications?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, the minister immediately corrected the record, I accept that. I believe that when we're, effectively, in caretaker mode, there needs to be considerable caution when it comes to these matters. The decision, as I understand, by the CEO to promote TasInsure in the way in which it did, was his alone, as I understand that. The minister has made it very clear in detailed the events to the House last evening and has corrected the record as is acceptable.

Mr WILLIE - Point of order. Yeah, it's relevance. The question is about the Premier -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - For the clarity of the House, I cannot force a minister to stand at the lectern for as long as you want. There are other forms of the House, if you have issues with it. You can ask another question, you can raise it on Adjournment, you can do a motion. However, a minister cannot be forced to give the answers that you want. They cannot be forced to stay at the lectern, if they've finished and sat down, that is their choice. You can raise it through another question or adjournment or other form.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Honourable Speaker, the question is about the Premier and whether he thinks it's acceptable that Tasracing shared Liberal Party policy during an election, used their resources to do so and whether it's acceptable that a minister of his government, Ms Howlett, shared those communications. Premier, do you think that's acceptable?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Honourable Speaker, when it comes to what is acceptable from a GBE during an election campaign, no, and the chair of that organisation took action.

Mr Willie - And your minister?

Mr ROCKLIFF - When it comes to Ms Howlett, who again detailed on the adjournment last night and corrected the record. As members would know, I corrected the record today as soon as I was made aware that a previous Facebook post indicated I had been aware of Tasracing's social media post prior to my appearance at scrutiny committee hearings.


Minister for Environment - Legal Fees

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for ENVIRONMENT, Ms OGILVIE 

[10.53 p.m.]
What do you have to hide? Why can't you just tell us what the legal fees were for and how much it cost taxpayers?

ANSWER

Laced with tone, again. Our public officers and ministers, all of us, are involved in complex issues and undertaking duties in serving the Tasmanian community of which you're well aware. From time to time they may be the subject of legal proceedings, inquiries, claims and other actions. Despite the fact they're acting in good faith and within the scope of their duties. It's sometimes necessary to provide legal assistance and indemnity to public officers and ministers to protect the Crown's interests and the integrity and effective management of the State Service and ensure fair treatment.

The legal assistance framework is not something new. It was first put into place under the former Labor government. The decision to grant indemnity or legal advice is not taken lightly and as I've said, I'm not going to be drawn into responding to questions that seek information from which I'm precluded from providing.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - Everything the minister talked about was obviously in relation to her role at work, which is why there should be no problems with her telling Tasmanians how much is spent on the legal fees for that. Minister, why don't you just table the legal fees, the amount and what it was about?

The SPEAKER - Honourable minister. 

Ms OGILVIE - Again, I'm not going to be drawn into responding to questions that seek information from which I'm precluded from providing.

Dr Woodruff - Minister, but you're not precluded.

The SPEAKER - Order, the Leader of the Opposition, already has the call.


Ministerial Code of Conduct

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

10.54 a.m.]
We have a Code of Conduct that reflects the expectation that ministers, while in the service of the people of Tasmania, must uphold the highest standards of integrity and be honest, professional and accountable in the performance of all their duties. It applies to the Premier and each minister, and the consequences of failing to observe the code at all times is a matter for the Premier and the minister concerned. Premier, you have two ministers who clearly breached the code and you don't seem to care. Will you finally enforce your own code of conduct or should Tasmanians assume it's meaningless under your leadership?

ANSWER

I don't accept the characterisation of your question in terms of my commitment to the code. Of course, I do care, and that's why it's important that both ministers, who have been under scrutiny about various matters, corrected the record in the case of Ms Howlett's concern, and clarified and apologised in the case of Mr Duigan, who I note is working with the North Launceston Football Club to ensure that they have a home.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Premier, clearly their stories have changed. What are you doing to enforce your Code of Conduct?

The SPEAKER - Premier. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you for the question. They have clarified and apologised and corrected the record.


TasWater Infrastructure

Mr Di FALCO question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Mr PEARCE

[10.56 a.m.]
We heard extensively during scrutiny that TasWater's infrastructure is in a dire situation, leading to sewage spills that have significant impacts on the community and environment. They say significant upgrades are the only solution. Will you support their plans even when the community's cost pressures increase?

ANSWER

I recognise the questions and the input that he had during that scrutiny, particularly with Tasmanian Irrigation (TI), where I outlined some of the outstanding work that Tasmanian Irrigation have been conducting over the past 12 months and some of the projects that we have been able to deliver. Moreover, the management of water around, not only your electorate, but our state and under the auspice of the agricultural sector is important.

The member must also realise, and we all need to realise here, that TI's component of water management in Tasmania, particularly irrigation, occupies about 10 per cent, so they are a relatively small manager. There are other agencies around that and you referred to the sewerage issue and that would be a matter for another department. When it comes to the delivery of irrigation water then that is my remit and that was clearly dictated in those Estimates.

I'm happy to provide you with even more information on some of those schemes. One such scheme that we're conducting - in fact, I'm visiting next week - is the Winnaleah scheme, I'll go down to Circular Head tomorrow, it's a seven hour trip for me from here, to talk to irrigators in the Duck basin area about their issues, then we're moving down to the south-east to talk about them. So, this is going on.

When it comes to effluent it is a different department; when it comes to irrigation, I'm happy to show you and maybe even take you along with me.

Mr Abetz - Speaker, if I may quickly interpose -

The SPEAKER - On indulgence?

Mr ABETZ - Yes, on indulgence. The member for Lyons' question was about TasWater, which is in my purview, not Tasmanian Irrigation. I believe the minister may have misheard and, on that basis, with the leave of the House, I will take the question on notice from Mr Di Falco and get back to him.

Mr Di FALCO - Yes, thank you.

Mr Pearce - I simply didn't want to the throw the Treasurer under the bus.


Ministerial Standards

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.00 a.m.]
The Minister for Sport has admitted to cancelling a funding promise to North Launceston after the club stood with Labor.

Members interjecting.

Mr WILLIE - He has.

The Racing minister blatantly misled parliament yesterday and only corrected the record when she was caught. Standards used to mean something in this place, Premier, but so far you haven't had the strength or the standards to do anything about it. Will you commit to holding these ministers accountable for their actions or will the parliament have to do it for you?

Dr Woodruff - There needs to be consequences in this parliament.

The SPEAKER - Order. The Premier is the only one with the call.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. The ministers have held themselves to account over the last few days. We won't be verballed by your questions, which are a mischaracterisation of events. There's been an apology and a clarification from minister Duigan and -

Ms Haddad - They only apologised when they were caught.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Clark.

Mr ROCKLIFF - there has been a correction of the record as well, which happens.

Ms Haddad - Remember Adam Brooks, Steve Kons? There used to be consequences.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark, this is your first warning.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I know that the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday, I believe, corrected the record as well. As soon as minister Howlett was made aware, she corrected the record. That is a minister being accountable, as is minister Duigan as well.

Ms Haddad - No, only when they were called out.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark, that is your second warning. On warnings, just a reminder that they last for the whole day and there's a few members on a few. Just as a bit of encouragement, Santa's keeping a list and checking it twice and it depends if you're naughty or nice if you get one. I encourage people for the rest of today to please remember it's the last day of the year.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - The ministers and the Premier can try to change their stories and change the version of events, but they are not being held accountable. Will the Premier hold them accountable or will the parliament have to do it for you?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Look, the reality is the ministers have clarified and apologised. In terms of Mr Duigan, he has written to members of this parliament as well, clarified and apologised.

Mr Willie - The club has called him out. Unconscionable.

The SPEAKER - This is your second warning, Mr Willie.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Minister Howlett has corrected the record and apologised. We can see the game here, Mr Willie, the game is to delay. You want to disrupt the parliament when it's very clear. We have ministers who have accepted responsibility, corrected the record, clarified and apologised. What we want to do is get on with a job and we have some very important historic legislation to do today. I'm not talking about the stadium, I'm talking about ending greyhound racing in this state and leading the nation.

Time expired.


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Cancer Surgery Cancellations

Ms ROSOL question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mrs ARCHER

[11.03 a.m.]
My question is on behalf of my constituent Scott. Scott has had chemotherapy and radiation for bowel cancer; this reduced the tumour size so it could be removed. He should have had the follow-up surgery within 10 weeks of the end of radiation. It's now 13 weeks since radiation finished and Scott's surgery has been cancelled three times, twice for administrative reasons and once due to lack of staff in ICU, which he needs for post-operative care. He is stressed and worried about his next surgery date. As well as this, he was transferred from one Holman Clinic caseworker to another and has not been contacted since. He is missing the care he previously received. Scott also told me this morning he is devastated the stadium will be approved while he isn't even sure if his surgery will go ahead. Scott asks why lack of staff has been allowed to prevent his time-critical surgery and why have you prioritised a stadium over staffing to enable his essential surgery?


Education - School Holiday - Pay for Teachers

Mrs GREENE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

I ask this question on behalf of Lisa, a teacher assistant who has supported children with complex needs in public schools for over a decade. Every school holiday Lisa is stood down with no pay. She budgets dollar for dollar, she goes without, and she was relying on the pay rise that was due this December just to make ends meet. Bargaining meetings have been postponed, they've been cancelled, they've been pushed back and now she will go into Christmas and the school holidays without the pay rise that she and her colleagues so desperately need. Premier, will you commit to providing back pay to ensure Lisa and thousands of low-paid education staff are not financially punished because this government has dragged out bargaining? If not, can you explain to our public servants how you expect them to survive yet another school holiday with no income, rising household costs and a government that can't even keep to its own bargaining schedule? 


North West Regional Hospital - New Mental Health Precinct

Mr JAENSCH question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mrs ARCHER

My constituents are pleased to see that a development application for the new mental health precinct at the North West Regional Hospital in Burnie has now been submitted to the Burnie City Council. Can the minister please confirm if the new mental health precinct will cater for the needs of young people in our community requiring mental health care?


Public Sector Wage Increase 

Ms HADDAD question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

My question is on behalf of public sector workers in my electorate of Clark. Premier, not only have you and your government let down public sector workers in the current negotiations, leaving thousands of workers without their promised pay rise before Christmas, but you are also letting them down every day as you have failed to implement all of the promises you made in the 2022 wages agreement. What do you have to say to workers about this delay and disrespect and what are you going to do about it?


Port Cygnet - Reopen Historic Wooden Jetty

Mr GEORGE question to MINISTER for PARKS, Mr DUIGAN

My question is on behalf of the boaties in my electorate at Cygnet. Minister, will you intervene immediately to reopen the historic wooden jetty at Port Cygnet? This jetty is much loved, well used and greatly needed by boat owners, commercial operators and, of course, by fishers. The jetty is caught in a bureaucratic maze between MAST and Parks. Will you act to ensure that offers to repair and maintain the jetty are considered and that the jetty remains open? 


Easter Derwent Highway - Lack of Lighting

Ms BUTLER question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT 

Bridgewater and Gagebrook community members have raised the lack of lighting along the East Derwent Highway. We understand that the department is aware of the matter. Can the minister please prioritise the lighting along the East Derwent Highway? We have had a fatality there and it may have something to do with poor lighting.


Cygnet - Reopen Boat Jetty

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

My question is on behalf of Bob, Jeremy, Mark and so many other people in Cygnet.

Mr Abetz - Not Bob Brown?

Dr WOODRUFF - No. The honourable Cassy O'Connor asked a question on behalf of me about the boat jetty in Cygnet The minister said he would speak to MAST and make sure the jetty remained open. The jetty has been closed in the last couple of days and people in Cygnet and boat people are very concerned about that. Will the minister please intervene urgently so that the jetty is open before Christmas and ensure that the stand-off between MAST and Parks is resolved and the jetty remains available for public use into the future? 


Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement - Impact of Withdrawal

Mr FERGUSON question to MINISTER for BUSINESS, INDUSTRY, and RESOURCES, Mr ELLIS

My question is on behalf of the forestry workers in my electorate and their families across Bass, especially in the north-east and East Tamar. Given federal Labor's deal with the Greens to withdraw the legal status of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement, will the minister advise what the assessed impact of this betrayal will be for Tasmania? What actions can Tasmanian representatives take to have this appalling betrayal reversed?
	
	Mr Willie - On a day when you're shutting down an industry?
	
	The SPEAKER - Order.
	
	Time expired.
	
	
RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

The SPEAKER - I'd like us all to please welcome to the gallery the Parliamentary Debating Shield winners from Launceston College and the Parliamentary Debating Plate winners from Scotch Oakburn College. Welcome to parliament.

Members - Hear, hear.

PETITION

East Derwent Highway Safety Issues

[11.10 a.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) -Honourable Speaker, I have the honour to present a petition signed by approximately 230 petitioners, praying that the House will call on the Minister of State Growth to investigate and take action to ensure appropriate access and vision to motorists and pedestrians crossing the East Derwent Highway between Pace Street, Bridgewater and Lamprill Circle, Herdsman Cove.

Petition received.


SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS

Debate Motion Forthwith

[11.13 a.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I  move -

That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the following motion from being debated forthwith: Censure of Minister for Sport, a motion being made and the question being proposed that the House -

		(1)	Notes on 3 July, the North Launceston Football Club received a draft letter from the minister, indicating that they would provide $100,000 to help secure a new home for the club;

		(2)	Notes on 17 November, Mr Winter asked in Estimates why the funding was withdrawn, and Mr Duigan admitted that it was because the club had stood with Labor in the media;

		(3)	That subsequently, minister Duigan tried to justify the decision and shift blame onto the club;

		(4)	In a statement, the club president said that their arrangement with Minister Duigan was unambiguous and that it was contingent only on the Liberals being re-elected and nothing else;

		(5)	The president of the club also said, 'Any shifting of blame to suggest that myself, or the club was exploring an alternative option is unconscionable';

		(6)	Received a letter from Minister Duigan to all members two weeks after the fact, which is a signed confession only because he is concerned about consequences;

		(7)	Notes that this kind of conduct from ministers during election campaigns is a gross misuse of power and is not becoming of ministers of the Crown;

		(8)	The politicisation of community organisations and sporting clubs for political gain is an erosion of the fundamentals of how our democracy should work;

		(9)	Censures the minister over his unconscionable behaviour;

		(10)	Ensure the minister can never repeat this egregious conduct; and
		
		(11)	Calls on the government to reinstate the funding commitment to the club, as promised.

This is important and I will start with the remarks of the Premier, who is clearly now trying to run cover, saying that this is about disrupting the business of the day. I will give a commitment to the crossbench that that is not what this is about.
