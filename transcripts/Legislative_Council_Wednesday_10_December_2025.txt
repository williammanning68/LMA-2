LEAVE OF ABSENCE

Member for Pembroke - Mr Edmunds

[11.06 a.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) (by leave) - Mr President, I move - 

That the honourable member for Pembroke, Mr Edmunds, be granted leave of absence from the service of the Council for this day's sitting.

Motion agreed to.


APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 2025 (No. 63)

Third Reading

[11.07 a.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, thanks. I wish to make a brief contribution on the third reading of Appropriation Bill No. 1, particularly to note that the processes we go through - not to speak against the bill, I'm not going to vote against it - the processes we go through are pretty clearly laid out. When we have the budget wrap-up, which we've had yesterday, we provide a whole heap of information to the various departments on the items we've left open. 

We narrow our debate to those matters. What we saw yesterday and we've seen every year for just about as long as I can remember is that we've provided the questions in advance for the ones we've left open, the questions we're going to follow up on, and we see ill-prepared responses and a lack of detail that should be provided. It should be available at the Table.

It's not like we're asking these members of the departments to appear blind; we've sent them the details of the reports for which have the line items left open. We've sent them the questions that further questions are required on. One would have thought - I know the member for Mersey asked a question in his contribution that we were assured that could be provided later in the day, and yes, it was. It begs the question why wasn't it there in the first place. 

I find that disrespectful to this House. We work really hard to do our budget scrutiny and we only leave items open where there are other matters that, if we had that information at the Table during estimates, we would have prosecuted it further there. I rise to raise these matters because hopefully it will change and we will see far more respect being shown to this place through better-prepared responses to the questions that we've dutifully gone through in the Estimates process. 

I know all our committees spent many hours scrutinising the various departments. Most of them, in fairness, didn't have a lot of questions on notice; you saw the speed with which we went through the reports. We only left those items open where there were outstanding matters. It's a shame that we couldn't move through it more quickly and have the information relevant at the time. Essentially, we had to give the Leader permission, rather than recommit that section of the schedule, we enabled it to be tabled at the end of the schedule, which is not really where it should be. It should have been provided during that time. It's not a criticism of the Leader either because she's only providing information that's provided to her through that process. It's disappointing. It happens every year but this year it's obviously the end of the year and everyone thinks parliament has risen. Well, no, we're still here doing important work, but the same thing still happens before the winter break at times.

I hope that the Leader can provide these comments back to the government because in six months or thereabouts, we will be doing it again. I won't oppose the bill, but I wanted to make those points because it is very disappointing.

[11.10 a.m.]
Mr DUIGAN (Windermere - Minister for Energy and Renewables) - Mr President, in relation to the comments, certainly from my experience in what was provided yesterday, there were clear answers to the questions on notice, but obviously then there is the opportunity to deviate to some extent from the actual question that was presented on notice. It is very difficult for departments to foreshadow exactly where members might take their level of questioning.

I don't think it is fair or reasonable to say there's a lack of respect. It is virtually impossible to foreshadow issues that might come forward and obviously we would prefer to have the information there, but that's not always the case.

SUSPENSION OF SITTING

[11.14 a.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move -

That the sitting be suspended until the ringing of the division bells.

This is for the purpose of the continuation of briefings related to the Greyhound Racing Legislation Amendments (Phasing Out Reform) Bill 2025.

Sitting suspended from 11.14 a.m. to xx.xx p.m.


MOTION

Referral of Greyhound Racing Legislation Amendments (Phasing Out Reform)Bill 2025 to Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Rading Transition

[12.44 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) (by leave) - Mr President, I move -

That the Greyhound Racing Legislation Amendments (Phasing Out Reform) Bill 2025 be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition for consideration and report.

In speaking to that motion and moving that motion that effectively refers the legislation that we are set to deal with today to the Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition, in my view, this referral should have occurred when the legislation was first drafted and not in the dying days of the parliamentary year.

The committee's terms of reference clearly anticipate, as I was informed in a phone call with Mr Carroll that this is the principal and what he expected to be the only piece of legislation required to give effect to the government's policy to ban greyhound racing in 2029. This is the legislation that does it. In my view it clearly fits in the remit of that committee that was established with one of their terms of reference to look at this question

I acknowledge the genuine animal welfare concerns that underpin the policy intent of this legislation. These concerns are important and deserve to be taken seriously. Personally, I'm not a fan of the racing industry; it holds no attraction for me. But I am a strong supporter of proper process, transparency and treating people, particularly smaller and minority groups, with respect when making decisions that directly and profoundly impact their lives and livelihoods.

On that measure the process surrounding this bill has been nothing short of appalling. On 17 July 2025, during the state election campaign, the Premier wrote to the greyhound racing industry, outlining his party's full support. Participants had 100 years of bipartisan political support and three weeks after the election they were told the industry would be shut down by a phone call from the minister's office, literally hours before the policy announcement was made. There was no consultation, no communication other than that very late phone call and, in my view, no respect. That is not how we should treat Tasmanians, regardless of our personal view about their industry.

Following that decision, the parliament agreed to establish the Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition with clear and comprehensive terms of reference. The committee was given significant powers, as all committees are, to send for papers and persons and sit during any adjournment of either House and to adjourn from place to place as necessary to collect the evidence that they would require to assist in that transition. 

The committee's terms of reference specifically identify legislative requirements for the transition as part of its role, yet this bill, in any form, draft or otherwise, was never referred to the committee before it received its first and second reading and passage through the other place.

This legislation does impact on people who have had no real opportunity, in my view, to have their say. You might argue that they were offered opportunities and said no. I mean this has been a very rapidly moving process for those people who are feeling completely disrespected and disenfranchised by a complete turnaround and what they thought was strong support to be anything but. Of course they were hurting. I have heard from people from my community that they wanted to be involved in the legislation; they weren't aware that this was the process to do it. 

You can criticise all you like and say the industry bodies know that, but with all due respect to some of these people - I know some of them are probably listening - that they aren't the most highly educated people. They're not a bunch of lawyers and doctors and other really informed people who understand parliamentary process by and large. There are some who probably can and do, but I think we need to be sure that they were given ample opportunity to understand what the process was. 

I met with some in my office and encouraged them to be involved. I said, 'If you don't, you risk cutting off your nose to spite your face. I know you don't support the approach being taken by the government or the ban, at all, but when you're dealing with matters to give effect to this, like the legislation, you do need to be involved and at the table.' 

I can understand how difficult that would have been for them. It's like presiding over your own funeral - not an ideal place to be put. 

I do hear the criticisms that they chose not to engage initially, particularly with the working group that was set up that through the Racing Integrity Commission to oversee this. I don't think, even when I tried to explain, there was a full understanding that if you really want a say in the legislation and in the transition, even if you completely disagree, which they do, that you need to insert yourself into it. It's not a criticism of those individuals, it was just that they were in a terribly distressed state and it was difficult for them to understand how they can and should participate.

That aside, in any event, a proper committee process with a committee that was set up for the purpose to enable all stakeholders, not just those in the industry itself, but those in the animal welfare space and others, to enable them to get support to prepare considered submissions on the bill would have taken some time for them. Usually, we have a period of consultation on draft legislation for stakeholders who are directly impacted or have an interest in the area to have an opportunity to prepare a submission - that's to a draft bill.

The committee would enable that process. That would allow time to put out a call for submissions to hear from the relevant stakeholders - as all committees do. The committee receives those submissions, considers them and weighs up the evidence, and reports, according to it.
Over the years we've had other bills referred to committees in this place, either the whole bill or parts of the bill. The most recent one being the expungement matter that was referred to the Gender and Equality Committee, and that wasn't the whole bill; it was a specific component of the bill. However, it did deal with a very small number of people, probably 10 men, whereas this deals was with quite a larger number - not half the population certainly - in terms of what it means for them moving forward.

Even preparing a submission, particularly appearing before a committee, can be quite daunting for many people, and we do need to keep that in mind. They might have preferred, and I don't know because it was never tested, to have some support to prepare a submission on provisions in the bill where they saw there could be problems with it - or other ways of achieving it or in consequences that may not have been considered. I don't know whether that's the case or not because there was not an opportunity to go through that process.

I do acknowledge that the industry was invited to join, as the Leader by interjection suggested, the Racing Integrity Commissioner's committee or working group, and they understandably declined to participate. Even if they had participated, that committee, as I understand it, was not given a copy of the draft bill for comment, either. That's in my conversations.

It just seems that this has been very rushed, and there hasn't been an opportunity to fully consider the bill. Yes, we can do it in our House and through the Committee stage here, but it's a bit hard to get feedback on some of the provisions from those most impacted.

I understand that the industry accepted an invitation to meet with the commissioner about the bill on the morning of 6 November, but less than two hours later the bill was tabled before any feedback could be offered.

I've heard from representatives of the industry that they didn't feel that was a respectful process. It was really a briefing, not an opportunity to meaningfully engage and certainly no time to prepare suggested amendments, not being familiar with the process, particularly some of them.

When we're considering this motion to refer this bill to a committee set up for the purpose, I asked members to try to think if they don't wish to support that, to identify another example of any time where a major reform - and it is a major reform for the people who are impacted by this - has proceeded without this sort of public consultation or engagement with the impact of parties before it was tabled.

Greyhound racing participants are overwhelmingly not well versed in political processes and with all due respect, as I said, it's not an area they do engage in on a regular basis.

Whatever our views of the industry, these are real people, and they have real investments and real lives that will be fundamentally altered, and they deserve to have their voices heard. Many have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in their dogs, their equipment and their premises on the basis of this bipartisan support for many years - and on the basis that it was reconfirmed only just before the election.

But I go back to the point, regardless of the view of the industry, this is not the way we should approach major reform, no matter how welcome or supported, if we haven't taken time to engage with those directly impacted.

What was the rush? The arguments that have been advanced include, first, that greyhound owners in other jurisdictions have destroyed their animals and need legislative protections but, as I understand it, the participants in the industry are already forbidden from euthanising dogs without permission from Tasracing and its chief vet under the greyhound rules of racing. They cannot euthanise a greyhound without reason. There's a penalty of up to 200 penalty units for that.

Second, we've also heard a claim of large numbers of impregnated bitches and greyhounds being brought in from the mainland, and that will add to the cost of rehoming many more dogs. Now, I'm pretty well versed with the breeding of humans and cows. I'm not so well versed in the breeding of greyhounds, but I have done a bit of research while I could, and it seems they only have one, or two litters, at most a year. They only come in season once, possibly twice a year. There are very strict rules on how many litters they can have, what age they are, when they can have them - I can't remember the exact date, but how old they have to be and they can't breed beyond, I think, it's about six years from memory. Something like that.

In any event, there are pretty strict rules on that, and to suggest that we might see the use of stimulants to bring them back into season early, when I did a bit of research on that on veterinary sites, there are a number of side effects and risks associated with that. I don't think that would be something that most breeders would choose to do. In fact, it's often used to delay coming into season so those female dogs can race. We need to be careful about making claims about large numbers of impregnated bitches in Tasmania because this is the time, as I understand, when often they do come into season, like a lot of animals around springtime. Anyway, that's my research, and I have had some of that confirmed by the minister's adviser in how the breeding is actually managed. 

The other thing is the concern that the planning for the transition cannot continue until this bill is passed, but I find that a little bit nonsensical. This wasn't made in the briefing today; this was in a phone call I had yesterday, because I was informed this work is actually going on. Obviously, when we deal with any legislation, like the Commission for Children and Young People one that we dealt with for the third reading this morning, even though that legislation didn't pass this House for a period, there was so much work that's gone on in the background to prepare for what the department hopes is a passage of that bill to give effect to that. We all know that work doesn't go on to support what's required in any legislation in the expectation that the bill won't be passed; it just doesn't happen.

I understand there has been a lot of work done and that will continue, regardless. If this was referred to that committee, the committee could consider it and report back by March when we come back. It doesn't have to be a massive - you're looking at the legislation, you're not looking at the whole transition; you're not looking at the policy position; it's the piece of legislation. If members wanted to amend the motion to say it had to report back within a number of sitting days, you could. That's how it works in the Gender and Equality Committee. We had a limited number of sitting days, a short number. That certainly made us get on with it and we did.

The policy intent is clear: to stop greyhound racing by 30 June 2029 and that is over four years away and so I don't see -

The Council suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.


QUESTIONS

South Arm Highway Crossing Guard - State Growth Restrictions

Ms LOVELL question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[2.30 p.m.]
Ms LOVELL - Stephen is the crossing guard on South Arm Highway near Bayview Secondary College and operates as the school crossing guard there. Stephen is really well known in the community for his wigs, hats and other props and, more importantly, his engagement with students and with passing traffic. As someone with an office nearby as the local member, I can see how loved and appreciated Stephen is, and he has even won community awards for his work there.

Stephen has been told by State Growth that he is no longer allowed to wear any costumes or use any props or interact with traffic in any way other than by using his stop sign to stop traffic. The local community is outraged. I understand the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport is not present today, but as Minister for Education, do you support this decision and will you intervene so that Stephen can keep supporting students at Bayview Secondary College, Clarendon Vale Primary School and Rokeby Primary School?

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the honourable member for the question. Thank you for acknowledging that this is a decision that doesn't sit with the department for which I'm responsible, being State Growth. But when I did hear about this particular circumstance - and I was cc'd into some correspondence about this that arrived in my office today - I did reach out to the minister for Transport's office and asked for some details. I also asked for some consideration to be given about the benefits of a child and family arriving at school in a joyful manner, being greeted that way, and then when they leave school at the end of the day.

Obviously, all safety measures must be put in place - the wearing of high-vis and those types of things which I think we would all accept could not be compromised on. The minister's office and the department will look into this.

I express my thanks to our amazing crossing guards, who'd be setting up right now for 3 o'clock, for the work that they do keeping our children and our families safe, and even more so for the kindness that they show and the joy they potentially spread when a child is arriving at school or leaving school.


Public Health Advice Regarding Use of Florfenicol

Ms LOVELL question to LEADER for the GOVERMENT in the LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Ms RATTRAY

[2.33 p.m.]
Has the Director of Public Health, the Minister for Health or any other person from the government contacted any member of the parliament to request that they stop misrepresenting public health advice regarding the use of florfenicol and, if so, can you table any correspondence?

ANSWER

Mr President, the minister advises that neither the Director of Public Health nor any other person from the Department of Health or Public Health Services has had any contact with any member of parliament to request that they stop misrepresenting public health advice regarding the use of florfenicol. The minister has not written to any MP or had any contact on this matter. Members of parliament attended a cross-agency briefing on Friday 15 August at 9:00 a.m., and I do have a list of those attendees. I will table that list when I complete this answer. Ongoing advice provided by the Director of Public Health has been made publicly available on the Department of Health website, which is www.health.tas.gov.au/advice-recreational-fishing and updated regularly with links to public health also provided on both the Environment Protection Authority Tasmania website and Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania website.

Mr President, I seek leave to table a document and have it incorporated into Hansard.

Leave granted; document tabled.

See Appendix 1 (page xx).


Enquiry into Details Regarding JCP Youth and Meeting with DECYP

Ms WEBB question to MINISTER for CHILDREN and YOUTH, Ms PALMER referred to LEADER for the GOVERMENT in the LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Ms RATTRAY

[2.36 p.m.]
Regarding an ABC report on 20 November this year stating that, following concerns raised over the social media images of balaclava-clad male adults during a 'blackout program' run by JCP Youth, the education department has met with that organisation. Can the government:

confirm when that meeting occurred and who attended on behalf of the department; 

detail what was discussed, including any information requested by the department regarding both the specific incident depicted in those now-removed social media images and also the broader blackout program more generally;

detail any information provided by JCP Youth at the meeting or which the organisation may have undertaken to provide at a later date; and

clarify whether any changes will be implemented regarding JCP Youth's approach to program delivery, such as having more proactive departmental oversight and reporting?

ANSWER

Mr President, I think you might've already noticed, the Minister for Children and Young People is losing her voice, so I thank the member for allowing me to answer in her place and I will use the words just as set out. The answer to:

I am advised a meeting occurred between the Department for Education, Children and Young People and JCP Youth on 11 November 2025. At this meeting, the department was represented by the following senior staff members, Secretary of Department of Education, Children and Young People, Deputy Secretary of Child Safety and Youth Justice Operations and the Director of the Office of the Secretary.
I'm advised the department raised current issues with public commentary relating to the JCP Youth Blackout Challenge and responses to the JCP Youth social media posts. The department reiterated its expectations of JCP Youth relating to consent, data management and privacy and social media and how these matters relate to the funding agreement and relevant legislative requirements to ensure safety and wellbeing of department-referred BEAST program participants. The department requested it be informed in advance of the next scheduled blackout challenge, so that the department's attendance could be considered.

I'm advised JCP Youth provided the following information during the meeting on 11 November 2025. It confirmed that the social media images in question were removed promptly, outlined the purpose and delivery model of the blackout challenge and shared the JCP Youth plan and approach to social media in future. JCP Youth representatives indicated there are no future blackout challenges currently scheduled. The department continues to meet with JCP Youth according to the funding agreement. This includes monthly operational governance meetings and quarterly contract management reviews.

I'm advised at this time no formal changes to the JCP's Youth BEAST program delivery model have been requested by the department. Under the funding agreement, the following are required in relation to oversight and reporting: annual financial accountability reporting, annual service delivery reporting, quarterly service delivery reporting and monthly operational governance meeting participation. The Director of Strategic Commissioning and Partnerships holds responsibility for reviewing the reports and monitoring compliance according to the funding agreement. I'm also advised JCP Youth and the department meet monthly through a dedicated operational governance group to discuss operational matters and risks relating to department referred participants. The operational governance group also includes the JCP Youth CEO. The quarterly performance reports provided by JCP Youth under the funding agreement are additionally reviewed by the JCP operational governance group. I'm advised JCP Youth quarterly reports are also provided to the department's Deputy Secretary, Child Safety and Youth Justice Operations, and the Secretary of the Department for Education, Children and Young People.

It is my expectation, and obviously the ministers, that the department and JCP Youth strictly adhere to the reporting and compliance requirements under the funding agreement.


Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra MOU

Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER referred to LEADER for the GOVERMENT in the LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Ms RATTRAY

[2.41 p.m.]
I have a question on notice that I know the Leader has an answer to, but just before that, my question is to the Minister for Education.

Ms Rattray - I could take it on notice if that's of any assistance.

Ms O'CONNOR - Thank you, that's fine. Yesterday, in response to my question about the assessment level of MDT dust at Huonville High School, which has been found to be dangerous to staff and students, the minister said that she would get back to us after contacting her department with an update. It'd be great to have an update, if possible, at any time today. I will leave that there.

My question without notice to the Leader for the Government is, can the minister please release the MOU that's been signed between the government, the Department of State Growth, and the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra?

ANSWER

Mr President, thank you. The agreement is currently being finalised between the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, Stadiums Tasmania and the Macquarie Point Development Corporation. Given that it is a draft agreement between those parties, it is not a document that can be released unilaterally by the minister. However, the government will seek the consent of the TSO to release the agreement once finalised.

The government has also been clear about minimum consultation requirements in the State Policies and Projects order, noting the Federation Concert Hall is owned by the Hotel Grand Chancellor. The hotel will also be engaged in relation to improvements to the building and, when relevant, to the stage of works.


Subject

Ms WEBB question to MINISTER for CHILDREN and YOUTH, Ms PALMER referred to LEADER for the GOVERMENT in the LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Ms RATTRAY

[2.44 p.m.]
I have another question for the Minister for Children and Youth, but I believe the Leader will have the answer for me. This is regarding statements by emeritus distinguished professor Rob White reported in an ABC report on 20 November this year. That report was titled 'Department meets with JCP Youth over social media posts showing camp workers in balaclavas'[checked] in which Professor White states, and I quote:

I have to say, when I look at those images there's nothing in those images that is trauma-informed or trauma-responsive. (OK)

And quote:

In fact, it is completely the opposite of everything that we're trying to do in the area of juvenile justice and rehabilitation and restorative justice. (OK)

Can the government 

advise whether the department has requested and obtained any peer-reviewed therapeutic or trauma-informed responsive accreditation of any JCP youth programs including the BEAST program or the opt-in blackout program?

advise whether the department has requested and obtained any accredited therapeutic or trauma-responsive qualifications of any former or current JCP youth staff members?

ANSWER

Mr President, In answer to question:

Under the funding agreement between the Department for Education, Children and Young People and JCP Youth, the minister advised its service must be guided by the following COI recommendations: the Youth Justice Blueprint of 2024-2034, the Youth Justice Diversionary Framework and the Youth Justice Model of Care. The principles of the model of care in particular outline a trauma-informed and therapeutic strengths-based practice to support at-risk and offending children and young people from interactions with the youth justice system. The Director of Strategic Commissioning and Partnerships holds responsibility for monitoring compliance according to the funding agreement. The minister has also advised the department also monitors delivery of JCP Youth contracted services through dedicated monthly operational governance meetings and standardised quarterly reporting.

It is also my expectation - the minister's expectation - that the independent evaluation of the JCP Youth BEAST Program will include assessment against the government's Youth Justice Reform Strategy and COI recommendations. The minister will be seeking regular updates.

The minister has also advised JCP Youth staff undergo a five-week initial induction which includes how to work with young people in a trauma-informed way delivered through Lifeline. JCP Youth staff also undergo ongoing training once a month, including the application of the Child and Youth Safe Standards and how to keep children safe.


MOTION

Referral of Greyhound Racing Legislation Amendments (Phasing Out Reform)Bill 2025 to Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Rading Transition

Resumed from above (page xx).

[2.47 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Before the break, I was talking about the policy intent of the government with regard to the greyhound racing industry, which is to ban or stop it by 30 June 2029, which is more than four years away. For me - and from the information I've heard and had the opportunity to hear from a range of people, including the Racing Integrity Commissioner - to me there's no compelling argument why this legislation must be dealt with this week, rather than being subject to more full and proper scrutiny where those directly impacted have a chance to participate in that process. 

For these reasons I seek members' support for the referral of this bill to the Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition to do the job this parliament gave it. The committee should and could call for public submissions in response to the bill. This would allow all interested parties on all sides - animal welfare advocates, industry participants, regional communities, and others - to raise issues, concerns, and opportunities for improvements in the bill if needed. 

It's not a policy debate that we're suggesting. It's a proper scrutiny of the legislation that gives effect to that policy. I note, for example, there is no provision in the bill for compensation for industry participants who may rely on this for their income, and even if that may be a small number, I ask, is it the government's intention not to provide any support to these people?

I'm also told that part of the transition program and consideration that the Racing Integrity Commissioner has to do is to look at that. I go back to the expungement of historic offences legislation, and when that first came in - I can't remember what year it was - it was when Matthew Groom was the Attorney-General, and I had spent hours negotiating with him on the original bill to try to get compensation in the act. I got a few things I was after, but that was not one of them. I came back at least once between the last iteration and the first iteration trying to get the compensation again. But no, the next iteration that we've just dealt with came without compensation and through the work of the Greens in the lower House, they put forward a process to establish compensation - then the Gender and Equality Committee looked at that - as a committee set up for these sorts of purposes - and came back with a recommendation for compensation. 

You're not going to provide compensation or, in this case, redress, to industry participants or people impacted if you don't have a legislative mechanism for it. I was concerned when I was informed this is the legislation to guide this process and this is it. That may or may not be the case - I don't know - it may become apparent there needs to be further legislative change, but if it's not there, it means it won't happen. I don't have a view on whether it should or it shouldn't at this point. We just haven't had the information.

To the role of the committee will be to work through this bill's provisions, hear from those affected, examine the economic and financial implications, and provide this House with the informed analysis that we need. This referral would replace the consultation process that should have been undertaken by NRE when it was drafting the bill. It was interesting to hear in the briefing that NRE gave instruction to the Racing Integrity Commissioner to provide the drafting instructions. It's a bit of an unusual way to do it in many respects.

In any event, even when the draft bill landed, it was not referred to this committee that was set up for that purpose under its agreed terms of reference that went through both Houses of parliament. I believe it would allow our House to make more evidence-based decisions rather than rushed ones.

I acknowledge again the animal welfare concerns that motivate this legislation and any potential delay. These concerns matter, but so does proper process, so does respect, and so does treating people with dignity when their lives and livelihoods are being directly impacted. 

We cannot write to an industry in July - or we can, we obviously have - but we should not write to an industry in July assuring them of our of support and then shut them down three weeks later without consultation and expect that to be considered acceptable governance. You cannot or should not draft legislation affecting many people without actively enabling their input. 

You need to remember that sometimes you need to take a much more considered approach to enabling input when you're dealing with people who don't fully understand how it works. We do make special provisions for vulnerable communities. I'm not suggesting this is a particularly vulnerable community, but I'm talking in broad terms. If we're trying to get evidence or input into a committee process from a vulnerable community, you would make a provision for that, you would enable that, because that is the right thing to do. 

We should not bypass this committee process that parliament specifically established to oversee the transition and to consider legislation to give effect to the transition. The government should not seek to rush through major reform in the final sitting week of parliament without proper scrutiny, but that's what we seem to be trying to do here, or what the government seems to want to do. 

The greyhound racing industry participants will be affected. The organisations responsible for rehoming animals and the broader Tasmanian community all deserve better than that. They deserve legislation that's been developed with consultation and passed with the oversight of the committee that was set up for the purpose.
This parliament has agreed to that process through supporting that committee and it's a shame that we got to this point. It all started with the Premier's commitment that meant nothing at the end of the day. It's all about retaining power.

At least we can assure a proper process around the passage of this legislation. To be absolutely clear, I'm not asking members to support or oppose the policy intent of this bill. I'm seeking members' support to respect our proper process, to respect the people affected and to do our jobs as we're expected to. I'm seeking support of members to refer the bill to the Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition to enable that scrutiny and to enable directly impacted parties to be heard, and for the committee to fulfil its mandate. 

This work can be done before we return to parliament in mid-March, and then this House can make an informed decision based on evidence that has been informed by those directly impacted and not one made in haste without that input. 

I look forward to other members' contributions. I hope that this sees the favour of the House.

[2.54 p.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR - Mr. President, at one level, I understand the reasoning behind this motion. This has been a sudden policy reversal on the part of government, and the reasons for that are plain to us all.

However, it's still a disappointing move by the member for Murchison because, as we know, it is fraught with risk, which was made clear to us in this morning's briefings. The member asked us when a major reform went through this place without community consultation; well, I point the Council to the 157-page stadium order which was tabled on 4 November, completely absent of community consultation.

The Greyhound Racing Legislation Amendments (Phasing Out Reform) Bill was tabled two days later and it is certainly not 157 pages. Enough members felt comfortable with the stadium order to wave it through, despite the fact it wasn't the result of a question ever being asked of the Tasmanian people or the community I represent in Hobart. The Greens' concern is that delaying the bill plays right into the industry's hands at the expense of dogs and in defiance of clear public sentiment. Delay and then a complete derailment of this reform is the industry's goal.

I take honourable members who may not have had an opportunity to listen to it, to The Greyhound Girl podcast, which is an industry podcast. There was a conversation on that podcast between Luke Gatehouse, the man from Queensland brought in by the industry to advocate for them, and former Labor leader and member for Franklin, Dean Winter, and I read into the Hansard some of what the industry's objective is here. This is part of the reason that, of course, the Greens in this place will not be supporting the motion to delay. He says:[tbc]

We are not running an exercise in education at this point in time, that's a longer-term strategy that should have been happening for years. Those who don't like us have that narrative out there and we're not going to win that battle overnight. Our major battle is the decision-makers at the moment. Anyone who's listening in Tassie or around Australia, find out who your local upper House representative is - or I think they are called the Legislative Council down there - 

I mean, such is his local knowledge, he wasn't so sure. I go back to the quote:

There's 15 of them and, at the moment, there's probably about five who vote for this legislation to go through. You need eight votes to get through and we don't want another three to vote for it to get through. We want it to be either stopped or referred for some, err, wider scrutiny, would be a polite term to put it.

He goes on to call us opportunists when, really, he well knows that our consistent advocacy for animals is a matter of public record, and he says:

What I've been saying to our committee, we are in a strategic fight here that's got an end date of 2029. If they brought it forward like they did in New Zealand, the fight would be harder, but what we've got is a little bit of time up our sleeve because what it's going to be is a long battle.

And then he goes:

We don't want to get into the welfare debate because we're playing right into their narrative, because they've got all their little catchphrases and their clips they roll out from wherever they get them from. Our issue is that we have an industry that's highly regulated, we've been going through ongoing reforms since 2016 across the country and it's not a matter of the welfare of greyhounds because that is a given, because that is the number one factor that our decisions are based on.

Well, I will pause for a moment here to say the data brings that bold claim into disrepute; and from Mr Winter, he starts with:

That's the message I wanna get to. Look, next week is likely going to be a vote and I'm very hopeful that we've done the work over the past few weeks, not that we've had a lot of time, to at least stop the bill from progressing, at least pressing pause on it. It would be an amazing night next Thursday at the Hobart 1000, having knocked the bill off, knocked the laws off, get a win and then go in and watch some greyhound racing and celebrate with the rest of the group, but I think the most likely thing is that - well, the best outcome, probably, is going to be just to get it paused and, if that's the case, it's going to be a long fight ahead of us over the next few months as we make sure all the facts come out.

Well, the facts of this industry's toll on greyhounds are a matter of public record: They are embedded in the Tasracing annual report, they were put before the 2015 joint select inquiry into the industry. The facts are very well known. The Racing Integrity Commissioner, the statutory officer we have tasked with oversighting the racing codes, has asked us not to delay the bill and he's outlined the risks. The things that he told us were not claims, as has been suggested today; he presented us with data, with facts about an increase in breeding ahead of 1 January, an increase by 86 dogs imported to the island since the Premier's announcement, and we're seeing in Tasracing's annual report an increase in euthanasia, which is a euphemism for killing dogs before their time is up.

I note the commissioner offered all members of both Houses briefings following the government's announcement and I'm advised by him that very few, with the exception of the Greens and a handful of independents, took up his offer. If honourable members had taken that opportunity to hear from the commissioner before this point at any time after the bill was tabled more than a month ago, they could have put those questions to him about whether compensation is part of the government's consideration. It is our very clear understanding that compensation, a just transition for industry participants, is a necessary part of this reform. The Greens acknowledge that.

We acknowledge that there are people in the industry who've been in this industry for a very long time. It represents their livelihood. There are other people in the industry who don't make much money out of it, but they love being part of it. We acknowledge that. We acknowledge that this is causing pain and that's why we accept that there will need to be a just transition and compensation for industry participants. It's the right thing to do and I understand that the government understands that very clearly.

For the detail, this bill is very interesting. It provides an architecture for reform. It also empowers the Racing Integrity Commissioner to develop the transition plan and that transition plan would include a just compensation package. It would also make sure that we're looking after the dogs that are caught up in the industry now. 

The commissioner outlined to the joint select committee - which I'm a part of, and the Deputy Chair - in the briefing today, the extensive efforts he made at consultation, personal contact with industry representatives, offers to talk, invitations to join the roundtable and an open letter in all three Tasmanian papers to the industry, to animal lovers, to the broader Tasmanian community, to feed in to his development of the transition plan and to feed in to the process of this reform, which we know has high and strong community support.

Greyhounds Tasmania, a recently established, unaffiliated body with its head from Queensland's notoriously deadly greyhound racing industry, presumed to speak on behalf of all industry participants and refused to participate in any consultation with the commissioner. Greyhounds Tasmania reiterated this message to the joint select committee, and I will just pause for a moment here to say the joint select committee has examined the bill. We have invited the commissioner in, a number of industry participants, the RSPCA and the Dogs' Home. We have heard plenty of evidence, and - sorry?

Ms Webb - And the department.

Ms O'CONNOR - Thank you, honourable member for Nelson, and of course we had the department come in and speak to us on the record as well. We went into some detail on this bill. We asked industry participants if they would feed in, in any way, to this bill and its passage through, and they won't. I get that, at a human level, because to the industry that would be putting up the white flag. But if we delay this bill, what kind of meaningful consultation will change anything in the broader Tasmanian greyhound racing industry's view? No amount of consultation will change the industry's position.

The industry, as has been made clear in that podcast, wants to kill off this bill. It wants to keep exploiting dogs at public expense in Tasmania, and they know that if greyhound racing ends here because of the shift in public sentiment, it will be like a domino effect around the country, and that's why they're terrified. That's why they've unleashed the CEO from Queensland on us. That's why Greyhounds Australasia is suddenly interested in Tasmania - because they don't want this bill to pass and delaying the bill gives them the opportunity to make that happen. The industry and Labor are pushing hard for just this result, a delay.

I encourage members to be very careful about ignoring the advice of the statutory officer and the RSPCA and listening instead to the voice of shameless self-interest, articulated as it has been to us by Luke Gatehouse. What will delay achieve? More time for the industry, led by this figure from Queensland and on behalf of the national greyhound racing and gambling industries and the big online gambling industries, to lobby MLCs, to lobby us. I'm sure they won't be lobbying the Greens, but I'm sure they will put a lot of effort, should this be delayed, into lobbying people they think they can sway into propping up this dying unpopular industry. Greyhounds Tasmania is not a representative body, and members should note that.

Delay will lead to more dogs being born. That's what the commissioner told us. It wasn't a claim, it's a fact. On his data, there are 200 pups in the making so far or thereabouts and, according to the commissioner, more are likely to be bred in coming months. Delay will lead inevitably to more dead and injured dogs. The numbers of dogs in the industry went from a bit over 850 at the time of the Premier's announcement to 1036 after the commissioner's audit of registered, to as many as 1500 dogs we heard today, caught in the industry by next March. Potentially more, given the commissioner's concerns about greyhounds currently on unlicensed premises out of any site or mind. That's more than 1500 dogs that will need rehoming if this bill passes - most of whom will live shorter, sadder lives if it does not.

The intractable problem with this industry is its business model. It has to keep pushing out new product. That's the bottom line: fragile, gentle dogs. Dogs that are fine boned, fast, that reach speeds of up to 70 kilometres an hour on the track, which is why, of course, when there's an accident on the track, it's too often catastrophic for the animals. According to the record of injuries, shattered limbs, broken backs and ruptured necks are inevitable.

Those dogs, which are spat out the other side of this business model, are very difficult to rehome. It is hard to rehome big dogs, but, as we heard from the RSPCA CEO Andrea Dawkins today, not impossible, and they are up to the task if we give it to them through this bill. Of course, that task will be so much harder should the bill be delayed because there'll be more dogs that need to be rehomed and that's a fact. The statutory officers told us that, the data confirms it. His audit confirms it.

There is no solution to the industry's business model. It breeds these dogs as commodities to make profit and then it discards them. It's simply what it is. It requires ramming new product into the front of the pipeline, racing them hard until they run out of puff and cost more to feed than they earn. Then this enormous bulge of leftover dogs out the other end of that pipeline. Leftover sentient, gentle, beautiful dogs.

The industry just can't deal with the massive amount of its industrial waste. Rehoming organisations and animal lovers who are taking these gentle creatures in are left to clean up the mess. It's not the industry that cleans up its industrial waste. It's taxpayers, it's rehoming organisations and its people who will adopt a greyhound, which is a pretty big job. When they've been through a rehoming program, quite a few of them are still scared, stressed, under socialised, don't like men and can't handle big social situations. They often have health problems that require ongoing veterinary treatment. Adopting a greyhound is a very costly proposition.

Yesterday, in NSW the long-awaited release of the Drake report into the industry, we heard the NSW industry's answer to its industrial waste is to put these beautiful animals into crates, onto planes to the United States, and they're dying on the way.

It doesn't take much of a stretch of empathy to consider what it must be like for those dogs; used up by the industry, most of their life in a cage - and it's true, most of their life in a cage - and then put into a crate for a 24-hour flight across the Pacific Ocean to America, and they're dying on the way. This is the industry's big dirty industrial waste issue and it's one that they can't and will never resolve. It is just ethically wrong.

There's also a risk, as we know - despite the law, despite the rules of racing - that some industry participants will take matters into their own hands. As Tasracing's annual report shows, there's been an uplift in euthanasia; and this uplift in euthanasia was confirmed by the Racing Integrity Commissioner.

There's a bit of chatter here on the wonderful Rosie Saville's Facebook page. A number of members in this place will know and admire Rosie and her tenacious advocacy for these dogs. She acknowledges building a village of strong, passionate campaigners who have worked together side-by-side in solidarity to deliver this reform. When we're talking about the mental health of people who are caught up in this issue, we cannot forget the mental health of animal welfare advocates and campaigners and volunteers who work in shelters, who are seeing the byproduct of this industry come into the shelters on an almost daily basis. Their mental health is also being impacted.

Anyway, some fellow who seems to know the industry quite well gets on and says, 'Rosie Saville, you better check to see how many dog graves were found when there was a hint of racing bans. Plus, you're talking thousands in Australia, more than what you're seeing now. Check how many dogs are currently racing now and tell me as if they're all going to be adopted.' It's not a bad question. If we delay this bill and if we don't pass this bill, we are going to be dealing with hundreds more dogs that will require rehoming.

We've also seen some very unfortunate abuse and threats, and I think misogynistic language, directed towards the Minister for Racing, who's simply doing her job. It's not Ms Howlett's fault there was a change of policy. She has had to carry this, and she's had to cop the slings and arrows that have come from an industry that was made a promise in July. We can acknowledge that; but also, the the people who are occupying the government's benches now came back in well short of a majority. They needed to make some compromises in order to persuade the crossbench that they were open to new ways of working.

Ms Howlett has handled this with dignity and grace; and for that, she's copped some of the most vile, misogynistic, threatening language. It hasn't been helped by some of the language coming out of some of our colleagues in the other place.

I want to briefly go to the Tasracing annual report to again explain why delay is problematic. If you go to the tables on page 16, you're seeing that on-track euthanasia, as of the end of 2024-25, there were two dogs euthanised on track. We're seeing that in the greyhound retirement





Ms O'CONNOR - (cont) - in the greyhound retirement data that there have been 41 dogs euthanised. In 2022-23, there were 17 euthanised. We had some excuses made about a small number of dogs this morning and why they might have been put to death early, but it does not explain 41 dogs on retirement being euthanised out of this industry. It's a fact that these dogs live shorter lives than other dogs. 

I've got a 17-year-old terrier. He's old and he's rickety and he's going blind and deaf and we've just found out, and I'm not surprised, his heart is twice the size it should be. He's a lion-hearted little dog. He has lived a long and happy life. He was a Dog's Home dog. He'd been mistreated. That's 17 years.

Most of the dogs in this industry are not making it past three or four years of age. They're really only just out of puppyhood before they're catastrophically injured or put to death, discarded. It's completely and utterly unacceptable. 

Worryingly, last year, we're seeing litters are up. Last year the number of litters was 19. This year it's been 25. Last year, the number of pups whelped was 110, this financial year, 155. As the commissioner told us this morning, there are more dogs being bred right now ahead of the potential 1 January beginning of the transition period. It's hard not to form the view that the industry is preparing some fresh meat to feed into the pipeline just in case the bill passes and they've got four years left. 

I do refer honourable members to the Tasracing Annual Report. I'm sure many members here have met greyhounds. They are really beautiful dogs. A number of members, like some of us when we were younger, would have seen them being taken around by their trainers with muzzles on. We would have perhaps believed that these were a separate and different type of dog. A dog, given that it was muzzled, that was dangerous and that was part of the plan, to separate, in the public's mind, this species of dog. To paint it as a dangerous dog so that our natural empathy towards dogs didn't perhaps extend as fully towards them. 

They are a gentle, affectionate, goofy animal. They're a lazy animal, they're well known as 100 kilometre-an-hour couch potatoes. They are extremely lovable. Everyone I've spoken to who's adopted a greyhound is absolutely in love with them. I fell in love just a few days ago out on the lawns when I met Mighty Mouse. Mighty Mouse is a big brindle boy who's just come out of the racing industry. When I bent down to give him a pat, he was straight in here to nuzzle me. Leaned in, affectionate, loving. Unfortunately, I have two dogs at home and I can't take Mighty Mouse, but the next dog we adopt will certainly and necessarily be a greyhound.

Mighty Mouse is looking forward to adoption. There are plenty of dogs in this industry that never got the chance. I will take you now to the very short story of Tah Bernard. Tah Bernard died in 2021. He was just a year-and-a-half old. He was one of infamous trainer Anthony Bullock's suffering dogs. He suffered a broken leg during a trial at the Launceston track. There were no vets available at the trials, which is a massive integrity and animal welfare failing, I might say.

He was taken to the local vet by Bullock, but on leaving the vet, Bullock was seen and is alleged to have thrown the dog into the trailer. People who witnessed it saw and heard him yelping. Distressed vet clients and animal advocates raised it with us and it prompted an official investigation. There wasn't found to be any breaches of the Animal Welfare Act 1993 but his life, that dog's life, and ultimately his death, tells us something about the welfare issues at trials and at race meets. Imagine not having a vet there at trials, given what those dogs are expected to do and the risk to them.

Then, there was another industry commodity, otherwise known as Zipping Princess. She was born in 2020 in New South Wales. She passed through five trainers in four separate states. She didn't stay with any trainer longer than a few months. She was advertised on Gumtree and when she was collected she was full of fleas, flea dirt, dried skin and she smelled like sulphur powder - which is apparently a home remedy for fleas. She had a bloodied ear from scratching, bald patches, old scars, and her tail had been previously broken. She had no energy and she didn't want to eat; she was withdrawn and fearful.

A few days after being rescued off Gumtree, Zipping Princess was taken to the vet for emergency surgery because she was so sick, and that surgery revealed that she had scarring adhesions on her belly from a very poorly performed desexing. They were strangling her bowel. Her blood vessels were twisted and tissue around the area of the operation was dying. She got through the surgery but died. She was put to sleep the next day because her condition deteriorated. She was three years old.

Raider's Guide, 8 July 2025. He bumped into another greyhound - again at the Launceston track. He had a Tasmanian record of prize money of $664,975 from 79 starts. Raider's Guide was taken to the vet and a post-examination revealed he'd suffered cervical spine injuries. Raider's Guide was put down recently. We've lodged a Right to Information request to find out what happened to this dog.

Lipstick Lazy - another Bullock dog - date of birth 12 May 2023. Last race 10 November 2025. Scratched on 13 November 2025, dead. Don't know why, don't know how. Another dog expended from this industry, but we will find out a little more from our Right to Information request.

Just today we got more information about a dog called Just Regal. Fell out of the back straight on 11 November at Elwick. Was severely injured, a right-hind stifle injury. Was sent to the vet and a stand-down period of 60 days was recommended. Just Regal is now listed as deceased, just another dog discarded by this industry.

In many ways this push to end greyhound racing in Tasmania began with the Four Corners report that went to air in August 2015. I don't know how many honourable members saw that at the time, but it sent a shockwave through the nation. We saw cruelty, neglect, dogs in tiny cages. We saw what the industry describes as 'wastage', which of course is the early death and discardment and death of dogs; 'draining' where, because greyhounds have a particular blood type, they're taken to the vet before they're euthanised because their blood is useful for other more-loved domestic dogs and then their bodies were taken out the back and dumped. 

We saw evidence on Four Corners of live baiting. There was a possum and a piglet that was used for live baiting at bull rings that were covertly filmed for this program. It's all part of the industry's business model. And yes, there have been some minor improvements around animal welfare but the business model itself is static. It cannot change. On the back of that Four Corners inquiry, I rang Jeremy Rockliff, who was then the minister for Primary Industries with responsibility for animal welfare. I said, 'Jeremy, did you see Four Corners last night?' 

'Oh yeah, Cass. Oh, just -' and I said, 'Well, we need an inquiry here to understand what's happening with the industry down here.' And he said, 'Leave it with me.'

This is a minister in a majority government who didn't have to make any effort for an inquiry, but he organised it. He enabled us to make that inquiry happen. We heard extensive evidence from industry representatives all over the island, from animal welfare advocates, from whistleblowers who'd seen the cruelty, who'd seen the bull rings. We've had Mr Gatehouse cite that inquiry as some kind of endorsement of his industry. I was the only Green on that inquiry, totally outnumbered by members who either supported or were ambivalent about this industry with its demonstrated track record of cruelty and exploitation; but that said, the evidence within the report - if you set aside the recommendations that were a majority recommendation, because the Greens put in a dissenting report - that inquiry, the evidence within that report, is damning of the industry. 

We had evidence of cruelty, neglect, of animals kept in substandard conditions, being fed, bred - we had evidence of blooding, wastage and live-baiting right here in Tasmania, and it should have been a massive wake-up call. The industry should have been banned then. As a result of that committee's work, there were some reforms, and some of them have been good reforms. There's now better lifecycle tracking, in part because of the relentless tenacity of animal welfare advocates who doggedly, pardon the pun, pursued data on what was happening to these dogs. There's been a move away from routine euthanasia, although as we know, plenty is still happening. 

I left on the honourable members' tables sometime earlier this year the report undertaken by Animal Justice Tasmania, A Few Bad Apples. I hope members took the opportunity to have a look at that. Kristy Alger, who is a tenacious animal welfare advocate, used a drone to get footage of what's happening inside greyhound training properties. It is not isolated incidents for greyhounds to be kept in very substandard conditions, sort of like concrete bunkers with little narrow runs, bowls full of slimy water. If any member wants to really understand how uniform the treatment of dogs is in this industry in Tasmania and what's acceptable under the rules of racing in terms of their housing and feeding, I recommend going back to the A Few Bad Apples report. 

Of course, the most rotten apple of them all is Anthony Bullock. He has been busted for operating without a kennel licence up there near Exeter, with 80 or more dogs kept on concrete floors in wire cages. He didn't have a kennel licence for a decade. What did he get for that? A slap on the wrist, and he continues to operate. He was hit with a lifetime ban and charged with having live animal products on his property, which is code for potential live-baiting. That lifetime ban, as so often happens with cruelty here in the industry, whether any one of the codes, was overturned by the Tasmanian Racing Appeal Board. Anthony Bullock is not only still operating; as per the Tasmanian Racing annual report, he's Tasmania's number one greyhound racing trainer. His cruelty is being rewarded: the Tasmanian trainer of the year.

If anyone wants an idea of what it's like at Bullock's property, I've got pictures here of bowls full of bread that are being fed to his dogs; pictures here of dogs in cages that are not wide enough for them to stretch out, miserable-looking dogs in cages; here's Mr Bullock dragging a couple of skinny-looking greyhounds across the track. It looks like Elwick because Kunanyi is in the background; there's a couple of desperate greyhounds with their heads under the cage trying to make contact with whoever was taking the photo. I mean, goodness me, these eyes, miserable, sad dogs. 

Here's a picture of his vats, these are the vats that Anthony Bullock cooks Ben Yole's disposed horses in and we've got pictures of that. We've got pictures of the vats and we know that cycle of abject cruelty, it's perpetuated right there. Ben Yole was sending his discarded horses to Anthony Bullock, who was also busted for operating an illegal slaughterhouse on his property. Anthony Bullock kills those horses and feeds them to his miserable dogs when he's not feeding them bread.

Here's a picture of him cutting up a horse carcass; here's a picture of a vat full of dead horses. The response to all this suffering of sentient creatures has been a massive shift in public sentiment, after a long and dedicated campaign by some of the greatest people I've ever met in my life. Those campaigners worked with the Greens to deliver the biggest petition the Tasmanian parliament's ever seen: 13,500 signatures calling for an end to greyhound racing and the subsidies that underpin it. This is supported by Enterprise Marketing and Research Services (EMRS) polling that consistently shows more than 70 per cent opposition. The most recent EMRS poll showed 74 per cent opposition to this industry and 11 per cent support. 

I want to take this moment to thank these extraordinary women who have helped to deliver the reforms underpinned in the bill that it would be good if we could debate and pass: Emma Haswell, an incredible animal welfare advocate from Brightside; the indefatigable Fran Chambers, who was there back in 2016 when we had our first rally there with her beautiful greyhounds Paddy and Missy; Mel Fitzpatrick; the wonderful Rosie Saville, who was here earlier today to watch the briefings and I know works very hard inside the Liberal Party to protect the interests of these dogs; the terrific Deb Fleming; Kristy Alger; Andrea Dawkins from the RSPCA; and Mark Wild from the Dogs' Home.

I want to acknowledge the work of my colleagues in the other place, my friend and leader Rosalie Woodruff, who's been part of this fight for a long time and spoke on the bill in the other place; the member for Clark, Kristie Johnston with her huge heart, who is the chair of the joint select committee; and other independents in this place and in the other place who have been a voice for these dogs. We've established a transition oversight committee, as members know, that has examined the bill. We've called witnesses. We've heard evidence. The evidence we've heard points to an industry that's desperate to keep operating, animal welfare advocates who see the byproduct of this industry. We asked detailed questions on the bill.

There's no amount of extra consultation that will change the industry's position. In process terms, I understand why the honourable member for Murchison would want our committee to go back and re-examine those things that we've examined and potentially call for public submissions. The issue here is that you either support greyhound racing or you don't. In the end, it's that simple. Overwhelmingly, Tasmanians don't support greyhound racing. 
I will tell you who does support greyhound racing: that is the Tasmanian Labor Party. They support the publicly subsidised exploitation, mistreatment, injury and early death of dogs and that seems to be the hill that they want to die on politically. When the bill went through the other place there were six revved-up speakers, passionate speakers for the industry: Mr Winter, Ms Finlay, Ms Butler, Ms Dow, Mr Mitchell and Dr Broad. Not one of those honourable members of the other place spoke on the stadium order; nor, over the past two years at least, did they ask any questions about this hugely financially, socially and environmentally consequential project, that the evidence tells us will cause their voters and their constituents suffering as services are slashed to pay for it, but if we just step aside from the politics of it -

Ms O'CONNOR - Do you find something amusing, Mr Hiscutt?

Mr Hiscutt - Yes.

Ms O'CONNOR - Do you want to share that?

Mr PRESIDENT - Just continue with your debate.

Ms O'CONNOR - Putting that aside, ending greyhound racing is simply the right thing to do. It's the ethical and moral thing to do. It acknowledges that greyhounds are sentient creatures, that the greyhound is just another breed of dog. They're not a number, they're not a racing machine, they're not something to be disposed of when they have stopped making money. They have a heart, they have a soul, they give and feel love, just like we do and over tens of thousands of years, human beings and dogs have evolved together and we have developed a special kind of bond and a special kind of relationship.

Dogs are our companions, they are our friends and they are a family. Greyhounds, just another beautiful dog, deserve our protection. They deserve freedom and they deserve freedom from exploitation. They deserve our love and they deserve an end to this industry. 

If the motion is passed, which obviously the Greens aren't going to support, and I can't speak for the whole committee, but if the bill is referred to us to examine over the summer break, I'm absolutely certain, of course, that we will but the consequence of the delay I've outlined, and it's very significant, it's about the lives of these dogs, not just over the next few months, but over the next four years and after, and we should keep them front-of-mind. I will not be supporting the motion.

[3.37 p.m.]
Ms LOVELL (Rumney) - Mr President, thank you. I thank the member for Murchison for moving this motion and allowing us to have this debate. I will be making a brief contribution and I won't be speaking about the bill and Labor's position on the industry because that's not actually what we are here to debate right now.

When we debate the bill, we will put forward our position then, but this is not about whether you agree with the bill. It's not about whether you agree with the industry; this debate that we are having right now is about process. If this bill is passed through the parliament, we will have a very significant impact on an industry that supports thousands of Tasmanians.

This is a significant change that the government is proposing, and like every significant change - and we argue this all the time - people should be able to have a say. This policy was not taken to an election. In fact, you could argue that the opposite policy was taken to an election and the member for Hobart talked about this bill in comparison to the stadium order and that there was a lack of consultation on the stadium order.

Ms O'Connor - Well, you're leading with your chin.

Mr PRESIDENT - Order.

Ms LOVELL - That there was lack of consultation with the stadium order; the government's position on the stadium was taken to two elections. The TPC conducted a very lengthy process on the stadium project, including public hearings. The Public Accounts Committee had examined the stadium project on a number of occasions, so I don't think we can compare the two. I think there is a significant difference in the level of consultation - the level of say that people have had.

Ms Forrest - Even if you don't agree.

Ms LOVELL - Yes, whether you agree or not. Whether we agree or not with these policies is not the point, the point is the consultation and the process. The member for Hobart also talked about The Greyhound Girl Podcast and the member for Franklin, Mr Winter, an industry stakeholder calling on or encouraging people to contact their Legislative Council members. I would remind members that's exactly what the Greens did on the stadium and I'm not disagreeing with either of those things. I didn't raise that last week. I haven't raised it in saying that it shouldn't happen, in the same way that members of the public are welcome to contact us on any issue. I don't see the difference in an industry stakeholder calling for people to contact their MLC and anyone else calling on people to contact their MLC on any issue. As the member for Hobart said last week, we live in a democracy and people should feel comfortable to contact us about their issues and have their say.

I don't think it's any surprise that the industry wants to protect their industry. Of course they do. I wouldn't expect any different and it's no secret that Labor opposes this bill. Our position on that has been very clear. Again, regarding comments from the podcast, I don't think there was anything in that that would have shocked anybody in this Chamber. It's also no secret that we want a better process.

I want to make one more point about the briefings that we had, and there was a comment about people choosing not to attend these briefings. I didn't attend the briefings and I did that for lots of reasons. I'm fortunate enough in this instance to be a member of a party with a shadow minister who is engaged in this process and has been consulting broadly. I want to comment on behalf of the independent members in this place. Well, not on your behalf, but I want to comment to say that I know that independent members work very, very hard. They've had an enormous amount of work before them in this last month, since we've had this legislation tabled. To be honest, I don't know whether any of them would have found time to go to a briefing and they certainly don't have staff to do it, as we established yesterday.

I don't think that's a fair observation.

What we have seen here is a very significant policy position from the government that hasn't been taken to an election, that hasn't been put out for public consultation and that is a complete turnaround in less than five months. We had a letter of support from the Premier to the industry on 17 July. We had an announcement three weeks later. In between those two things was the election so we had an announcement three weeks later after the election that they'd changed their position. Fine, they're entitled to do that. you can make that argument, but that's not the issue here.

We had a bill tabled in parliament on 6 November, passed through the House of Assembly on 4 December, and the expectation is that it will pass through this Chamber by tomorrow. I'm not convinced that this bill needs to be rushed and I know there have been arguments put forward that it needs to be pushed through, but I'm yet to be convinced on that. Again, I will remind members that the only way this bill and those arguments are upheld, the only way this progresses is not only that we pass the bill, but that we pass the bill unamended because any amendment would require the bill to go back to the House of Assembly, which cannot take place until next year. The only way this issue can progress in the way that is being sought is if this bill is passed by us today or tomorrow, unamended.

We have had this debate many times in my eight years here in this place. I think we have probably had it nearly every year. It often happens at this time of year, in fact, that we are faced with something that is significant without adequate time and every time we have this argument - and again, this is not about your position on the policy or whether you want the bill to succeed but I have been in this position before - every time we remind people - people who want this bill to pass - that if we push ahead with this debate, if you want this bill to get through and we push ahead and people are not comfortable to vote in support of this bill, then there's a very real risk that people will vote against the bill who might otherwise be convinced if they had more time and a better process.

What we need here is a much better process. I hope the motion will be supported. I will certainly be supporting it and I look forward to hearing other members' contributions.

[3.44 p.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - I rise to support the honourable member's motion to send the legislation to the joint standing committee for scrutiny. Whilst we are fully aware that the bill passed the other place last week, it was presented in this Chamber last Thursday late at night and after what had been an extraordinary, complex debate on another divisive piece of government legislation. Perhaps the main difference with this legislation is that the opposition did not back the government, not that it's made any difference or led to any amendments.

Given the rapidity of its introduction, the legislation must be given the opportunity to be examined more fully and the very least in more detail. It is another piece of highly contentious legislation that comes with a range of views on its value or otherwise that have still to be properly heard in an objective setting. I believe there was a community expectation the second reading would be moved in our March 2026 sitting committee sitting period. One that will allow an opportunity to fully consider the import of community and industry stakeholders and for them to have time to formulate their own observations and advice to us as members of this place.

I understand some members are concerned that a delay would negate the 1 January 2026 commencement date in the bill as written. However, the bill does have the natural contingency where if it misses that date, then it can commence on any other day after which the act receives the royal assent. Parts two, three and five are unaffected as they come into play on 1 July 2029. By all means, let's have more haste in encouraging community input and have far less speed in bringing toward forward a rushed bill into debate.

It's one that competes with the possibility of unintended consequences that may come from the nature of its drafting, consequences that are better explored before it reaches the statute book rather than as an afterthought. As we all know too well, perfect hindsight in legislation is an expensive and complex problem to put right. I would hate for it to be the same with this bill.

Like many Tasmanians, I'm puzzled by the governments about face on what was its overt pre-election support for greyhound racing to what is now an immediate shift with the bill to close it down, to shut up shop and close the doors on every trainer and breeder. I'm also concerned that the Premier's sudden change of direction occurred seemingly with little to no consultation with anyone in the industry or community. It appears that Tasracing, as the overarching body for the three racing codes had very little any warning or input, if any before being told it was happening.

It's led to an understandable exasperation, despair in the industry and whilst many people oppose greyhound racing and government funding, we also have those in the industry that deserve empathy and if this bill passes this place a way to ensure they can exit with dignity, hope for their future and the opportunity to care for the animals they love. The Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition is still working through its remit and is yet to release the transcript of its latest hearing on 28 November - a hearing that allowed 75 minutes of input from five representatives of greyhound racing, 60 minutes for two representatives of the RSPCA and Dogs' Home Tasmania, and 75 minutes for NRE to provide input into the committee. That transcript alone deserves the opportunity for public feedback. A further examination of the bill from the committee would allow another level of scrutiny and more nuanced feedback to the members of the Legislative Council.

It's my understanding that the bill also includes references to a yet to be determined transition process with the Tasmanian Racing Integrity Commissioner to prepare and submit a draft closure plan for greyhound racing for the minister's approval or not. If the bill is passed the minister will have the final say on this. It's essential we get to consider the work and think of both the Joint Standing Committee and the commissioner, which will allow a more informed and fulsome debate in this place.

There's another problem with the bill being brought on such short notice. If we look to other community stakeholders such as Dogs Tasmania, Lure Coursing Tasmania and Sprint Dog Tasmania, they will not necessarily have had the chance to properly share their thoughts on this bill. A bill that may inadvertently or unintentionally prohibit perfect, legal, well regulated and totally amateur dog sport activities for every breed of dog, not just for greyhounds.

As a point of interest, an email from Dogs Tasmania gave an example of one of its concerns for what is a now well-established activity with monthly events across Tasmania. (TBC 3.49)

Lure Coursing Tasmania, an affiliate club of Dogs Tasmania, held a Sprint Dog training day last Saturday at Brighton. There were 50 plus dogs in attendance and around 90 people present. It was a huge day that was totally enjoyed by all present, both people and dogs. There was a great feeling of camaraderie with onlookers encouraging the triallers and their dogs while they are having their run. A great way to spend a day outdoors getting some exercise in good company. There is a real concern that these events will stop unless the exemption we have requested is granted or the terminology used in the bill to describe a commercial dog race is changed, as is open to interpretation the way it stands at the moment.

The fact that the bill as drafted risks an overreach into other dog sports activities needs to be considered. The fact that the bill is before us today gives almost no time for the greyhound fraternity and other stakeholders to prepare sufficient briefings, no time to consult with their members, and no time to draft a considered submission, as their organisation is run by volunteers who have jobs to maintain and families to support.

We have had an extraordinary busy sitting period which is now to the sixth straight week. It's one that's come about as a result of the election we didn't need to have and one that has log-jammed a tsunami of legislation into both Houses at the end of the year, perhaps in past years. This is now our new normal.

The intensity of last week's stadium order debate took us into incredibly late sittings, which, together with the essential preparation responding to the thousands of emails we all received, has left us little time to carefully consider this bill; one that was put up with some of its supporting papers less than a month ago.

I'd like to reflect on an e-mail I received over the weekend, and one that other members may also have received from a lady who, whilst being no part of the greyhound racing industry, has adopted two retired greyhounds. She sees the inevitable nature of the legislation and closed her e-mail with this plea. She said -

I'm not asking you to change your position on the matter. I'm asking that you consider the rushed process, the lack of opportunity for good consultation and ensuring people can maintain faith and respect in our parliament, its processes and the legislation created. I'm also asking for compassion and kindness through this process.

We need to restore our community's faith in our parliamentary processes. Whatever our position might be on the bill, we need time to carefully consider it with the attention and care it deserves. We also need the benefit of briefings on the work of the Joint Standing Committee, the commissioner, and from our wider community stakeholders. For those reasons I support the member's motion for the legislation to be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition.

[3.50 p.m.]
Ms ARMITAGE (Launceston) - I thought no-one was getting up, Mr President, so I thought I'd best stand quickly.

I thank the member for Murchison for bringing this forward. I believe the Joint House Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition should have received the draft bill for consideration and report. This is a proper committee process to enable all stakeholders to be involved. This motion will enable time to call for submissions, hear from the relevant stakeholders, and for all sides of the issue to contribute meaningfully. I believe it's a fundamental principle of good law-making that proper consultation must precede major legislative change, and it was mentioned by the the member for Hobart about the stadium.

I've always believed that there should have been more opportunity for the community to be involved, and I thought the community should have been able to vote on the stadium. Just like now, we were told about the consequences of not dealing with it in a timely manner. Hence, like today, I voted on a rational, not emotional basis. To me this is not about supporting or not supporting the bill. Referring the bill to a committee for inquiry and report is not a delay tactic. To my mind it is responsible governance.

I am concerned about animal welfare, social economics and regional impacts, as well as the mental health issues we've heard among participants and people assisting with rehoming; but, as I said, to me, this is the proper, respectful process that should have been followed and provides the transparency, evidence and accountability this debate deserves.

[3.54 p.m.]
Mr DUIGAN (Windermere) - Mr President, I thank other members for the contributions and indeed the briefings that we've had. The government has been clear since we announced the decision we intend to introduce the legislation this year, and I note comments from the Independent Tasmanian Racing Integrity Commissioner, Mr Sean Carroll, at the Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition; Mr Carroll in his evidence stated it was essential that the government get on with the job of progressing this legislation this year, and I quote, 'it is an essential requirement of making sure we have a clear pathway and transition.'

The time frame that has been developed takes into account good animal welfare, rehoming programmes and ensuring there is a clear pathway for participants that are going to be impacted by the transition programme itself. We heard plenty of detail on those points this morning and seeking to defer this legislation having been presented with no alternatives or amendments from those who would seek to oppose its passage, serves only to jeopardise the clear pathway for participants that are going to be impacted by the transition program itself, so the government doesn't support the motion.

[3.55 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, thank you. I don't have a long offering on this particular motion. I acknowledge the member for Murchison in bringing it forward, and acknowledge all other speakers. 

I am a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition and, yes, there have been two days of hearings, not two full days, but there have been two days of hearings, but what I would like to really emphasise that I've been somewhat surprised regarding the bill being tabled in the other place before the committee had a chance to look at the legislative requirements for the transition. That's clearly No. 4 on the resolution that was passed by both Houses.

To have that opportunity to delve into that and have a look at what that might look like in a committee process, I think, would be quite useful - whether it changes the views of members of the committee is another thing. As the member of Murchison said, when we had a discussion prior to the member bringing the motion forward, it certainly is a way of having information put on the public record. Briefings, we know, don't do that. We do not necessarily have that information for all members. By having it on the public record, you can go back and refer to it if that's what a member would like to do.

Today's contribution from Greyhounds Australasia raised matters that have that would be useful to explore - to flesh out a bit more.

Albeit that I'm not entirely sure that there will be a difference of opinion in the transition committee role at the end of this, I still believe that, particularly for the stakeholders who are going to be directly affected and who have a relationship with greyhounds or with the greyhound industry, I think they would benefit from feeling like there has been a more fulsome process with a committee looking at the legislative requirements moving forward. Again, I'm making no assumptions about what I believe that might look like in the future.

For those reasons, and I said I wouldn't make a long contribution, I am going to support the motion put forward by the honourable member and commit to doing my best at the intention of the motion to thoroughly scrutinise what that might look like. Just to flag with members that I do intend to move an amendment when the legislation comes before the House, but I will not go into that right now. I think that's important. 

I take on board the member for Rumney's comments that even if we were dealing with this today, I would have an amendment - it doesn't always mean that it will be supported, I absolutely understand that - but it's something that I'm working with a number of people about that particular matter. If an amendment was successful, then it wouldn't progress the bill any further today because it would have to go back to the other place and it may not be accepted by the House of Assembly, because it may go against something that the House of Assembly members feel was important when they supported the bill in the other place. 

Again, in regard to my support, as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition and the resolution that was agreed to by both Houses of parliament, I do believe that No. 4 of that including matters that were to be looked at by that committee, this is a relevant one; legislative requirements for the transition and -

The Council suspended from 4.00 p.m. to 4.30 p.m.


MOTION

Referral of Greyhound Racing Legislation Amendments (Phasing Out Reform)Bill 2025 to Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Rading Transition

Resumed from above.

Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr  President, I had all but completed my brief offering on this motion that's been put forward. I also look forward to hearing other members contributions on how they see the advantage of sending this through to the joint house committee that was established by both Houses of this parliament. 

[4.31 p.m.]
Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, I rise to speak on the motion from the member for Murchison, and I think it's a really understandable motion to have been put forward and, quite frankly, the government has put us in a mess on this one, no two ways about it. It would be unparliamentary to say it, but they've really shafted everybody on it, quite frankly. My position's really clear in that the outcome here, the policy outcome of transitioning out of this industry is one that I support. I've been very clear about that and have been for a long time, and been public about it.

I've been clear about that with the industry folk that I've been interacting with, particularly in recent times through the committee that I'm a member of. However, the way the government has gone about this has just been disgraceful. This is exactly what happens when a government cuts corners, when a government acts at all times, we can now see, in its own political self-interest rather than the public interest and evidence-based policy interest. It's completely happy to discard all good process and good governance to serve its own ends. That's how we've landed here today, which is really sad because I think it's done an absolute disservice to all the different stakeholder groups in this discussion and to this Chamber, quite frankly.

I think that's incredibly disappointing, to say the least, to say a mild parliamentary word rather than another one, but it's incredibly disappointing that we have been put in this position. Every side of this is now experiencing some form of detriment. We've got animal welfare advocates out there in the community, of which there are thousands. They are genuine, caring people who love animals, who regard them as sentient beings that deserve our protection and who in many instances do two things: they both work in a very practical way to deliver on that, by caring for animals, by volunteering for organisations that care for animals by adopting ex-racing greyhounds and others, but they also campaign and advocate on this issue and have done for years. 

It's a result of that very effective and tireless campaigning that we see at least movement on this issue here in the parliament, finally, because it's lagging the community view. We know that consistently, time after time in polling across recent years, including as recently as August, after the government's announcement was made about transitioning out of this industry, 74 per cent of Tasmanians supported that decision. This is an industry that is at the end of its social licence; it's been moving towards that for quite some time, and nobody could say otherwise. 

Quite frankly, the vast majority of Tasmanians, three in four, agree that this is an industry that should come to an end; then the question just becomes: how should it come to an end? That should be something that's talked about and discussed and consulted on and done respectfully, and that's absolutely not what the government has done.

Bringing in this legislation now, under this circumstance and in this way, has made it very difficult for there to be good outcomes for just about anyone. This is a problematic industry and now it's been encouraged to hope that there might be a reversal of policy decision here by impeding the passage of the legislation; but with legislation brought under these circumstances in this way, it's very difficult for a responsible Chamber, such as we are here, to pass.

It looks like on the numbers of things, we can probably all see what is telegraphed here; it's likely that this motion passes and this bill is sent to the committee, and so be it that that may be the will of the Chamber. That will delay passage of the legislation. I suspect we will still get legislation not dissimilar to what we've got before us, a process would have occurred though, and elements of that process will be important, particularly for certain stakeholders, but we will be delaying, and we will be encouraging those industry participants to hope that there might be a different ultimate outcome by doing that. 

That's a shame because there's still an unlikelihood that that's going to be what transpires. Certainly, looking at this legislation isn't about looking at the policy decision that sits behind it, just as, I'm sure, when submissions are sought, it is the policy decision that sits behind it that will receive masses and waves and huge numbers of submissions about it from both sides, no doubt.

It's a problematic industry. We know that there have been horrific practices in this industry in times past, but also carrying through to now, quite frankly. I accept that reforms have occurred, I accept that various improvements have been made, but my goodness. 

We know that there are some lovely people participating in this industry. We've met some of them today, in briefings. They love their dogs. They're small operators. They are the very acceptable face of this industry and they're the ones put forward, and I understand why. For them, I have compassion about the way this has been done, but equally clearly and highly concerning - and of enormous concern to anybody who has an inkling of care for animals in our community and in our state - is the fact there are still plainly very bad actors in this industry, acting atrociously, causing extreme harm to animals. 

That is absolutely going to be built-in. It's built into this industry, and that's partly because apart from the lovely local operators, you have big boys in this industry, and overlaying all of it, you have the gambling industry, which is an incredibly harmful, voracious industry that will assert its interests, its financial interests, to the nth degree, campaigning against anything that comes in its way.

That's tricky for us. We're interacting with an industry that has those different layers in it. Of course the ones put before us are the very palatable, very empathetic ones who are our local communities, who are participants in this industry, and who are in their hearts very genuine, and I accept that; but when the big parts of the industry - the powerful interests, the financial interests in this industry - send someone down to our state to lead a campaign against this policy that was announced, and that person tells the local people, 'Don't participate in consultation, don't get involved in having discussions about where to from here' once this decision had been made, then that's incredibly mischievous. It's problematic, it's harmful, and I think it's actually cruel.

That's what happened. Much as the announcement - the absolute backflip from the government for its own political self-interest, of course - was abrupt and awful for the industry to experience in that way, there was immediately put in place, at least from the Racing Commissioner's role, an intention to develop the transition plan, and we've got time up our sleeve for that because it isn't until 2029. It's about three-and-a-half years from now, given it's mid-2029 and we're at the end of 2025.

We have some time. That's why a transition plan would be needed but, of course, the Racing Commissioner, as he explained to us, was then in a pretty tricky situation, inviting people to consult and be part of a working group and talk with him about what's needed to feed through into that plan, to feed through into initial legislation, to form a basis for further development of the plan. That was stymied, and I think that was stymied not by the genuine interests of this industry, but by the big, powerful interests of this industry. That's really sad because the confusion, the hurt and the anger that would have been there when this policy was announced back in August, could've begun to be healed and assuaged from that starting point if engagement with the commissioner had begun in good faith then, rather than being discouraged at that point, and that's a shame.

I absolutely feel for the Racing Integrity Commissioner. He's been put in an incredibly difficult position by the government. He, in good faith, is developing the transition plan, he has formed a working group, he has invited industry to be part of that and beyond that initial invitation, from what he has described on the record to the committee already, is that he has been continuously reaching out and seeking to engage, and that sounds very positive.

He's also been in contact and doing extensive research with other jurisdictions that have done similar transitions, to inform his work around the transition plan and about the drafting instructions for this bill because when you, as he's described, look to other jurisdictions who have gone through or are going through a transition process out of this industry, there are some clear warning bells that sound over what needs to happen to ensure that outcomes are good for participants, but also for animal welfare and for the broader community. That's what the Racing Integrity Commissioner has expressed very clearly, that his job is to think of the interests of those three groups, if you like; the participants, the animals in the industry and also the Tasmanian community, because there are consequences.

If we do see this escalation in breeding trying to get ahead of an end date of breeding which would have, if this bill passed, been 1 January for new breeding but now maybe a little later. But, of course, what he has clearly heard from other jurisdictions is people will rush to try to breed quickly before an end date that's put in place. Given the announcement, the abrupt announcement, given him being tasked with the transition planning, given him being tasked with feeding through into the drafting instructions for this bill, he's now trying to get best outcomes, to give certainty to participants, to give protection to animals and to give the Tasmanian community the opportunity to have its interests seen to. In that space, what we're talking about here is how much is it going to cost the Tasmanian community?

There has been a clear commitment to a just transition. I have heard that clearly. It's been expressed in various places on the record. We need to keep pressing for that. The details of that are not clear yet, they come further down the track, but we do need to be clear that there is a fundamental starting point that's needed, which this legislation, from what we understand to believe, is the basis for that. It's simply fairly straightforward. It does two things: it gives the commissioner powers that are required, particularly for auditing and investigating across a transition period of time, and it sets up expectations and limitations on things like breeding, which addresses animal welfare issues for transition.

That's the bill. We're not debating the bill. I realise that. We're debating whether we send it to a committee, but what I'm speaking about here goes to my thinking around the advisability of that. 

This is a tricky one. As I said, I understand members in this place wanting to have more information and more time to consider something which is a policy decision from government being given effect - that is consequential; for groups of Tasmanians, it is very consequential and is permanent, although it is a phase-out. It's not immediate but it is permanent, ultimately, in that phase-out. So, we do, of course, all want to do our jobs responsibly and respectfully here. I understand that, and, as I can gather in the room, there's an interest to see this sent to the committee. If that happens, hopefully it is something the committee will be able to turn around quite quickly and have something come back so that any delay on some of the protective things in this bill isn't too long. We don't end up having a detriment to animal welfare that is too great. We know it's going to be a matter of hundreds of new animals brought into the industry and that is concerning to me primarily on animal-welfare grounds. Second, it makes it more expensive for the Tasmanian community to undertake the transition - the more the industry has desperately grown as a last-ditch effort ahead of a phase-out. That's problematic.

The committee will hopefully be able to bring something back to this Chamber, and the Chamber will then hopefully feel that two things have happened: one, that there's been a respectful process that at least allows all stakeholder groups on this matter to be heard in some sense. It's not just the participants of the industry that need to be heard; it's people in the Tasmanian community that need to be heard; it's, as the member for Mersey said, other potentially associated industries that need to be heard; it's absolutely the animal-welfare folk who are dealing with the outcomes of this industry that need to be heard, so all of those people will have a chance.

It will also allow more information to be on the record, so members in this place when this bill comes back, will feel they have information available to them to be able to make a decision, because the rubber will hit the road then. If this bill goes to a committee now and then comes back, the vote on that bill really is going to be about whether the phase-out goes ahead in this orderly and planned way, or whether, potentially, the government needs to find a different way to do it, which may be more rushed because we've taken up too much time. It may be less orderly than this; it might be done through measures that don't come through this place - I don't know. It could be as simple as just defunding, because ultimately that is what this is pegged to - 2029 is the end of the deed. I don't think anyone wants to be in that situation. It's a tricky one.

I'm always an advocate for good process in this place and for treating people respectfully. I'm also, though, an advocate for listening to the expert advice that's provided to us. Shame on the government for dropping us all in this position with its behaviour and its decision made under those circumstances, which was wrong and should never have happened. Since it has done that and the commissioner has had to step in to undertake the process, his clear advice to us at this point is that passage of this bill will provide better outcomes for participants, for animals and for the Tasmanian community. I'm listening carefully to that expert advice from the commissioner, and it really concerns me to put that aside. I don't think there's detriment in this bill, unless you don't want the policy to be enacted in the first place.

Of course, I understand that the participants in the industry want to do everything possible to try to push back on that; that's understandable. This bill, in and of itself, is not detrimental, other than it gives effect to a policy some don't want and others have desperately worked for for years. I'm going to not support the motion to a committee on the basis of being advised that given the situation we're in, the commissioner is saying this is what's needed. I understand that's probably not going to be the prevailing mood of the Chamber and so be it. I will certainly participate henceforth if that process occurs.

[4.49 p.m.]
Ms THOMAS - Mr President, I rise to speak in support of the referral of the bill to committee and thank the member for Murchison for bringing this motion for our consideration.

Given the rushed and unexpected nature with which this decision has been foisted upon industry participants and the parliament, I absolutely support moves to more fully consider the issues and impacts of an industry shutdown before any such decision to shut it down comes before this parliament for consideration. I empathise with greyhound industry participants and totally condemn the government's lack of consultation in coming to this decision as well as its deceit of, and disrespect for, the industry in its communication of the decision.

We've heard discussion about the industry through this debate today, and we've heard reference to statistics about animals being euthanised in the industry. I want to say that I know industry participants are listening. I know there are a lot of participants in the industry who do the right thing and care deeply for the dogs they race and rehome and our words in this place have an impact on people. It's important that we remember that.

I feel like it's grossly unfair to demonise everyone involved in the industry, and I want to extend my support to those who are listening to the debate today and who feel like these attacks are attacks on their character and they feel that deeply. I want them to be assured that not everyone in this place thinks that you are immoral and cruel.

I understand the sense of purpose and connection that many who participate in the industry feel and are provided, and I see that many people care for their dogs and treat them well. I know that listening to this debate is upsetting for some people and I'm sorry they have to hear it in this way without having had the opportunity to explain and/or defend themselves. In fact, this morning we heard Claire, a participant, explain to us just how and why three of her dogs were included in the statistics when it comes to euthanisation of dogs. In fact, they weren't put to death early. One was a 12-year old that was having grand mal seizures. Another was a 14-year old that had heart failure. They were not put to death early, but they were included in those statistics because, as an industry registered participant who still has those dogs in her care, they are included because they are dogs who are homed with a participant, despite the fact they are no longer racing.

I feel it is entirely reasonable that industry participants would seek to derail this decision, to have it reversed. It is entirely reasonable that industry participants ought to be able to at least have their case heard before the decision is made. That is absolutely their right, and we would expect that of almost any decision we consider in this place, and certainly hearing from industry participants is necessary for me in properly performing my role here.

To add insult to injury, the government is trying to rush this shutdown bill through this week, not only the last sitting week for the year, but the same week that the 90th Hobart 1000 greyhound race is being held in my electorate tomorrow night. I mean, talk about kicking people while they are down. The Premier betrayed the trust of industry participants by breaking the commitment he made during the July election campaign that the industry had the full support of the government. Just five months later, the government is trying to put the nail in the coffin at a time when the industry is celebrating a significant milestone.

At this time, the shutdown of the industry is a policy position of the government. It has not yet been decided by the parliament. It is a decision for the parliament, not for the government, not for the minister, and certainly not for the Racing Integrity Commissioner. Making something unlawful is a decision for the parliament and it needs to be a very carefully considered decision.

While I appreciate the concerns raised by the commissioner in the briefing this morning in relation to animal welfare and the impact should this bill be delayed, to that I say the government has created this mess and it's up to the government to appropriately regulate, under the reforms we recently passed, to monitor and mitigate these concerns over the period while this decision is fully considered, should this be referred to committee today.

I pride myself on rigorously scrutinising matters before the parliament, including hearing from all key stakeholders and analysing the detail. I feel I owe that to those affected by this decision. I owe that to my community. There simply has not been sufficient time to do the work required to fully inform a decision that has significant impacts not only on the welfare of animals, but on the welfare and livelihood of people too.

I appreciate the comments by the member for Rumney regarding the limited capacity for us to engage on this issue over the past month since the bill was first. I've had one day off in the last five weeks, Saturday, when I was absolutely exhausted, and even then I was trying to catch up in replying to texts and calls that I've received over the last week. I will not support the bill if it is debated today. I simply cannot say that in all good conscience that I've given the issue due consideration or that there's been due process afforded to those affected. I support the referral to committee.

[4.55 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, I want to make a few comments in closing the debate. To reiterate, I'm not here to talk about whether the policy should be adopted and the legislation passed. I'm here to talk about a proper process and a proper process that wasn't taken. As a person who does take proper process very seriously, I find it anything but acceptable that if that's a matter that you really value, you should always apply it whether you agree with the decision or the policy we're looking at or not. That said, I hear the member for Hobart's comments about the risk associated with this and I spoke about that in my contribution in moving the motion. I acknowledge the comments made by the member for Rumney when she talked about the very different situation with the stadium. It is a very different situation because that was taken to two elections, love it or hate it, and I think everyone knows how we voted in this place on the order. That is no secret. It was subject to various forms of scrutiny over the time and it was something that was not a surprise. The only surprise perhaps came from the Labor Party way back when they changed their position on it, but they're not in government.

When we look at this matter on its own, this is a very different situation. You have an industry that received a letter quite clearly and strongly confirming support for the industry from the Premier of the day. Yes, we had another early election and in order to retain power, one of the things that was agreed with the crossbench was to phase out the greyhound industry, but that was done without any recourse to that sector at all. That is a shocking and appalling way to deal with any industry, regardless of your view of it. It's just an unconscionable thing to do to anyone. The only way, in my view, the government can retain some credibility around this is to ensure that it does follow a proper process, consulting on the legislation and the transition process to at least enable the people to feel like they've been heard.

I will just go to the Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition terms of reference because, for the life of me - and one of the reasons I didn't respond to Mr Carroll's email was I thought, well, the committee's going to look at that; I will worry about it after then and I will get some more information then, because it clearly says - and I'm going to cut out the bits that don't relate to the bit I'm talking about - this is the motion that was that was resolved in both Houses:

That a Joint Standing Committee on Greyhound Racing Transition, be appointed with the power to send for persons and papers, with leave to sit during any adjournment of either House and with leave to adjourn from place to place to oversee the phasing out of greyhound racing in Tasmania by 30 June 2029 including matters of: 

…
(iv)	Legislative requirements for the transition; and …

That's pretty clear. Time pressures aside, I saw that. I supported that when that motion was moved in this House. I expected that to be the case. To be criticised for not responding to a broad-scale email to all members saying, 'Tell us what you think', when this was the process that I had agreed to, I find somewhat interesting to say the least. I raise the point about compensation not being in the bill. We've had assurances that there will be a just and fair transition for industry participants and others impacted by this proposed policy that has effect in the bill; but I've seen a number of quite solid commitments from government in recent times that have all been trashed. Why would I believe this one above all those?

There's no provision made, not for an amount of compensation, but at least acknowledgement that will be part of the plan, I think maybe that's something that should be included in the legislation. It's not there, and it's something that should be thrashed out by the committee, in my view, so if they're serious about that, then let's have a provision in there, otherwise we end up with the situation like we had with the expungement of historic offences. It was not until we actually got a provision in the legislation that we saw that occur, despite asking, despite a TLRI report that said it should. It has to be in the legislation, unless we are going to rely on ex gratia, and that's fraught in itself, for all the reasons we understand. 

It was the member for Hobart who talked about the committee which she was a member of, and she did hear from the Racing Integrity Commissioner about the bill and some other players on that, including some of the industry representatives; but I don't believe - and I'm happy to be corrected if I'm wrong - that the committee put out a public call for submissions. That's what a committee should do. That's how committees work. That's how committees are public-facing. That's how committees get input from the various sectors of the community. That's how parliament goes out to the people. That didn't occur. 

To say you had a hearing where you talked about the legislation is not the same. It's absolutely not the same as taking the parliament to the people, asking for submissions, pulling them in, making a judgement about whether or not - you consider all the evidence, you might get hundreds, thousands of emails. I've been on committees where you've got that. You don't hear from everybody. You pick a selection; certainly you hear from the representative organisations in my view, other committees may do things slightly differently. Then there may be some individuals who raise matters that are not in the general theme of other thinking, then you say, let's hear from this person; why do they suggest that? Why this person? See, why do they suggest that? Why do they think that? Why is that a problem? Not about the policy, but about the bill. The industry players themselves will probably need some assistance for that, but that's what the representative bodies should be able to help them with.

I hope the committee can help them with that too, to give them an opportunity. As to the concern about the potential large increase in puppies that will be birthed in this interim period, in my mind, we're talking about an extension until March next year. No one suggested a timeline on it, but if the committee is able, there's no reason why the work can't be done over February, early March. This House is not back until later in March. There is time to look at this matter and report on it. Obviously it would be an interim report of that committee, because it's a standing committee that's to oversee the whole transition piece, but any bitch that's pregnant now can only have one litter; and for those who are not in season now and are not pregnant, then they're not going to be able to necessarily get in pup until after this potential deadline. 

From the research I did and talking to others who are much more knowledgeable in greyhound breeding than I am, they're only on heat twice a year at the most, one to two times a year. The risk of using stimulants like IVF for greyhounds, it would be costly, for one thing, but it would also - sorry, not IVF, fertility treatment, sorry - would be costly and carries risks according to the veterinary sites I looked at, if you're going to use that. I think we need to be genuine about this, that the bitches that are actually likely to have pups during this period are probably already pregnant or were going to be anyway in the natural cycle of things. I don't dismiss that that will mean there's more dogs than there might have been born.

Ms O'Connor - I just don't think you can say that, because there's three months for these dogs to be made pregnant.

Ms FORREST - They can only have one litter a year, there's lots of restrictions around how many litters they can have. I think, from memory, it's three litters per bitch. They can't be impregnated too young and they certainly can't be too old, and so there is a limitation around that. I'm not saying people might not bring dogs within that timeframe that haven't had three litters already or are within that age range from the mainland, maybe they will, but let's follow a proper and decent process here. Let's not throw proper process out when we're making a significant and fundamental change to a sector of the community that - there's many who - public opinion is not in their favour, absolutely it's not, but proper process matters and respect for humans matters as well as respect for dogs and other animals. I think we shouldn't elevate one above the other here in this, and we should do our best to ensure that both can be considered in this.

I know there's challenges; I'm not denying that, I've not denied it in my original contribution, I'm not denying it now. The fact is that we shouldn't be here. This should have been referred to the committee, as I referred to earlier, when it was drafted. The government controls the timing of legislation that comes to this place, and I think it was the member for Rumney who made the point, that if we do seek to progress this legislation this week, it has to go through unamended to be in place to enable that 1 January date. Whether or not the member for McIntyre's amendment got up or not, but if it did, that puts pay to that, straight up. The government control their agenda. They should have thought about this. They should have referred the bill to the committee, as they agreed downstairs and up here, and they should have followed a proper process to give at least some confidence in the process, even though the outcome is likely not to be what the industry participants want, in my view. I could be wrong, that's a matter for another day though.
I thank members for their contribution. I think that numbers are probably there to be sent off to the committee. I hope the committee are in a position where they can progress it and bring it back to us early next year so all those players feel like they've had their voices heard because that's the least we can do for our fellow Tasmanians.

TAXATION AND RELATED LEGISLATION (FIRST HOME OWNERAND PAYROLL RELIEF) BILL 2025 (No. 43)

Second Reading

Continued from 13 November (page 51).

[5.13 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, I adjourned the debate before I actually commenced my contribution whenever it was recently -

Mr PRESIDENT - 13 November.

Ms FORREST - One day this year. I'm picking up right from the beginning. This bill makes two principal changes to Tasmania's taxation arrangements. First, it is tripling the First Home Owner grant from $10,000 to $30,000 for newly built homes and extending the payroll tax rebate for apprentices, trainees and youth employees until 30 June 2026. The government presents this as support for first home buyers and the construction industry. The reality is more complex and the fiscal implications more concerning, particularly given Tasmania's deteriorating budget position.

Increasing the First Home Owner grant to $30,000 is presented as helping young Tasmanians into home ownership. The evidence on whether these grants actually achieve this objective is decidedly mixed. First Home Owner Grants are a demand-side intervention in a supply-constrained market. I will just repeat that first time owner grants are a demand-side intervention in a supply constrained market. Economic theory and empirical evidence consistently show that demand-side subsidies in markets with inelastic supply tend to become capitalised into prices. In other words, the cost goes up. In plain language, the grant inflates house prices, benefiting sellers and developers more than buyers.

The Grattan Institute has documented this extensively. Their research shows that for every dollar of grant, first time buyers gain only about $0.60 in genuine benefit. The rest flows to sellers through higher prices. The Productivity Commission has similarly noted that the first home buyer assistance can be counterproductive if not accompanied with supply side reforms.

Tasmania has an extraordinary house price growth of 30.2 per cent over five years in Hobart alone. Our housing crisis is fundamentally a supply crisis. Stimulating demand through grants without addressing supply constraints risks making affordability worse, not better. The government argues this measure will stimulate the construction industry. Again, the reality is far more nuanced.

The Tasmanian construction sector faces genuine challenges, skilled labour shortages, supply chain disruptions and cost inflation. A temporary grant may provide short term activity, but it creates problematic incentives. Buyers will only have until June 2026 to get a contract in place, which will effectively mean even if supported, only those who are ready to proceed, had their land and approvals, or buy a new build off the plan are those already in the mix will be able to meet the deadline and thus there will be limited increase to new housing stock.

If they're buying off the plan, that house was already being built. This does not stimulate new builds, and it can be followed by a cliff of inactivity where we've seen the boom and bust in previous grant schemes.

More fundamentally, if the industry's constraint is labour and materials rather than demand, increasing demand through grants simply drives up costs, without increasing output. The grant becomes a windfall to builders facing capacity constraints. They put their prices up.

My other key concern with this bill is that we don't have fully transparent costings. In the briefing were told the bill was modelled on the similar scheme in 2020, or thereabouts. Much has happened since 2020, cost-of-living pressures are far higher, the percentage of an average wage needed to meet an average housing loan has increased well above CPI. People are struggling with cost-of-living pressures.

I asked a bit about this in Estimates from memory; there has been a lot going on. We do get a very interesting econometrics explanation about how it is worked out, which I had to dutifully send off to someone far more expert in the field of econometrics to - I think that's what's called anyway, I can't remember to be sure now - to determine if it did actually take into account some of those things, and possibly it seems to. The Leader may be able to comment on that when she sums up the debate at a later time. The inflationary issues that sit behind this remain.

The original $10,000 grant had a cost. It has a cost to the budget. Tripling it to $30,000 represents a significant increase in budgetary exposure. I note the Treasurer stated in a recent media comment that the expanded grant program is in the so-called interim budget. What seems to be lost is the promised in 2024 and 2025 short-stay levy to fund it. This was a promise in the 2024 early election and the 2025 early election as a mechanism to fund this to increase this from $10,000 to $30,000. I did clarify that in the briefing is correct, despite some of the other rhetoric that has been put around. That was the commitment from the government.
I went back and read the media releases that were put out in 2024 and 2025 from the government when the Liberal Party's website and server wasn't cacked - when I could find it - and it did confirm that.

It was on this basis this policy was formed. If the government is true to their word and is going to live up to a government policy commitment and election commitment, they should have brought that levy in with this bill. Then I would have far less problem with supporting it despite its inflationary nature. But here we are, we don't have that, we just have this. 

Given Tasmania's fiscal position, record deficits, exploding debt, every dollar of expenditure must be justified in my mind. If you listen to the Treasurer, every savings measure we will be contemplating, including getting rid of 2800 public servants, so surely, we should consider every expenditure item.

The interim budget that was tabled and just passed yesterday -

Ms Rattray - Finally today.

Ms FORREST - Yes, revealed a $395 million deficit for 2025-26 and net debt approaching $5 billion by 2028-29. We simply cannot afford poorly targeted expenditure that may actually inflate house prices rather than improve affordability and do nothing to fix the supply side in any measure anytime soon. The only people who are going to benefit from this are those who already have their land, already have their plans, already have their builder locked in, and already ready to go. We heard that from Mr Benjamin Price from the HIA when he briefed us a week or two ago.

It's for that reason I will be seeking an amendment to the bill to remove these provisions and encourage the government to reintroduce it with the short-stay levy sitting alongside it with with the relevant modelling, if necessary - because that's what they promised they would do. 

In the current budget situation, surely, we should be taking every measure we can to raise revenues where we can now that nothing's off the table, if we have the agreement with the member for Huon. All that's now on the table quite squarely and fairly and we have a commitment here that the government made. I know some of the commitments haven't been so rock solid, but I'm hoping this one might be. At least we can consider it in the context in which it was committed to.

I will get the criticism, I'm sure. I'm sure there will be some who will get up - probably the Leader on behalf of the government - and say, 'Well, people have made decisions on this, they went out and got their builder lined up thinking they were going to get the $30,000'. Well, hello, it's an election commitment until it passes this parliament. The election commitment also said we'll bring in a short-stay levy to fund it, so they can expect to get that when we get the short-stay levy in my view. Let's do it properly. Otherwise, every government promise means nothing.

The bill also extends the payroll tax rebate for apprentices, trainees and youth employees. In my mind, this is less controversial. Supporting employers to take on apprentices has merit, particularly given skills shortages in construction and other trades. Hopefully, there will be a huge demand for apprentices on a range of projects. Any way we can support, mostly young people - though not always as some are mature age apprentices - to be taken on is a positive thing. It's about employment, it's about pathways to good employment and I support that.

However, I do note some ambiguity in the bill's provisions. I note this extension appears to be limited to apprentices only when the current scheme covers apprentices, trainees and youth employees. Can the Leader explain the change in the policy in this matter. Is it a change? Is it intended that way to only be apprentices, not the trainees and youth employees also?

The fiscal cost of this extension also requires some transparency. I have a number of questions for the Leader on that with regard to this particular aspect of the bill. What is the foregone revenue? How many employers and employees are expected to benefit? That does come back to whether it's just apprentices or the youth employees and trainees as well. What evidence exists that the rebate actually increases apprentice numbers rather than providing a windfall to employers who would have hired the apprentices anyway? It's about trying to encourage people to take on apprentices - who were going to take them on anyway, the employer gets the windfall. I'm interested in what evidence there is that this actually makes a difference because, again, when we're going to be giving up revenue or giving away money, even if the intention is good, we need to be sure it's landing in the right spot and there is a benefit of it. We should be reviewing every plan and every process here that involves expenditure money to ensure that it is delivering the intended outcome.

I note the grant increase applies retrospectively from 1 July 2025. While this benefits those who were contracted between July and the bill's passage, retrospective tax measures always warrant scrutiny. In this case, the retrospectivity is fairly brief and favourable to taxpayers, so I don't oppose it in this regard. 

If the government genuinely wants to improve housing affordability and assist first home buyers, there are more effective measures. These include measures such as tackling supply constraints directly through planning reform, releasing Crown land where it's suitable, investing in enabling infrastructure and reducing development assessment timeframes where time delays can be identified - we all know time costs money in this area. Measures such as these would do more for affordability than demand subsidies and we perhaps should look to South Australia to see what have worked there. Second, if you want to provide first home buyer assistance, consider shared equity schemes or deposit guarantees rather than grants. These reduce the buyers' upfront barrier without emplacing the price signal in the market. Let's look at other ways of achieving the end we're seeking to increase the supply, not just give money in a supply-constrained environment. 

Thirdly, reform taxation settings that disadvantage first home buyers relative to investors. I note these are really controversial and I'm sure FontCast will be on the case next episode for even mentioning, but I hope they're on the member for Huon's case as well by this stage. Some of these are Commonwealth legislation areas that sit in there, so I'm probably at less risk there, but I think some of these changes should actually be considered and, in my view, they should be grandfathered. You don't apply anything like that retrospectively; you start from here and move forward. A lot of those levers actually sit with the Commonwealth, but I think we should be looking at all of it if we're serious about the fundamental human right of a roof over your head, we should be looking at things that actually work and don't inflate prices. 

Another thing, we should target support to those most in need. A $30,000 grant provided to all first home buyers regardless of income is poorly targeted. These are new home buyers. Someone purchasing a $700,000 new home receives the same benefit for someone who is building a far more modest dwelling. We actually need to look at how we target these sort of supports to ensure they hit the mark. Don't forget that - I will get to that when we get to debating the amendment at a later time - we should remember that if the amendment is supported or it moves that bit, the provision still stands at $10,000. It just takes out the increase. 

The policy logic of demand-side housing subsidies in a supply-constrained market is weak. The fiscal cost comes at a time when Tasmania can ill afford poorly targeted expenditure. I have here a second letter from Ben Price. He has written again to us, as has the Master Builders Association, asking members not to support the amendment which will come at a later time. I will read part of this letter he sent. This is the letter that Mr Price sent on 8 December. I'm sure that was after he briefed us. It would have been, yes. In the latter part of his letter, he says:

It is the HIA's understanding that the First Home Owner Grant increase is primarily funded through the redirection of existing appropriation of prior years' budget initiatives. They're not expected to be expended, including Homes Faster! Partnership Residential Land Rebate, and Homes Faster! Medium-High Density Development Grant as at budget paper No. 2, Volume 1, page 293.

And a separate dot point.
This is entirely separate from the Stamping Out Stamp Duty policy, which funds concessions for the purchase of established homes that is linked to the proposed short-stay accommodation levy. That policy, while well-intentioned, has a perverse effect of increasing demand for existing homes without adding supply at a time when Tasmania urgently needs new construction.

HIA acknowledges the extremely constrained budget environment and recognise that all members of both houses must weigh the budgetary implications of any policy before them. However, we strongly believe that housing must remain a central focus when compared to many other policy areas considered by the parliament. 

The First Home Owner Grant increase is a practical, targeted measure that will deliver significant benefits for Tasmanians and the economy. HIA strongly supports the passage of this bill and urges consideration of the extended time-frame beyond July 2026 to maximise its benefit. A short implementation window risks limiting uptake and undermining the policy objectives.

Ideally, their Stamping Out Stamp Duty concessions provided under the amendments within the Taxation Legislation (Affordable Housing and Employment Support) Act 2024, Part 3 should be ceased, with all funding for that program redirected to the First Home Owner Grant policy. These concessions were originally committed to be funded via a short-stay accommodation levy, a mechanism that has not yet materialised. Continuing to fund a policy that incentivises the purchase of existing homes rather than new construction risks worsening Tasmania's supply crisis. Redirecting these funds to the First Home Owner Grant will deliver far greater outcomes for Tasmanians by stimulating new housing supply while reducing overall cost to taxpayers.

It is the HIA's strong view that the First Home Owner Grant should be increased to $30,000 on an ongoing basis, funded sustainably through revenue raised via the short-stay accommodation levy. However, Tasmania should not delay in providing the First Home Owner Grant given the pressing need for supply across our state.  [TBC]

He did have other comments at the beginning of his letter. Whilst I hear what he says - and I have had discussions with him about this - the reality is, and what he said to us in the briefing, is that the short duration of this bill won't have much impact on increasing supply because of the limitations that we're all very aware of. I think he made it really clear in that letter the expectation was that a short-stay levy would be introduced to fund this proposal. I'm not saying we don't ever support it, though I have concerns about those sort of policies that do tend to inflate prices, particularly in a supply-constrained market. I'm just saying, do what you said, government: bring in that levy to support it and then talk to me.

To reiterate, the policy logic of demand-side housing subsidies in a supply-constrained market is weak. The fiscal cost comes at a time when we can least afford it and any poorly targeted expenditure should be reviewed and not done without the capacity to fund it - capacity the government committed to but didn't deliver or hasn't delivered. 

There is absolutely no doubt that Tasmania's housing crisis demands action, but it demands smart action targeted at the root causes. Inadequate supply, not blunt instruments that risk inflating prices and delivering windfall gains to sellers and developers.

The parliament must be clear-eyed about the limitations of this measure. It is not a housing affordability solution; it's a time-limited stimulus to the construction centre that may provide some benefit to first-home buyers but also carries real fiscal costs and risks. Evidence shows, and economists agree, that measures such as these primarily inflate new house prices. In this case, it would be by $20,000. These people are already getting $10,000. Policies such as these mean we will have to spend significant public money to transfer wealth from taxpayers to property sellers. In my view, poor policy and poor value for money.

I will be moving the amendments and urge the government to be true to their word and bring it back with the short-stay levy and then we can have a grown-up conversation.

[5.36 p.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - I rise to speak on the Taxation and Related Legislation (First Homeowner and Payroll) Relief Bill 2025. Before I seek the leave of the House to adjourn, I thank the member for Murchison for that detailed and nuanced explanation of all the failings of our housing system in Australia and Tasmania, and the enormous human cost of those failings as neoliberalism has infected the delivery of social, public and affordable housing for our communities and the people that we represent. I look forward to expanding a little bit more on that tomorrow.

Mr President, I move - 

That the debate stand adjourned.
Debate adjourned.


ADJOURNMENT

Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, due to the workload that members have had and that we have tomorrow, I move -

That the Council, at its rising, adjourn until 11 a.m. on Thursday 11 December 2025.

Motion agreed to.

Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move - 

That the Council does now adjourn.


Willow Court Historic Site


[5.38 p.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - I rise today on adjournment to draw attention to a part of Tasmania's heritage that is both profoundly significant and too often overlooked. It's the Willow Court historic site at New Norfolk.

As one of Australia's oldest and most extensive institutional precincts, Willow Court predates even Port Arthur, yet few truly grasp at scale or its significance. The site brings together stories of early settlement, convict transportation and medical care, intellectual disability and mental health care. It bears witness to the lived experience of some of the most vulnerable members of our community. It is not simply a colonial relic; it is a living chronicle of social change spanning nearly two centuries and increasingly relevant in an era in which we recognise the value of mental health and wellbeing.

The history of Willow Court is, however, confronting, complex and uncomfortable, and that very discomfort has too often led to neglect. Places that hold painful stories struggle to attract champions, even when they shape who we are. Willow Court has survived largely through the dedication of a handful of advocates rather than the sustained public investment it truly deserves.

	To understand its significance, we must begin before European settlement, the area known as New Norfolk was inhabited by the Leenowwenne people of the Big River Nation, who knew it as Wulawali. Their custodianship over generations and the trauma wrought by colonisation are part of this place's deeper history.

Then in 1807, European settlement began with the relocation of Norfolk Island's population into the area. A very humble early invalid barracks housed sick or injured convicts. In 1827, Governor Arthur ordered all sick convicts from across the colony to New Norfolk. Though Arthur imagined they could be all comfortably lodged at a very trifling expense, the reality was overcrowded and inadequate. Governor Arthur then commissioned a substantial hospital completed in 1833 known as the Invalid Barracks. The imposing building still standing was designed by John Lee Archer, who also designed the very building in which we sit today although, I assume, with a very different intended purpose.

In 1834, Willow Court held over 400 sick and mentally ill convicts. The complex continued to expand and by the middle of the 20th Century, Willow Court and the Royal Derwent Hospital housed around 1500 patients and employed a similar number of staff. For generations, it was a defining presence in the community. The hospital finally closed its doors around the turn of the millennium, leaving an extensive legacy and woeful, unappreciated history.

I recently met with Dr Richard Benjamin, consultant psychiatrist and independent advocate for the Willow Court historic site. He stresses that the six buildings still owned by the Derwent Valley Council form a core around which a world-class cultural, historical and educational precinct could be developed. These buildings, together with their courtyards, gardens and surrounding landscape provide a rare opportunity to tell the full story, not only of convict life, but of the thousands who pass through its institutions. Dr Benjamin also highlights the nearby Millbrook Rise Psychopathic Hospital, purpose built in the 1930s to treat veterans suffering from shell shock, the psychological aftermath of the First World War. This facility offers a rare insight into early military mental health care, adding yet another layer of historical significance. These assessments are echoed by archaeologists and historian Dr Warwick Pearson, who described Willow Court as:

Rare and highly significant as the only example of an entire 19th century mental institution preserved in its original layout and setting in Australia. 

The site's importance is now internationally recognised. Earlier this year, the Willow Court heritage site advocacy body became a member of the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience, a global network of former prisons, psychiatric hospitals, conflict zones and other places marked by systemic suffering and social change. This membership explicitly recognises Willow Court's potential as a site of truth-telling, a place where we can confront difficult history, listen to those who lived it and openly examine how ideas of care, control, disability and human rights have evolved. That truth is complex: Former staff and residents recall compassion, community and quality care, yet they are also painful stories of abuse, separation, restrictive practices and wider legacies of institutionalisation. Yet, through it all, there are remarkable stories of endurance, strength and resilience, reflecting the human spirit that persisted at Willow Court.

The International Coalition asked us to hold these realities together, not to diminish any, but to tell the whole story and to understand why Willow Court matters to our nation. Despite this international recognition and the undeniable potential, the site remains vulnerable. Privately-led redevelopments such as the Antique Centre, the New Norfolk Distillery and the widely-acclaimed Agrarian Kitchen demonstrate what is possible when heritage and enterprise are thoughtfully combined but these successes are limited. The great majority of the council-owned buildings are deteriorating, closed and inaccessible due to scarce resources.

The Invalid Barracks, Alonnah, Carlton, Frascati House and the Occupational Therapy Building are all at risk. Frascati House deserves particular attention. Built in 1834, it is the second oldest building at Willow Court. Once the summer residence of the colonial secretary, John Burnett, and for over a century, home to successive medical superintendents, it was renowned for its sumptuous interiors, complete with a ballroom and a celebrated garden tended to by patients. After decades of neglect and repeated repurposing, it now stands vandalised and semi-derelict and yet, the local council appears poised to sell Frascati House through an expression of interest process.

While the property is a huge financial burden for the regional council, transferring ownership carries significant risk; heritage fabric could be lost, the precinct fragmented and both state and national significance eroded. Such a sale could also set a dangerous precinct for the disposal of other key buildings, undermining the potential of a long-term heritage strategy. 

Willow Court has the potential to compliment Port Arthur as an iconic site in Australia's history. Whereas Port Arthur tells the story of punishment and retribution with the penal colony, Willow Court tells the story of care, disability, mental health and the lives of those institutionalised. Together, these sites could present a fuller and more understanding narrative of Tasmania's past. Imagine the potential in a fully restored, sensitively interpreted precinct open to the public, delivering high quality education programs that honour the past, offering interactive experiences that deepen engagement, hosting community events and gaining national and international recognition.

With strategic planning investment and effective governance, Willow Court could, within a few years and in a national context, become one of Tasmania's foremost heritage destinations and as a leader in national conversation about human rights and how they shape mental health care and disability in veterans' care. The bicentenary of Willow Court rapidly approaches; the site is more than just bricks and mortar, it stands as a testament to human endurance, care and history, its stories are waiting to be told, its lessons are waiting to be learned. The time for action is now. Time for the state government to step in and do what is necessary to save Willow Court for the community, for our shared history, and for future generations.


King Island - Bass Island Line Shipping Disruption

[5.46 p.m.]
Ms FORREST - Mr President, this is just a very quick matter I wanted to raise on Adjournment and it concerns the shipping service to King Island. I got a notification today - and I would have asked the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport if you'd been here at the time - the local community have been advised that due to required maintenance Bass Island Line has decided to postpone this week's sailing, which means that supermarkets and other local businesses will not receive their stock as planned. That means all supermarket foods that would be coming via the ship, which is a lot of the things that can't or are too expensive to fly that will not be in the supermarkets for a week. Getting quite close to Christmas, I might add. As the supermarkets have indicated, it's far from ideal especially during this really busy period.

I'm asking the Leader if she can ask an urgent question of the department and perhaps TasPorts as to what is the contingency plan should Bass Island Line's maintenance not resolve whatever the problem is, such that they can't go in when planned - which the weather's a bit ordinary as we've seen - what is the contingency to ensure King Islanders have access to food and necessary supplies while Bass Island Line is out of out of order?

The Council adjourned at 5.47 p.m.
