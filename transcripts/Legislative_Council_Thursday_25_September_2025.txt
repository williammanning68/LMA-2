MOTION

Tasmanian Industrial Commission into Parliamentary Salariesand Allowances - Disallowance

[11.06 a.m.]
Mr VINCENT (Prosser- Deputy Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move -

That the Legislative Council disallow, in accordance with section 3G of the Parliamentary Salaries, Superannuation and Allowances Act 2012, the determination contained in the May 2025 report of the Full Bench of the Tasmanian Industrial Commission into Parliamentary Salaries and Allowances.

I rise today to speak on the disallowance motion tabled in this place yesterday.

The motion moves that the Council disallow the determination contained in the Tasmanian Industrial Commission, as I will refer to as TIC in further parts of this May 2025 report, tabled in this place on 3 June.

The determination would see parliamentarians provided with a salary increase of 22.36 per cent. That is because the increases have been compounded from year to year by adding the increased amount to the previous year, which has increases from previous years already added to it.

The determination would also see increases in certain allowances and sitting fees.

Should the motion before us today and in the other place not pass, the determination will be gazetted and come into effect with back pay to 1 July 2025.

The government's position is that the commission's determination should be disallowed in that the increase is out of step with community expectations.

To provide some context to our debate today and for the benefit of newer members, including myself, the Parliamentary Salaries, Superannuation and Allowances Act 2012 provides the process for the setting of salaries, allowances and benefits for members of the Tasmanian parliament. Under the act, the TIC may inquire, report and make determinations from time to time on the amount of basic salary for parliamentary members and the kind and amount of any additional salary paid for roles, including the premier, deputy premier, ministers of the Crown, secretary to Cabinet and certain officers of parliament, and allowances and related matters.

The most recent report of the TIC was completed in May 2025. Its determination of the salary levels and allowances that should apply to parliamentarians relates to the period 1 July 2018 to the 30 June 2025, a period of seven years.

A determination of the TIC will be implemented automatically unless within 10 sitting days of the determination being tabled in the parliament both Houses pass a resolution requesting that the determination be disallowed and so not be implemented. If a determination is not disallowed, the commission will gazette a notice setting out the determination. This would result in the suggested specified amounts of the basic salary, additional salary payable for certain positions and the allowances and benefits are entitled coming into effect. If a determination does not come into effect when it is due to either because it's not been made by the TIC or disallowed by parliament, the existing basic salary, additional salary and the allowance for MPs continue until a new determination is made.

If a determination is disallowed, the commission must within 12 months from the date of the disallowance make a new determination. The TIC report was tabled in both Houses on the 3 June 2025. As the sitting days in the houses vary, there are two different dates for which a disallowance motion has to be passed. For the House of Assembly, this is today and for the Legislative Council, 4 November 2025. However, it is noted that the other place are dealing with the matter today. The determination can only be disallowed if in its entirety, not in part. Parliamentarians can opt to be paid a salary less than that specified in the report. If either House does not pass a disallowance motion, the determination will be gazetted and come into effect with back pay to 1 July 2025.

The TIC's determination would see the salary for Tasmanian MPs rise from $140,185 to $171,527.50. Earlier this month, the government offered a 3 per cent pay rise to public servants. It is no secret, post COVID and in keeping with governments around the country, our budgets need careful management. The government is committed to responsible fiscal stewardship, balancing the needs to support essential services with the imperative to maintain financial sustainability.

As members here would know, the government has already put in place measures to help put the budget on a more sustainable basis. It is clear that the current process for determining parliamentary salaries and allowances is not functioning. The fact that a pay rise has not been forthcoming since 2019 clearly points to the need for an alternative system that removes the onus on parliamentarians to accept or reject a determination. Indeed, I am advised that since 1973, at least eight different methodologies for parliamentarian salaries in Tasmania have been adopted and subsequently abandoned. Gradual increases over time in the context of the budget repair process are considered preferably to lump sum catch ups after seven years in a single year.

This would better align with community expectations and the experience of many Tasmanians where modest annual salary increases are received. The government will work through alternative proposals for addressing this issue. I believe I speak for everyone here when I say that we collectively enter this place for reasons of public service. We stand committed to a fair and transparent renumeration system that balances the load we bear as MPs with common sense expectations which will not see a 22 per cent catch up. Thank you, Mr President.

[11.14 a.m.]
Ms LOVELL (Rumney) - Mr President, members of parliament salaries are always an uncomfortably contentious issue, but this comes down to a very simple principle. Who should be deciding how much members of parliament get paid? The decision was made by previous parliament to give this work to the Tasmanian Industrial Commission for a very good reason. The last people who should be deciding how much members of parliament get paid are members of parliament.

It's important to recognise that members of parliament are in a position of power that can be easily abused. It is not healthy for democracy for members of parliament to have any say in their own pay.

Unions Tasmania in their submission on this work by the Industrial Commission dated April 2019, concluded with this statement:[tbc]

… a transparent and fair system of remuneration for MPs should not allow Parliament to veto increases awarded through any independent external statutory mechanism. Legislation which enables political interference with recommendations arising from annual reviews of salaries must be disallowed. In extraordinary circumstances, when it is the view of the Parliament that the decision of the Commission should not be implemented, then those arguments should be put before the Commission.

This comes down to a fundamental principle of who should be deciding how much members of parliament get paid. It should not be members of parliament. I believe this is what would be most in line with community expectations.

After much consideration and discussion with other members of parliament from all political parties, including independents, Labor will not be supporting the disallowance.

[11.16 a.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - Mr President, every time I have needed to speak about parliamentary salaries in this place, I have stated that I do not believe that politicians should be involved with the setting of their salaries. The decision to determine our salary should be left to an independent body, the commission. I'm very comfortable with that process.

This was the same stance I had in 2018. I note, as other members have, there has been no alteration to salaries over that time. The independent commission made their assess. I'm comfortable with that approach. I do not comment on, nor have I ever provided a submission to the independent panel. I will not support parliamentary political interference in the setting of my salary. I will not support the Premier's disallowance motion.

[11.17 a.m.]
Ms THOMAS (Elwick) - Mr President, let me start by saying that we are completely conflicted here. It is totally unreasonable to ask an employee to determine their own salary. Tell me one other workplace where this idea would pass the pub test. I can't think of one. None of us should be in a position where we're making decisions related to our own salaries. No-one should be, and we didn't have to be.

The independent umpire in the Tasmanian Industrial Commission has made the decision for us. However, one person in the other place, the Premier, has decided to challenge the independent umpire, which is hardly surprising given the government's pattern of behaviour when dealing with independent umpires. To put this decision before the parliament is extremely poor leadership by the Premier. It's selfish, extremely disappointing and I thought and hoped he was better than to play politics with people's livelihoods.

We shouldn't be here debating this, but we are, and I have a responsibility to contribute to the debate and make a decision based on what I think the people I represent and the people of Tasmania would consider to be fair and reasonable.

I'm pretty confident that the people of Tasmania would consider it fair and reasonable, even right, that we don't determine or make decisions on our own salaries. The people of Tasmania would rightly expect that we have nothing to do with those decisions. Leave it to the independent umpire.

I'm conflicted and I'm leaving this decision to the independent umpire. Therefore, I will not support the disallowance motion. That is the crux of it for me, but for context, I take this opportunity to further put on the record some of the background here, as the Deputy Leader did, and some of what the Tasmanian Industrial Commission's 105-page determination report actually says.

In the preamble, the report says:[tbc]

This Report into Parliamentary Salaries and Allowances has been undertaken by the Full Bench of the Tasmanian Industrial Commission (the Commission) under Part 3 of the Parliamentary Salaries, Superannuation and Allowances Act 2012 (the 2012 Act). In accordance with sections 3C and 3E of the 2012 Act, the Commission has conducted an Inquiry into the basic salary payable to each member of Parliament, the kinds of, and amounts of, any additional salary payable to members of Parliament holding specified offices, and the kinds of, and amounts of, allowances and benefits payable to each member of Parliament.

It goes on to say:

This Determination relates to the period 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2025. As a result, the increases which are recommended may seem large. However, they are based on the Wage Price Index or the Consumer Price Index, which track inflation and real movements in salary. The increases are calculated on 30 June in each year and are payable from 1 July of that calendar year based on the WPI or CPI calculated on 1 December in the previous year.

In respect to the salary component of the Determination, the sum of the annual increases over the relevant time (2018 to 2025) is a total of 20.5%. This is comparable with the increases provided by the Public Sector Wages Agreements. For the period 2018 to 2024 the Public Sector increases were 15.55% or 2.59% average over the 5 years. The increase recommended in this Determination for the same period is 16.6%.

The recommended average annualised percentage increase from 2018 to 2025 is 2.92%.

It will be apparent that the salary increase from $140,185 to $171,527.50 is 22.36%. That is because the increases have been compounded from year to year by adding the increased amount to the previous year, which has increases from previous years already added to it.

The recommended increase for members of parliament is comparable, though slightly more than, increases in the public sector wages agreements for a similar period. In our view that increase is modest and appropriate taking into account all the circumstances.

The Report does not deal with the question of backpay. Rather the determination calculates increases year by year. The Determination states that the increase commences from 1 July 2025.

It goes on to say:

For the avoidance of doubt, this recommendation does not provide for the payment of back pay or retrospective payment of the recommended increases.

The Tasmanian Industrial Commission, or TIC, has made a determination on what it believes to be a fair and reasonable salary and allowances for members of parliament in 2025. There hasn't been such a determination made for seven years, so the percentage increase in the TIC's determination provides for a 22.36 per cent increase in salary and allowances compared to the last time a determination on salary and allowances was made back in 2018. Let me be clear on this, it has been seven years since members of parliament received their last pay increase, seven years without a red cent more than the amount determined by the TIC to be a reasonable salary and allowance for a member of parliament in 2018.

As I always do, I turn my mind to what is the problem we are trying to solve here by disallowing the determination of the TIC. Is it that a 2.92 per cent annual increase doesn't pass the pub test? I don't think so. Is it that a 2.92 per cent annual increase framed as a 22.36 per cent increase in one hit doesn't pass the pub test? Maybe, if it's not explained in the context.

You also have to consider the unintended consequences here trying to solve the problem this way. That includes that this knee-jerk populist approach does not address the problem at its core. The real problem here is not that a 22.36 per cent annual increase over eight years doesn't pass the pub test. The real problem here is that the current process for determining the salary and allowances of members of parliament is flawed because in no other industry or sector would it be acceptable for a worker to turn up work every day for seven years, earning not 1 red cent more. Who would patiently wait for an enterprise bargaining agreement or other determination for seven years?

Members of parliament are effectively public servants. We are here to serve the public. Employees or unions associated with the public service would not accept a pay freeze without a red cent increase in seven years. Imagine the outrage if nurses, public servants, nurses, paramedics, police officers or construction workers even, were not provided with a salary increase for seven years. There would be strikes and public outrage and media outrage in support of those workers. In no other industry would it be acceptable for a worker to be in the position the Premier has put us in today.

I am relatively new to this place, so there not being a salary increase for seven years does not affect me in the same way it does my longer serving colleagues. It's worth putting its impact on the record, however, because I lament the fact that members in this place - and the other place - who have long served without the protection of all the other industrial relations laws rightly afforded to the public service and most other sectors, have been left behind in supporting themselves, their families and the electorates over the past seven years due to the delayed decision of the Tasmanian Industrial Commission.

On top of being left behind financially in that delay, the Premier is asking members to leave each other further behind in not accepting the determination of the TIC.

Shame on this government for playing politics with pay rises. There were other options they could have taken if they were concerned that this didn't pass the pub test. They could have chosen not to accept it themselves as a party. They could have chosen not to accept increases to ministerial loadings on top of their salary. As the Deputy Leader pointed out, any member can choose not to accept a pay rise and, should this motion be negatived, any member who votes in support of this disallowance motion in this and the other place can still choose not to accept the increase in salary. In my view, anyone who supports the disallowance absolutely should refuse to accept the pay rise. Their vote indicates that they truly believe that accepting a pay rise is not the right thing to do, so they shouldn't. That is integrity.

Unintended or not, the consequences of what the Premier is asking us to do are significant on a number of fronts. Elected members can only do the job for the love of their community at any financial cost to themselves and their families for so long. Now, let me be clear, I'm not saying that we are not paid well. I acknowledge that what we earn is more than the average wage. It is more than many people that we are privileged to represent in this place earn, but we have rising bills to pay too. Cost-of-living increases affect everyone. That's the reality, and the reality is that salary is a factor in most people's choice to pursue or not to pursue certain careers, including politics.

Further freezing the salary of parliamentarians beyond seven years could mean members resign for higher-paid positions in the Public Service, where there is less scrutiny and pressure and more family friendly hours, leave provisions and promotional opportunities.

Fundamentally, further freezing the salary of parliamentarians means it will be difficult to encourage well-qualified people to run for public office when they can earn more money, achieve good outcomes and be in a less high-pressure environment elsewhere.

It's pretty simple, Mr President, you don't get better leadership by paying people less money. We deserve to have the best people represent the state of Tasmania and its people, plus, delaying pay rises only shifts it down the track to where it inevitably has to increase by an even larger amount to catch up eventually.

It is not courageous to avoid a pay rise, it's courageous to make one happen in the best interest of Tasmania and its people.

[11.27 a.m.]
Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, I rise to speak to this motion feeling entirely conflicted and it's very unfortunate that we find ourselves in this situation. Every single one of us here in this place knows what a privilege it is to be an elected member, representing our constituents and working hard for their electorate. Tasmanians rightly expect us to work hard and to be motivated by public service. No-one would dispute that. However, I believe the Tasmanian community also expects public servants to be paid fairly, to have their salaries set fairly and to have reasonable annual increases applied, just like any public servant working for our state out there in the community.

I do not believe that Tasmanians would regard it as fair or acceptable for any public servant to take an effective pay cut every year, year after year. And yet here we are as members of parliament, forced into the inevitable conflict of interest, deciding on our own salaries after we've been in this very situation for the last seven years.

This is a broken system. We know it's broken because it allows a situation that we would, and the Tasmanian community would regard as utterly unacceptable for any other part of our Public Service. This system allows our salaries to be frozen in time, unchanging year after year, which effectively means that each and every year we're getting a pay cut. Each and every year since 2018, Tasmanian MPs have been getting a pay cut.

Now why somebody might say, but the Tasmanian Industrial Commission has, as an independent entity, made an expert determination on this and provided information to us about an appropriate pay adjustment to correct how far behind we've fallen.

It would be utterly unacceptable for any of us if a Tasmanian nurse or a teacher or a paramedic or a police officer were to have their salary frozen at the same level for a seven-year period. I believe none of us here would hesitate to argue that such a situation should be fixed, and it would be entirely reasonable to recalibrate their salary to where it should be and where it would have been if a reasonable annual increment had been applied.

That's exactly what's being proposed here in relation to our parliamentary salaries and allowances.

It was always going to be a problem for us to be the ones who have to tick off this increase or any increase or decrease to our salaries and allowances - as soon as the determination of the Tasmanian Industrial Commission stretched out beyond what was a reasonable completion time. I would have thought most of us would have expected it began in 2019. I don't understand why it couldn't have been delivered promptly. If it had, it probably would have recommended a standard annual increase at that time off the 2018 figure, and we would not have been in this politically difficult situation and having to deal with it here once a determination has been finalised years and years later.

We're now facing this suggestion of what looks, of course, in the public domain to be an unfeasibly big jump. The determination as soon as it began to take an extended period of time to be made, was clearly going to have to recommend a higher increment. It was only going to get larger and larger as more time passed. Yet, the government did absolutely nothing to avert what was inevitably going to occur, even though we've been in this very position, as other members will no doubt attest, many times in in years past, before my time here, I believe 2012, I think 2016 or 17, same conversation.

We knew this was going to happen, and we've got two clear problems now, both of which the government has failed to act properly on in relation to. The first problem is to resolve what will happen right now about allowing the TIC determination to come into effect. Where we get the pay catch-up, which is effectively what the TIC has assessed as reasonable. 

The second problem, though, more importantly as well, is how will we ensure this never happens again so that Tasmanian MPs are never put in this politically poisonous position of having to decide on their own salaries. The government should unequivocally commit today to reforming the system once and for all so that the politics is genuinely taken out of it.

There are numerous options we could consider. I'm sure all of us are willing and able to provide suggestions. None of us want to be in this situation ever again. If any MP feels uncomfortable accepting this catch-up adjustment to their salary, they are of course entirely at liberty to reimburse the state to the level they feel is appropriate or to donate any amount they feel is in excess to a charity of their choice.

The decision on this disallowance motion isn't one that should be made based on our personal circumstances. This is not a decision that should be based on whether or not you personally want or need a pay rise. We have a responsibility to lift our consideration of this above the personal.

This decision is about a very clear principle that we expect for all Tasmanians: fair pay with fairly assessed annual increases. The question of how much an MP is paid is not a personal question, it's a systemic one and it is fundamental to ensuring we have a strong, inclusive democracy.

We are all aware this is a unique and uncertain job. In this job there are many benefits and privileges that we all receive and there are also many sacrifices that we make. However, access to fair pay which has been fairly assessed should not be one of them.

This situation risks being a barrier, especially to those that may come from less privileged circumstances. You shouldn't have to be wealthy to become a Tasmanian MP, but if we expect our state MPs to take an effective pay cut every year and to do that time after time, that's exactly what will be required as a starting point here.

The people who are more likely to be excluded on the basis of this are from groups that need to be more present and represented in our parliament. Young people, people with a disability, people from culturally diverse backgrounds, women. We should not be putting more barriers and more disincentives in place for people from these groups to become representatives in our parliament and adding to the strength and diversity of our democracy.

We've waited seven years for the independent expert umpire to make an assessment of what would be reasonable and fair to update our salary and allowances. Goodness knows why it took so long for that assessment to be made, and clearly that is one of the broken parts of this system. However, the report has finally arrived, and I do not believe the parliament should now play politics with the determination it contains.

I regard the process of an independent assessment as appropriate and fair, and I support it being implemented. Once we've dealt with this immediate matter, which rectifies the indefensible error of seven years of frozen pay, then I expect the government to work with all MPs to fix this broken system so we're not ever again putting this position which invites political interference.

On this disallowance motion, I'm applying the same criteria I do for all decisions I make in this place. What does the evidence say? What do the experts advise? What is fair and equitable? And what is in the public interest?

On each of those criteria, I've decided to vote against this disallowance. It's the right thing to do, and I hope it becomes a circuit breaker because we are stuck in Groundhog Day. This situation has cropped up numerous times in the past, yet nothing has been done to fix it. No doubt about it, the Rockliff government in its faint-hearted incompetence has allowed this toxic situation to occur and it's now unwilling to show the leadership necessary to do the right thing.

We are inherently conflicted on this, and the three parties, unfortunately, Liberal, Labor and Greens, are in a death spiral of mutually assured destruction it would seem on this decision - and I absolutely applaud the Labor Party for coming out with a statement today and the intention to vote against this disallowance. They are willing to pull themselves out of that death spiral.

Previously, all three parties have voted to forgo the same sort of situation in the past on the independently assessed appropriate increase. No doubt they probably feel locked in to have to be consistent with those previous decisions. It is excellent to see that at least one of the parties is prepared to pull themselves out of that. This parliament established a system where we ask an expert independent umpire to examine, assess and make a determination. The rush to reject out of hand that expert independent determination is contrary to good governance and the rationale of removing political self-interest from this equation.

I promised I would speak briefly on this motion, so I will conclude now. Everybody can acknowledge I have spoken briefly, relatively speaking. Let me conclude by saying this. I am incredibly angry, quite frankly, that the government has put us in this toxic situation first by inaction and then, I think, by cowardice. I will be incandescent, though, with rage if the government seeks to weaponise the vote of this place in any way for political gain post this debate. It would be an astronomical hypocrisy if any of us here were pilloried publicly by the Premier or his government for voting against this disallowance and then they were to turn around and to take the pay rise that it may deliver. That would be a shameful path for the Premier to take. I caution him against it.

I do not support the motion.

[11.37 a.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, what value do we place on our work? What value do we place on the work of elected members of parliament? What value does the government place on the work of elected members of parliament? What value does the public place on the work of elected members of parliament? What are community expectations actually? And who should decide the monetary value of this important work? These are fundamental questions when we contemplate this motion before us. Incredibly, we're here today responding to a matter of political interference in the setting of Tasmanian MP salaries and allowances. This is inappropriate and it's wrong.

On the matter of parliamentary salaries, some members of the public would say we shouldn't be paid at all. We've all heard people say that.

However, there are far more members of the public who say to me that we should be paid more than we are. Many say they wouldn't want the job because they recognise the downsides of the job as well as the more visible upsides. I acknowledge the contributions of my colleagues here who have already spoken and that indeed there are many benefits and privileges of being elected to this place. However, the job comes with components that other workers and other public servants don't experience. I will come a little bit to that.

This job also impacts on our families, particularly those who don't live in and around Hobart and on a number of occasions has caused us to miss important family events. Regardless of this - and germane to this disallowance motion - is that most, if not all, agree that it should not be elected members themselves who decide what the right remuneration is.

The matter of salaries for MPs is political dynamite and a reason we should keep right out of it. Whilst not the first time this has occurred - and I am one of the longest serving members that others have referred to - the government's intention to disallow the decision made by the independent Tasmania Industrial Commission regarding parliamentary salaries and allowances represents another dangerous departure from the principles of independent determination on such matters.

This should not be a decision based on anyone's personal circumstance - the member for Nelson went to that point - whereby any individual may be in a position to say they don't personally wish the determination to be provided because of their personal circumstance. That is not what the TIC considered and it's not what we should be considering.

As has been mentioned by other members, any member can and has always had the opportunity to direct the pay office not to apply any increase now or in the future. Let that be on an individual basis, if any individual wishes to take that approach but don't interfere with the independent process that was tasked to do this work.

We have been here before. I have anyway -

Ms Rattray - And I have.

Ms FORREST - and the member for McIntyre, absolutely, but I will say again, we should not be setting our own salaries and allowances. I have been through this a number of times here and we absolutely need a proper, timely process that is not dependent on our approval or disapproval to set Tasmanian parliamentarian salaries. We need a process that is transparent, that does meet community expectations.

If you want to talk about community expectations, that's what they expect. A proper process that's adopted and applied. They want a process that is done independently from us so that we are not the ones setting our own salaries and allowances.

On this matter I have remained consistent throughout my time in this place, and we should not be able to interfere with the independent umpire's decision.

This is a problem to be fixed, so we are not back here again in a few years having another experience of deja vu as I've been having since this report landed, and on the day it landed, the Premier announced this course of action, months ago without even considering, it seems any impact that would have on his colleagues.

The former members for Windermere and Western Tiers who may or may not be watching warned of this very event in 2015 as well last time we were asked to interfere. Surely, they'll be rolling their eyes that we have not acted on fixing this process that seems broken.

I will mention a couple of comments reported in the media related to comments they made in this place at that time. (tbc 11.42)

Independent Windermere MLC, Ivan Dean, said:

The veto powers were nonsense. It still gives the parliament a say on parliamentary salaries, and we should be as far removed from that in all circumstances.

You can hear him saying that. Can't you, member for McIntyre?

Ms Rattray - From over there.

Ms FORREST - Yes, from over there.

The independent Western Tiers MLC, Greg Hall, agreed that the TIC's ruling should be binding. (quotes tbc 11.43)

The parliament should simply accept the TIC's decision.

He said -

They are the independent umpire.

And then Mr Dean went on to say further:

The further we fall behind, the greater the amount it is going to be in the long run.

He said. This is in 2015:

You can just see that in 8 to 10 years, a big catch up and no one will stand for that.

Where are we right here, right now? You could call them prophets.

Mr PRESIDENT - Nostradamus.

Ms FORREST - They didn't need a great deal of Nostradamus's skills to predict whether we would end up here.

We cannot and should not be cherry picking determinations, choosing those we agree with while ignoring those we don't. Such selective acceptance undermines the very foundation of independent determinations made at arms' length from MPs themselves. Yes, parliament does have the power to move disallowance on a range of matters and that is an important power the parliament has, but one that relates to a matter where all members are conflicted is inappropriate and it's wrong. Any individual members, as I've said, can elect not to take a salary increase if they wish. That's a personal decision and it will remain so.

The Tasmanian Industrial Commission determination results in a decision to pay members of parliament a salary that reflects the salary increases given to every other public servant over the last seven to eight years, while our salaries have remained entirely frozen.

This is a catch-up adjustment, and it does not even include back pay for those seven years. The back pay the minister mentioned was back until July this year, because that's when the determination would start if this disallowance were rejected. As other members have said, that would be unacceptable in the other workplace.

Let us be clear be clear about just a few of our different employment arrangements that also need to be put into the mix of this discussion. Members of parliament do not receive long service leave and there are paid superannuation in line with other public servants. There is no big superannuation package waiting for us when we leave.

Ms O'Connor - Everyone thinks we do.

Ms FORREST - I know. Despite the public perception that we do, we do not. We do not get any payout when we walk out this door. When we leave office, for whatever reason, whether we retire, we die, or we lose an election and subsequently leave as a result of that, the pay stops and there is nothing. Nothing. No payout, no annual leave catch-up. The superannuation we've accumulated is the same as every other public servant in the state.

This is something that has been looked at in other jurisdictions because it's often quite difficult for a member of parliament leaving this place to transition to alternative employment. If they've just spent a lot of money on an election, this is the only job we have to pay money to get the job - 

Ms Webb - To re-apply for it.

Ms FORREST - Yes, but I don't have a problem with putting yourself out to the people again. That's democracy. It is an important part of our democracy. However, if you've just spent a significant amount of your own money, money you may have had to borrow to run an election campaign, as I did in my first election - I had to borrow money to do it - then, having nothing when you leave and a limited opportunity for transition to further employment is another issue that we deal with. I believe the salary determination that we are provided takes that into consideration to some degree. I believe it adequately addresses that, but that's a matter for another day.

It is an honour and a privilege to be a public servant in this way. I don't diminish that at all. We don't do it for the money. Many members of this place, the parliament as a whole, could earn far more in other areas. If I'd stayed on my pathway in my formal role, I would now be on more money than I am now. As long as I was given the opportunities for promotion and things like that, which would be a matter for me to demonstrate I was worthy. 

This is an independent determination that sets what the commission believes after investigating this question for years, is the appropriate salary allowances that at Tasmanian MPs should receive. If the process has been ineffective, or have taken too long to reach a conclusion, then this should result in fixing the process not determining our own salaries. A disallowance would mean that Tasmanian MPs will continue to fall further behind comparable positions, thus negatively impacting our ability to encourage members of the Tasmanian community to run for office. Whilst not directly relevant to the actual TIC determination, freezing salaries as has occurred and falling further behind particularly disproportionately negatively impacts members who don't do not have independent wealth.

None of us does it for the money, as I said. Single income families, women, single parent families, members of both genders with young families who live outside of Hobart, particularly those with partners who are unable to maintain full-time employment due to the demanding hours worked by a member of parliament, their partner, combined with a high cost and in our regional areas, very limited capacity to access childcare.

Members have also observed that due to the high cost of living we all face, community organisations have increased their expectations of support. Local sporting clubs, of which I have many in my electorate, arts organisations. I support arts organisations around the state, because they really struggle for funding. Other community groups and young people seeking to support to fund opportunities to advance their personal growth have seen their needs and their costs increase significantly. The requests that we get through office, that is part of our allowance for financial support, have increased to the point where current allowances have not kept pace with these rising costs. Undermining, our capacity to assist those vital committee organisations in a meaningful way.

I know this because of what I could do when I first came in here and what I can't do now for the same organisations. We operate with one staff member to manage our electorate offices. This has not changed for Legislative Council members, whereas members of the House of Assembly currently have 2.5 FTE positions, enabling them to employ advisers. There is no equity in this arrangement, and it compounds our already substantial workload. This government decision, if it was to be supported, would further diminish the importance of the workload that we undertake and diminish the value of our worth as elected members.

I conclude with a quote from editorial by Anthony Hanover, the editor The Advocate newspaper, published on the 10 June 2025. This is when this thing first landed. I am going to quote directly, so this may be one word of unparliamentary language in here. (OK)

Our pollies deserve a bloody big pay rise, and, no, this is not a joke.

And he starts by mentioning me so I will use a bit of self-congratulations here.

Ruth Forrest is - as often the case - absolutely spot on.

While others play in the shallow end of politics, the upper house independent goes deeper. It would be slightly unfair to say Ms Forest is supporting a huge hike in politicians' paychecks.

Maybe she does, maybe she doesn't, but that's not the point.

What Ms Forrest is arguing is for is that the salaries should be taken out of their hands and linked to public sector wages.

That was the question that was put to me, and I responded that would be another way that could be done other than the current mechanism.

This makes sense and would avoid several issues.

More importantly, it would mean we wouldn't have headlines saying they are in line for a massive increase.

You couldn't say giving politicians 22.36 per cent pay bump passes the so-called pub test.

No one wants to sell that one, and especially not when they're about to head to an election.

There are older voters who still talk about a 40 per cent rise in state pollies gave themselves in in the early 1990s.

Bumper stickers said '40 per cent never forget'.

It's questionable if those outraged at the time, or now, understood the reason behind the big pay rise.

Too often, the playing of politics trumps a debate of substance.

That deeply unpopular move 30-odd years ago linking the wage of a state politician to 90 per cent of that of a federal one.

Ms O'Connor - It was 85.

Ms FORREST - I am quoting from an article.

Doesn't that actually sound fair?

Similarly, the recommendation last week is based on what the state public servants have received in pay rises over the past seven years.

Over that time, politicians have, in contrast, had their wages frozen.

The disparity between the Tasmanian state MPs are receiving compared to their federal and interstate counterparts has blown out.

The base salary is more than $30,000 lower than any other state or territory, while a federal MP gets at least $70,000 more.

Few might sympathise with the idea that our elected members deserve a fair go, especially given recent events, but they do.

As Ms Forrest says, pollies pays is never going to be popular, and that's why it shouldn't be in their hands.

I was really encouraged to see an editor of newspaper recognise that when most of the media coverage is about the big bucket of money we're about to get, if that was to be delivered.

The government's intention to disallow this independent determination sets a concerning precedent. It undermines the integrity of independent industrial processes and determination, and it devalues the work of elected representatives. We must ask ourselves, what value do we place on democratic representation. What message does this send to potential future candidates, and what precedent are we setting for future governments who may wish to cherry pick the decisions of independent bodies.

I will respect the independence and expertise of the Tasmanian Industrial Commission. I will not be drawn into setting my own salary as I've not supported this in the past, but I do agree we need to fix the problem that exists if the process is taking too long, and it does.

The fact that this process has taken too long doesn't make the decision wrong. It's the process that needs fixing and we need to stay well away from setting our own salaries. That is the bottom line. As I said back in June this year, politicians pay is never going to be popular and that's why we shouldn't be in our hands. It's political dynamite and the reason to keep right out of it.

We should not be able to amend or reject umpires' decision and that's what we're being asked to do and that's wrong, it's inappropriate and I'm so disappointed to find ourselves here.

[11.55 a.m.]
Mr HARRISS (Huon) - Mr President, I am three years into a four-year apprenticeship in this place. I am up for re-election next year, which isn't funny. I certainly don't claim to be qualified to determine what the remuneration for members of parliament should be. I do know is that we hold powerful positions and with that comes a responsibility to uphold integrity and transparency.

Back in 2022, I campaigned strongly on the value that independent members bring to this place. I did so because I believe governments should not be marking their own homework or rubber-stamping their own legislation. Cheques and balances are essential, and they are best delivered without party influence.

The same principles apply here. Members should not be setting their own salaries. The Tasmanian Industrial Commission is the appropriate body to assess and determine parliamentary remuneration. It is independent, impartial and guided by evidence, not politics.

What I believe we are seeing now is populist politicians interfering with an established salary setting mechanism to determine their own salaries and keep them lower than they would otherwise be to get a cheap headline in the media. And speaking of cheap headlines - and I am sure the Deputy Leader will correct me if I am wrong here and missed it - but I don't recall seeing a media release from the Premier celebrating the fact that the Liberal Party is to receive some $850,000 of public funding from the recent election. That's taxpayer money. In total, there will be more than $1.9 million distributed through public funding entitlements from an early election that by all accounts no one wanted. That could be classed as a cheap headline.

The Premier has claimed that the Industrial Commission's proposed salary increase is out of step with community expectations. That is not a valid reason to bring salary determination back into the hands of parliament. It is a massive conflict of interest. There is a principle here. The principle is that members salaries should be referred to the umpire in the same way that minimum pay rates and other award wages for other workers are determined. We should not be exempt from that standard.

I would like to see the day that the Premier was prepared to stand out the front of this parliament and argue that every Tasmanian paid from the public purse should have their pay packet reverted to the 2018 level and frozen, because that's what they are demanding through this disallowance motion. He would run a million miles before trying to impose that sort of pay regime on anyone else. It would not and will not happen and it should not be happening to members of parliament. We must leave the cheap populism at home and treat elected representatives of the community with the respect they deserve for the responsible job that we all hold.

In closing, I do, however, commend the Premier for sticking to his word on this issue. He stated before the election that he would not support the Industrial Commission report and he has remained consistent. I only wish the same consistency had been shown to the hundreds of workers in the salmon industry in my electorate, who would have appreciated similar follow-through on pre- and post-election commitments. I don't support the motion.

[11.58 a.m.]
Ms ARMITAGE (Launceston) - Mr President, I thank all the members who have spoken. I  couldn't have said it better. I, too, don't believe that members of parliament should have any say in remuneration or pay. We should be totally hands off.

The government needs to reform the system so we're never in this situation again. and I hear that they're thinking of doing that. But how many years have they had to do it? When we look back to 2018, we didn't know how long this would take, how long the TIC would take to give the report. But surely, during that period, the government knew that there was going to be a problem, and they could have looked at a system rather than leave it until the TIC delivers a report that they then say they're not happy with.

I did a little bit of investigating - and the member for Murchison stole a little bit of my thunder. That doesn't matter. I will do it again. An Examiner article that I found from 15 June 2015 starts off by saying:

The legislative councillors have warned that the state government faces a political timebomb over the issues of politicians' salaries and are pushing to remove parliamentary involvement in the issue.

That was 2015. Who was in government then? I cannot recall.

Ms Forrest - I can tell you, I can help.

Ms ARMITAGE - I believe many could actually help. It goes on:

The pay freeze for sitting members will end at the start of July, with MHAs and MLCs to receive a 2 per cent pay rise, taking their base salary to $120 thousand. The state government will soon introduce legislation to allow the Tasmanian Industrial Commission to make rulings on future pay levels, but any decision could be vetoed by a majority of both houses of parliament. 

I am sure Ivan and Greg will love to be mentioned a couple of times in this House.

Ms Forrest - I hope they're watching. 

Ms ARMITAGE - Yes, we should have told them. Independent Windermere MLC Ivan Dean said the veto powers were nonsense:

It still gives the parliament a say on parliamentary salaries, and we should be as far removed from that in all circumstances. The TIC can and must take into account the economy at the time. If we're not going to have faith in them to make the right call, then why the hell involve them at all? 

Independent Western Tiers MLC agreed that the TIC's ruling should be binding. 

The parliament should simply accept the TIC's decision. They are the independent umpire.


Mr Dean said that if politicians' pay did not keep pace with other jurisdictions, then the government risked a decision akin to the infamous 40 per cent pay rise of 1993. 

The further that we fall behind, the greater the amount is going to be in the long run. You can just see in the next eight to 10 years a big catch-up and no one will stand for that. 

As has been mentioned previously, that's exactly where we are now.

I'm not going to have a long speech. I'm simply agreeing with others that we need a proper, transparent process, independent from members of parliament. It is an honour and privilege to be in this place, but I don't have a place in determining what we are paid. I would hope that the government actually do take on this matter and deal with it so we never have a situation like this again. 

Members of parliament should not have any say in their pay.

[12.02 p.m.]

Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, members have extensively covered some of the background to this, so I won't go over that. I have a fairly brief offering on this matter, but to firstly say how very disappointed that I am to be speaking to this disallowance motion today and to also reaffirm my long-held position that members of parliament should not be involved in our salaries and allowances and the determination of that, and I'm disappointed that I didn't get any comment in the 2015 media article. The member for Windermere and the Member for Western Tiers were the ones that said accurately, obviously, what was felt by a number of members at the time.

I would like to make a point that, when the Tasmanian Industrial Commission was tasked with inquiring into parliamentary salaries and allowances and making the determination, it certainly had some comfort around that for myself. But how did we arrive here eight years later? How could it have taken so long for a body like the Tasmanian Industrial Commission to deliver a report? 

Now, it's not like they've forgotten about it, because I want to own up to the fact that I did make a submission. I've made a number of submissions over the years, not regarding the salaries and not necessarily regarding allowances, but certainly in respect to what I considered - and it has been touched on by the member for Murchison - was in having a resettlement allowance or figure for members of parliament who lose their position after a term because, as the member for Murchison said - I've not been in that position, but I have been in this parliament when someone was downstairs cleaning out their office on a Monday morning after they'd been here for a six-year term. They had no idea what they were going to do. Their car was going to be taken from the car park. They were handing back their phone, handing back their laptop, and their pay had finished. I felt gutted for them, and it was not right. In any other employment, you would at least have some holiday pay, particularly after 6 years you'd have some sort of entitlement and that was the reason that I put in a submission to the Industrial Commission.

Over the past 2 years I have emailed the Tasmanian Industrial Commission to ask where this report was because I was interested in that particular aspect of it - a resettlement allowance. I was also interested in when members of parliament would know if they were going to have an increase in their salaries, and equally important, an increase in their allowances. What do we do with our allowances? We support our community.

Have you ever tried giving anyone $50 of late, Mr President? It just doesn't seem to go down well in the community. The actual monetary donation and sponsorship that's now required, or you feel would be justified, has risen quite substantially over the past seven to eight years, and I'm always mindful because I also have a lot of those wonderful groups and organisations. A bowls club here, a golf day there - there are plenty of those. I haven't sponsored the Derwent Valley Golf Club yet, or Claremont where I believe your lovely wife plays Mr President, I'll leave that to you. There are so many of them in the electorate of McIntyre and I want to support them all, but it's becoming a real struggle and then when you have to say no to some of those Tasmanian-based organisations, you feel a bit mean, but you're thinking, 'Where am I going to get this from?'

As much as anything, I was particularly focused on the allowances that come with the duties, roles and functions of this position and I agree with the members who have said it is a privilege to undertake this role and to be able to support the people who gave us this opportunity.

I didn't get much of a return for my emails over the time. I had a look this morning. There were about six. They'll think I'm an absolute pest, but it didn't make much difference because we had virtually no response. If it had any effect, it certainly wasn't on the report being provided to the parliament in a timely manner. I'm annoyed that the TIC has also put us in this difficult position because who would expect that we would have waited 7 years for a report? Seven years!

I want to make that really clear. I heard somebody say, I think it was a quote from the former member for Windermere, 'If they can't do their job, don't give it to them. Don't give them the job'. That's one for a take-home message. I can take it.

I don't have a lot more to say. I will flag here that I will follow up with an amendment to the 2012 act that perhaps progresses a resettlement. That will be a discussion I will have with all members of parliament because there will be people who will lose their seat, lose their position in this place and have to walk out and pick themselves up. I am not sure what my mental health would look like after that, but I am sure it won't be about me - I will definitely hope it won't - but I am thinking about other people because I have seen them in this place, and they are absolutely shattered, and I can understand that because it's a tough gig.

It's pretty obvious that I didn't take the disallowance motion for the government because I can't support it.

[12.10 p.m.]
Ms O'CONNOR (Hobart) - Mr President, what a difficult and awful position we've all been put in again. As someone who's now served in both Houses, this is the third time I have been part of an unnecessary and, in many ways, unedifying debate about how much we should get paid.

If we look back to the 1996 '40 per cent never forget,' the Greens voted against that. During the global financial crisis when the state's budget was in an extraordinarily difficult situation - although nowhere near as strife-stricken as it is now - the then premier, Lara Giddings, moved to put a pause, if you like, on parliamentary salaries and that was supported by the whole House. I am not sure what happened up here.

Ms Rattray - Through you, Mr President, it was supported in this House because members recognised the time.

Ms O'CONNOR - Okay, thanks for the clarification. 

We didn't support the increased pay to MPs back in 2018 and we will be supporting the disallowance now. This has been a very considered decision that we've made as a party room after a quite extensive debate. We understand the importance of having an independent umpire make these determinations, but as a number of members have pointed out, we're in this position partly because the Tasmanian Industrial Commission left us hanging for seven years and there is now a pay increase on the table of more than 22 per cent, which is a catch-up determination.

We look at this in the context of the communities that we serve. I don't know exactly what Tasmanians would overwhelmingly regard as fair and reasonable in terms of the pay that MPs receive. I do know that in my community people are struggling to pay the rent, people are struggling to pay their power bills, their transport costs, and buy affordable food. For people who are living on the breadline or in economic stress, fair and reasonable is not a lump sum 22 per cent pay rise.

We have long argued that MPs' pay should be pegged to state servants' pay increases in an incremental process. We are, after all, public servants, but to date, our encouragement of various governments to do this has not been taken up. There seems to be some weird logic that if we peg MPs' salary incremental increases to state servants' incremental pay rises, then some government might give state servants a bigger pay rise so they can get a one, which is a deeply flawed logic.

I am inclined to agree that this pay rise, although it has been set by an independent umpire, is not in line with community expectations when there is so much hardship in our community and cost-of-living pressures are only intensifying, and we have a government that is doing too little to address that. 

We have been put in a very difficult position and when I say we, I mean the collective of the parliament by the Premiers move to disallow the determination of the Tasmanian Industrial Commission. But here we are looking down the barrel of a net debt of something like $13 billion according to the Treasury's financial outlook during the state election campaign, within two years.

We've had it confirmed by government that the plan to sack 2500 thousand public servants is ongoing. That is, the government is committed to sacking 2500 thousand public servants. Now in some part that'll be presumably in their mind to help pay down debt, but of course, as we know, in some part that'll be to pay for a stadium this state can't afford and doesn't need.

I have listened very carefully to members contributions, and I empathise with an enormous amount and agree with enormous amount of what is said. So far, there have been 8 speakers on this disallowance motion about MPs salaries. The other night when I brought on a motion about the risk to our communities caused by climate change, there was one substantive contribution from a member in this place, the member for Nelson, a very brief contribution from Mr Vincent, and then a winding up by the Leader for Government.

I simply note that. The most serious social, environmental and economic challenge of our times invited one substantive contribution from a member of this place and so far, on the topic of MPs pay there have been 8. I simply note that. While it has been a difficult decision for us as Greens, it is consistent with our long-standing position, our values and our appreciation of the context of the lives of our constituents and why we will be supporting disallowance.

[12.17 p.m.]
Mr VINCENT (Prosser- Deputy Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I thank everybody for their contribution and I understand it is an emotional and troublesome subject to openly talk about in the Chamber and the reason I'm fully understanding the reasons for frustration with that.

Mr PRESIDENT - Just before moving to the vote, I'd like to thank all members for your contributions to this motion and the respectful way that we've handled a sensitive topic and it's difficult that the government has put the Legislative Council in this position. I note that the Premier states that he wants to a cooperative parliament and I would remind him that there are two Houses of Parliament.

Members have spoken about consultation and there was certainly no consultation with me on this issue and nor should there have been, really, because it should not have been an issue that we've handled in this way. It was discourteous we all found out about this decision through the media rather than being notified.

Once again, the Legislative Council has been put in a position where it's had to clean up the mess. There have been other proposals that we can wait and handle it a different way, but we can't continue to keep the can down the road because at the moment there is a wall of tin at the end of that road and we need to move on these issues.

I question if and I hope that this now ends the political game-playing and the decision of the members of this House is respected.

The question is that the motion to disallow be agreed to.

ORDER OF BUSINESS

Deferral of Business

[12.24 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) (by leave) - Mr President, I move -

That intervening business be deferred until after consideration of Orders of the Day No. 5.

Motion agreed to.





COMMISSIONS OF INQUIRY AMENDMENT (PRIVATE SESSIONS INFORMATION) BILL 2025 (No. 37)

Second Reading

Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move -

That the bill be now read the second time. 

Moving this order up was discussed at the briefing this morning. Given the importance of this, I thank honourable members for their support in approving that. 

First, I personally acknowledge and thank the victim-survivors who shared their stories during the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings, the commission that concluded in August 2023.

I was deeply moved by their courage and commitment to improving the systems of government and protecting Tasmania's children. I also want to acknowledge the families of victim-survivors and for those who have not been able to share their stories. I also want to recognise that talking about this subject matter is difficult and can be re-traumatising. However, it is critical that we continue to have these conversations to improve our systems relating to the protection of children and young people in Tasmania.

It can also be difficult to listen to regardless of whether you are here in this place today or if you are watching this online. Please know that you do not have to do it alone. Support is available to you and please contact Sexual Assault Support Services or Laurel House at their 24/7 hotline on 1800 697 877 for free and confidential support. The Tasmanian government is committed to implementing reforms to assist victim/survivors of child sexual abuse, including by removing or reducing legal or administrative barriers where possible. I'm pleased to progress that work here today, in this place. 

The Commissions of Inquiry Amendment (Private Sessions Information) Bill 2025 has been developed to support this commitment, the purpose of which is to remove barriers to individuals accessing the information they provided to or for a private session with the commission. Private sessions are confidential meetings where the people can share their experiences with the commission of inquiry. These sessions are not evidence for a commission but a protected way that a commission can learn about a matter.

The commission held more than 120 private sessions across 2021 and 2023, which Marcia Neave AO, Professor Leah Bromfield and the Honourable Robert Benjamin AM SC described in their final report as sessions with commissioners. Private sessions were first introduced by the commonwealth for the purpose of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in 2013 to allow people to share some of their most confidential experiences. The strict confidentiality and protections around private sessions are designed to encourage people to engage with the commission and to provide a forum that is less formal or intimidating. 

Tasmania introduced private sessions via the Justice Miscellaneous (Commissions of Inquiry) Act 2021, which are largely modelled on the relevant provisions of the Commonwealth's Royal Commissions Act 1902 (Cth).  These amendments were introduced on the 1 March 2021 for the purposes of the most recent commission that was established on the 15 March 2021 and concluded its work on 31 August 2023. The 2021 reforms included protections which makes it a criminal offence to disclose a private sessions information except in particular circumstances. This offence is provided for in section 19C of the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1995, the 'COI' Act. 

An unanticipated consequence arriving from the 2021 amendments to the COI Act is that currently the records of a private session cannot be provided back to the participant of a private session with the commission unless they, and any person they spoke or wrote about, consent to that information being disclosed.

Whilst these provisions were designed to protect the privacy of individuals, they pose a significant barrier for people who are trying to access their own information that they provided to the commission for the purpose of a private session. This is because people could have mentioned the names or actions of a number of different people over many years when sharing their experiences.

The bill proposes to address this records issue by making a minor amendment to the Commissions of Inquiry Act. The bill introduces the new subsection 19C(2)(da), which provides for an additional exception to the criminal offence of disclosing private sessions information. The new exception enables a participant of a private session to record, or use, or have disclosed to them their own private sessions information.

When the former commission concluded in 2023, the commission's records were transferred to the State Archives for safekeeping. The new exception means that upon application from a participant, the State Archives will be able to provide a participant's private session information back to them without an offence being committed. The new exception will allow a participant of a private session to be able to use their own private sessions information as they see fit, in accordance with Tasmanian law and any applicable restricted publication orders made by the former commission.

This reform is critical as it is their own information they shared with the commission. It should be their choice what they do with their own information and experiences, just as they are free to re-tell their experiences as they wish. The new subsection in the final bill also provides further protections than what was originally contained in the consultation draft.

The Department of Justice identified the consultation version of the bill does not provide adequate protection for people who may have taken part in a private session with a co-participant. For example, a victim/survivor with a family member or another victim/survivor. This issue would be most acute in the instance of an audio recording or transcript of the proceedings where redactions may have had to have been made to someone's own information, which is very much against the policy intent of these critical reforms.

The new exception in 19C(2)(da) allows the participant to receive their private session information as long as it does not disclose the identity or lead to the identification of any other co-participant in the private session. However, the bill provides for a full record of the private session to be disclosed to a participant if the co-participant consents to that occurring. If the co-participant does not consent, their identity will be redacted. These amendments further empower people to receive a full record of their engagement with the commission in a private session but also protects the identity of any co-participant in a private session.

I note that the Department of Justice and the Office of the State Archives are currently collaborating to develop supporting materials for applicants who wish to receive a copy of their own private sessions information. It is important to note that this pathway will be independent to the RTI process. These supporting materials will be made available following the passage of the bill.

The other key clause contained within the bill relates to its retrospective effect. Clause 2 stipulates that the bill is taken to have commenced on 1 March 2021. As I have previously stated, this was the date of the introduction of private sessions into Tasmanian law through the Justice Miscellaneous (Commissions of Inquiry) Act 2021. This means that these critical reforms will be backdated to apply to the private sessions of the 2021 commission, as well as any future Tasmanian commission of inquiry.

I thank the stakeholder groups and members of the public who contributed to the development of this bill in the consultation process, and I note that several amendments to the bill were made as a result of stakeholder recommendations.

I would also like to thank the statutory officers who engaged with the Department of Justice during their consultation period. The Commissions of Inquiry Act 1995 is used widely across the statute books to support the proceedings of bodies like the Tasmanian Industrial Commission; the Land Titles Office; the Ombudsman, Tasmania; and the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Thank you for assisting the department in developing this critical reform.

The community rightly expects that people who have engaged in a private session with a commission should be able to have their own record of that information. I'm pleased to present this bill as a way to address this issue and remove a legal and administrative barrier for victim/survivors of abuse. Mr President, I commend the bill to the Legislative Council.

[12.36 p.m.]
Ms WEBB (Nelson) - Mr President, I'm pleased to rise to speak just briefly on this bill. Thank you to the Leader for reminding us that we are discussing a sensitive topic and mentioning the supports available for people who may need to access them, if this brings things up. I appreciate that.

In the midst of times when we debate lots of difficult and contentious things here, it's lovely to have a fairly straightforward bill come through that is about fixing a potentially painful thing, and where we can all agree on it being the right thing to do and we can make it happen. That's how I see this bill.

As the Leader described fully in her contribution - and I don't need to go into in detail - this is a bill that rectifies something that we probably didn't anticipate back in 2021 when the Commission of Inquiry act was being amended. Sometimes it's only after things have been put in place and we see it in practice that we realise it has not worked quite properly and has become a problem for some people.

In this case, it became a problem for people who are already in incredibly vulnerable situations, who had engaged with the commission of inquiry, often at great personal cost and sometimes harm, because they saw a greater purpose in doing so. They assisted the commission of inquiry in response to various situations of systems failing children in this state and to make it a productive and positive process withy tangible outcomes.

People who engaged in private sessions, probably never imagined that they would be prevented from accessing those records later. We may not have anticipated that we'd run into that administrative barrier either. It became an issue for me when I was assisting a constituent to do access their records and we ran into this barrier. I would like to put on the record here that in navigating that circumstance, the interactions we had with the department and the supports that we received to proactively look at ways move forward was exemplary and it was really appreciated.

It has taken a bit longer than we might have hoped to get to this point due to various practical delays in our political environment, but here we are, and this bill is now before us. It's a straightforward one. It does what all of us would think was sensible, that if you have had a private session as part of a commission of inquiry, you will be able to access those records later, should you wish, without requiring something as extreme as the State Archivist having to contact people you mentioned in those sessions to check with them that it was alright. because, of course, you never would have anticipated that the people you mentioned would even know that you had been in those private sessions, speaking about them and sharing your stories. It's your information and you should be able to do with it as you like, hence the retrospective effect that's important. It's backdated because we have had the experience of the recent commission of inquiry and people encountering this barrier. We need to fix that for them in retrospect and know that we have it in place for any future commissions of inquiry.

Protection of privacy is always a paramount consideration, and you can understand the positive intent behind the provisions that were put in place in 2021. In practice, however, that created a barrier for people to access information that belonged to them. I'm pleased that, once this bill - hopefully - passes and is implemented, it appears the process for accessing information, is not going to be via the RTI system or some other cumbersome process. It's going to be a fairly straightforward request and administrative dealing, so that's positive too.

We know from the RTI report released just this week that we don't want to further clog up our RTI system. In fact, that report identified that much of what's clogging up the RTI system is people seeking personal records and information from various government systems. That report points to the need to create a different way for that to occur so it doesn't clog up our RTI system and the fact that this is being dealt with separate to the RTI is positive and aligns with the findings of that RTI review.

That's probably all I need to say on this bill. As I said, it's a straightforward one. It's fixing something that wasn't working properly to the detriment of potentially vulnerable people and it's so pleasing to see it now being rectified and positively providing for those people to not necessarily come up against the barriers that they have been facing till now. I support the bill.

[12.42 p.m.]
Ms ARMITAGE (Launceston) - Mr President, this is a very simple, straightforward bill and I thank the Leader for Government Business for bringing it forward today. This bill will enable people who shared their experiences during the commission of inquiry in private sessions to help us better understand what happened, what went wrong and what we could to ensure that no child or vulnerable person could ever be harmed under state care again.

The commission held more than 120 private sessions from 2021 to 2023. Currently, records of these sessions cannot be provided to the participants unless they and any person they spoke or wrote about can sense that information being disclosed. For a great number of participants of these private sessions, mentioning names or actions of others, might now present a significant barrier to participants who want to gain access to their own records. To this end, the bill seeks to introduce section 192C(2)(da) to ensure that private session records can be disclosed to the person who gave the information, without obtaining the consent of each person referred to in those records.

As we heard in briefings, in the event that a private session had a coparticipant, this bill requires that person to consent to the disclosure to protect their identity. Where that consent is not given, their identity will be redacted. That is fair and appropriate.

Finally, this bill applies retrospectively to the records of the commission and to any future Tasmanian commission of inquiry. The commission of inquiry was one of the most significant and important inquiries in the state's history. It relied on the courage of many people who had to relive their trauma so that we could understand what happened. It would not have been possible without their participation and their help.

It's likely that ongoing changes will need to occur around the legislative framework of the COI, but I will always support anything that puts victim/survivors at the centre of these changes and ensures that their welfare and their wellbeing is prioritised.

This is a reasonably technical bill, but I hope it will make a difference to some of the participants of the COIs private sessions. I thank them and I support the bill.

[12.44 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I don't have anything to add to that. However, I acknowledge the member for Nelson's work with the department and thank her for acknowledging how conciliatory the department was. That is appreciated and on behalf of the government, thank you.

GOVERNMENT BUSINESS (SALE REFORMS) BILL 2025 (No. 42)

Second Reading

[12.56 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move -

That the bill be now read the second time.

This bill implements the government's pre-election commitment to introduce legislation that requires approval of at least two thirds of parliament to sell a Tasmanian government business enterprise or state-owned company. It also strongly demonstrates the government's commitment to keep government-owned businesses in public hands.

The government released its draft plan for review of the government business governance arrangements on 3 November 2024 with a review spanning the entire government business portfolio, including consideration to where the public ownership of each business remains appropriate and identify any businesses which should be divested or restructured. At this time, the government did not foreshadow the specific divestment of any one of the government businesses but rather sought to determine whether certain government-owned businesses could deliver a net benefit for the state and better outcomes for Tasmanians overall under a different ownership model.

The Tasmanian government business portfolio has a significant and valuable asset base, and the government recognises the important economic and social benefits that these assets provide. This is why the government announced that it will not be divesting any of the government businesses and the bill provides that a government business can only be sold if it receives two thirds majority support in the parliament.

There were discussions in the other place around the current provisions in the Electricity Reform Act 2012 where the Treasurer is vested with a broad authority whereby the Treasurer may sell all or part of Aurora Energy's retail business or that a subsidiary entirely on terms that the Treasurer considers fit. This is not a limited or conditional power. It allows the Treasurer to enter into contracts, to transfer or novate agreements, to move shares in subsidiaries, and to take any other action considered necessary to affect such a sale. The Parliament has no role in this process. This is why the reforms in this bill are so significant.

The bill proposes to change this arrangement by requiring a two thirds majority of both Houses of parliament before the retail business of Aurora can be sold.

This will ensure that any future decision to sell one of Tasmania's energy businesses is subject to the endorsement of the parliament.

To implement the reforms for our government business enterprises, an amendment has been made to the Government Business Enterprise Act 1995 to require that any proposed sale of a government business enterprise can only be progressed in accordance with the existing Government Business Enterprises Sale Act 2003.

The provisions in the government business -
