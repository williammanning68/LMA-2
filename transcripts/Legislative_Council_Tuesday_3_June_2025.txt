I now ask that you make the affirmation.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=191.1_D=9.5_C=0.67] Mr HISCUTT (Montgomery) - I, Casey Keith Hiscutt, solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty the King according to law.

Member sworn in.


STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT

Welcome to New and Returned Members
 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=232.3_D=21.0_C=0.83] 
Mr PRESIDENT - Honourable members, before continuing with our formal business, I take this opportunity to welcome to this House and to the Parliament of Tasmania the newly elected member for Montgomery and wish him very well in his role.

I speak on behalf of all members [Bookmark: Phr13_O=253.9_D=23.8_C=0.84] , Chamber officers and staff when I say we are ready to help you with any support, advice or assistance that you may require, particularly in the early stages of your elected term. The advice will continue right through your whole term here from time to time.

Please do not hesitate to ask. You will find tha [Bookmark: Phr14_O=279.0_D=3.9_C=0.81] t at times your role will be challenging, and you will need the support of others. T [Bookmark: Phr15_O=283.7_D=13.0_C=0.81] hat is the way this Chamber operates. If you have any queries, other members will be very pleased to help.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=298.3_D=6.6_C=0.90] I also welcome back to our Chamber the member for Nelson and the member for Pembroke, and congratulate them both on their re-election. Those of us who sat on the sidelines watching the campaigns, which is the best place to be, acknowledge the strong results that both these members got. It is a true indication of the high regard in which these members are held in their electorates and the work they do for the Legislative Council. It also reflects strongly on Tasmanians' knowledge of this Chamber of parliament and the respect they have for it. I acknowledge the members and their families and friends who helped with their re-election campaigns. In short, it is very good to see you both back.

Members - Hear, hear.


QUESTIONS ON NOTICE - ANSWERS

No. 29 - Independent Review by Mr Sam Tatarka on Legal Assistance for StateServants - Commission of Inquiry

[11.07 a.m.]
Ms PALMER (Rosevears - Acting Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I have answers to two questions.

Can I add my personal welcome to the Chamber for the new member for Montgomery? It is wonderful to have you here, and the member for Pembroke, lovely to see you, albeit from right across the other side of the Chamber. The two questions that I have are for the member for Nelson. Welcome back to you, too.

The first is question 29 on the Notice Paper, and it is about the independent review undertaken by Mr Sam Tatarka OAM regarding legal assistance provided to state servants in the course of the commission of inquiry.

This was a question to the Leader of the Government. In relation to the Independent Review undertaken by Mr Sam Tatarka OAM into legal assistance provided to state servants in the course of the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings, can the government: 

Confirm whether the Independent Reviewer completed the review and provided the final report to the government by December 2024 as the Attorney-General indicated was the anticipated timeframe in a statement to the Parliament on 27 November 2024; 

If the independent Review continued beyond December 2024, confirm whether it is still underway and if not, when it was completed and whether the final report has been received by government and if so when; and 

Detail when the review and any recommendations will be made public? 

ANSWER

I am responding on behalf of the Attorney-General and in his words:

As I have previously advised, 27 individuals were granted legal assistance under Employment Direction (ED) 16. The government received Mr Tatarka's report on 5 March 2025. Mr Tatarka has completed assessments of 18 of the 27 public officers in receipt of legal assistance under ED 16. The remaining nine will be completed by Mr Tatarka as soon as possible.

I have requested advice from my department, and I have instructed them to progress work to enable the release of the Tatarka report as permitted by law. As I previously advised, I will release as much of the report as permitted by law.


No. 30 - University of Tasmania - Borrowing

The second question from the honourable member for Nelson, is number 30 on the Notice Paper. This is about the request made by the Public Accounts Committee's inquiry into the University of Tasmania's financial position.

In relation to the request made by the Public Accounts Committee Inquiry into the University of Tasmania (UTAS) Financial Position, to the Treasurer, the honourable Guy Barnett MP, to 'provide a full reconciliation between the terms and conditions of UTAS's $350 million Green Bond borrowing' and the two borrowing approvals issued by the then-treasurer Peter Gutwein, upon which UTAS relied for that borrowing, and the subsequent response by the Treasurer that UTAS's 'current Bond Program is consistent with the approvals issued in March 2021'; can the government:

Confirm there was only one Treasury issued borrowing approval in March 2021 which was for $200 million, not the $350 million or $400 million claimed to be the borrowing limit of UTAS;

Explain why Treasurer Barnett failed to detail in his response to PAC the November 2019 UTAS's borrowing approval for $200 million issued in November 2019, on which UTAS must also have had reliance for the Green Bond borrowing;

Confirm an assertion of compliance or consistency, on the part of the Treasurer, is not the same as demonstrating compliance; and

Provide 'a full reconciliation between the terms and conditions of UTAS's $350 million Green Bond borrowing' and the terms and conditions of UTAS's two borrowing approvals, issued in November 2019 and March 2021, for $200 million each?

ANSWER

The Department of Treasury and Finance does not approve the borrowings of the University of Tasmania (UTAS). As has previously been advised to the Select Committee, under section 7(2) of the University of Tasmania Act 1992, UTAS 'must not exercise its power to borrow money unless it has first obtained the written approval of the Treasurer'.

From November 2019 - March 2021, UTAS's total approved borrowing limit was $200 million. In March 2021, the then-treasurer approved an increase of $200 million to UTAS's borrowing limit. This increased UTAS's borrowing limit to $400 million from March 2021.

The Treasurer's letter to the Parliamentary Accounts Committee, dated 8 November 2024, did not address the then-treasurer's approval in November 2019 of the $200 million borrowing limit, because it was not relevant to the questions raised by the PAC. There were no conditions attached to the Treasurer's borrowing approvals prior to March 2021.

The Treasurer's approvals prior to March 2021 were provided on the basis that the Tasmanian Public Finance Corporation's board continues to be satisfied that UTAS is able to service this level of debt and TASCORP is prepared to increase UTAS's borrowing facility limit. This is not a condition of approval, rather, it is an acknowledgement that access to additional TASCORP funding will be subject to TASCORP's credit assessment practices and board approvals processes, as is the case with any entity that seeks to borrow funds from TASCORP.


It is a matter for UTAS to comply with any conditions placed on the borrowing by the Treasurer. There is no legislative obligation for the Treasurer to actively confirm compliance with any borrowing conditions.

The only conditions applying to the collective approvals by the Treasurer for UTAS to borrow were those that were attached to the final approval in March 2021, which increased the borrowing limit from $200 million to $400 million. These were that:

UTAS obtains and maintains a standalone investment-grade credit rating from an approved agency.

The increase of $200 million to the existing borrowing facility limit is approved solely for the purpose of the construction of the Southern Infrastructure Project.

The $200 million borrowing facility limit will reduce over time, consistent with the maturity profile detailed in UTAS's request.

It is a matter for UTAS to comply with these conditions.
RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

[11.12 a.m.]
Mr PRESIDENT - I welcome the year 9 students from the Hutchins School, joining us in the Chamber today. You chose a really good day to come because you have been able to see a new member being sworn in to the Legislative Council, which is not something that happens all that frequently. We have just been through the formal opening of our parliament that we do every day in this Chamber and shortly we will be going on to our special interest matters before we move on to our orders of the day. All members here in the Chamber are very keen to put their thoughts on the latest state Budget down in this Chamber. I know they will also make you feel very welcome in the Tasmanian parliament, and particularly in the Legislative Council.

Members - Hear, hear.

Mr PRESIDENT - Our first special interest matter is from the honourable member for Huon. As he makes his way to the lectern, I also welcome to the Chamber his guests, Kerrie Duggan, Steven Duggan, Matt Duggan and Kelly Duggan. If there is a surname that screams out Huon Valley, it must be Duggan. Welcome to the Chamber today.


SPECIAL INTEREST MATTERS

Kerrie and Matt Duggan

[11.14 a.m.]
	Mr HARRISS - Mr President, before I start, I congratulate the declaration of the polls the other day. Congratulations again to the member for Nelson and member for Pembroke on your election. I also caught up with Casey today, the new member for Montgomery. Congratulations once again.

Today I acknowledge and celebrate two very impressive Huon Valley locals. One of the reasons I would like to talk about these two people is that I have been pretty slack in getting around to acknowledging in this place sooner, Kerrie Duggan, who received a Medicare Champions award. The other reason I have chosen to talk about these two people is the second one happens to be one of Kerrie's four sons, Matt, who, as I am sure most of you would know, took on what I would class as a crazy idea of running from one end of the state to the other. As you will hear, both are remarkable individuals.

Kerrie Duggan was one of only nine individuals presented with a Medicare Champion award at Parliament House in Canberra last November, the award for innovation and determination to improve healthcare services through nurse-led processes. It is a national recognition of Kerrie's tireless dedication to improving healthcare in rural and underserved regions.

With qualifications including postgraduate certificates in intensive care, midwifery and general practice nursing, along with the support of the practice where she worked, Kerrie completed her Nurse Practitioner training and qualification and was endorsed on 1 April 2011.

Kerrie, along with philanthropic investors, has co-owned the Cygnet Family Practice for 10 years, providing continued care and service for more than 2000 patients with six GPs and a team of over 20.

Tasmania has long faced challenges in delivering health care to its rural and remote regions. With an ageing population and a shortage of GPs, the need for innovative solutions has never been greater. Kerrie, alongside colleague Alison Spicer and with some state government funding, developed a nurse practitioner-led, community paramedic-supported urgent and after-hours model of care.

This three-day week service runs alongside the general practice and provides access to health care on the day people need it.

Practice data shows that 99 per cent of people who access the urgent and after-hours service can be cared for by nurse practitioners and paramedics. The clinic has provided an additional 1700 appointments in 12 months. The data also shows the initiative has saved the state government an estimated $520,000 in the last six months, relieving pressure on emergency departments and reducing ambulance travel.

Cygnet Family Practice's mission is kind, holistic health care with a community spirit. I have had the privilege of a guided tour of what was once an old residential house but now has been transformed into the current medical practice where the passion, dedication and care towards patients shines.

In an article in January in the Australian Nursing & Midwifery Journal, Kerrie urged nurse practitioners who have faced numerous barriers to practising over the years to not be disheartened.

These last two years there's been more doors opening than I have seen in the last 13 years as a nurse practitioner.

She goes on to say:

Getting the grant for the Urgent After-Hours service was invigorating because it supports the autonomous and collaborative roles of the nurse practitioner and community paramedic.

Kerrie and Alison have now set up NP Assist using their model of care to provide access to health care in other rural and remote areas in Australia.

Kerrie's passion and dedication over decades has had a profound impact, not just on policy, but on people. Families in the Huon and beyond now have better access to timely, high-quality care. Emergency departments are less burdened and patients in some rural areas no longer have to travel long distances for basic medical care.

I move on to the second individual, who, as I mentioned before, is Matt Duggan. Matt is what I would describe as your average person: 37 years old, a husband, a father to a beautiful three-year-old daughter and a good lifelong Huon Valley boy.

In April 2024, his life was turned upside down when he was diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer. Like many Australians under 45, he was initially told that his symptoms were likely benign, that he was too young for anything serious.

He had some samples taken which came back with some results of blood in the tests and was then told he needed to have a colonoscopy. Two days later he was on the operating table. But again, pre-op he was told that because of his age it will be nothing serious. Post-op in recovery he was told the surgeon would come and see him shortly. They just had to get his wife. As you could imagine, alarm bells started ringing.

They went into a separate room and the surgeon told him it is not some polyps that are causing the bleeding, it is a 10-centimetre tumour, and 'you have bowel cancer'.

Three weeks later, Matt had surgery to remove the tumour and spent a week in Calvary recovering. Three weeks after that, he started the first of 12 chemotherapy sessions, one week on, one week off. Every Tuesday he would meet with his oncologist, then sit in a chair and be pumped full of chemo for four hours, then hooked up to a little bottle of different chemo that was administered through a surgically inserted port. He was hooked up for two nights and then back to be disconnected on the Thursday. That continued for six months.

Matt kept his diagnosis and treatment private and hidden for months, not wanting sympathy or his normal day-to-day life to change. He was not ready for people constantly asking if he was okay or how it was all going.

As Matt sat through treatment, he began to ask the question too many young Australians are now asking: why me? And the answer, tragically, is becoming all too clear. Bowel cancer is no longer just an older person's disease. According to Bowel Cancer Australia, it is now the deadliest cancer for Australians aged 25 to 44 and the second deadliest overall. Yet our national screening program does not begin until age 45, and even then, participation rates remain below 45 per cent.

Matt decided that silence was no longer the answer. He wanted to shine a spotlight on the disease, particularly that it is not just an older person's cancer, and wanted to spread the word that young people with symptoms need to be tested.

Matt undertook an extraordinary challenge twelve months on from the operation: 12 marathons in 12 days, each signifying one of his 12 rounds of chemo. He left Cockle Creek in the beautiful far south on 3 May and finished at the other end of the state at Stanley on top of The Nut on 14 May - a gruelling 540-kilometre journey. It was not for personal glory but to raise much-needed awareness of bowel cancer. He also hoped to provide some vital funds to Cancer Council Tasmania. Along with him the entire journey were his wife Kelly, who you have mentioned is here today, daughter Halle, and his parents Kerrie and Steven, also here.

Matt's Marathon Mission has raised over a staggering $122,000, a testament to the power of community and the strength of one family's determination, and I believe donations are still open, so you can look up Matt's Marathon Mission. 

What became clear to Matt through his journey is how outdated and potentially dangerous the current bowel screening guidelines are, and I will conclude with some words that Matt flicked through to me:
We urgently need to lower the screening age and provide free, accessible testing to any adult who wants it, particularly those under 45 who are experiencing symptoms or have concerns. Right now, too many young Australians are falling through the cracks simply because they don't meet the right demographic. Many don't push for testing because they assume they're too young, or because the symptoms make it hard or expensive to access. My journey has been physically, mentally and emotionally challenging, but I'm one of the lucky ones. I got diagnosed in time. I now advocate publicly for increased awareness.

I again congratulate both Kerrie and Matt for their outstanding advocacy and dedication to not only my local region but broader Tasmania and Australia.

Members - Hear, hear.


Kitty May Ranson - 100th Birthday

[11.24 a.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre) - Mr President, I acknowledge the honourable member for Huon for sharing those inspiring stories with us here today, and congratulate Matt and Kerrie.

A couple of weeks ago, 24 May 2025, I attended a 100th birthday celebration for Kitty May Ranson, nee Cute, who has lived in the north-east for her entire 100 years young. Affectionately known as Kit, she was born in Branxholm, the second of eight children, and at the celebration of Kitty's life, she spoke fondly of her parents and her siblings growing up at Branxholm.

Kit grew up in hard times, being one of the elder members in the family. From the age of 12, she milked cows, washed clothes, scrubbed floors and helped take care of younger siblings among her daily chores.

Kit left school at the age of 15, doing odd jobs, and recalls scrubbing verandahs for two shillings as her first job, until getting a job at the Dewcrisp vegetable factory in Scottsdale when the Second World War broke out. She was employed making vegetable rations for the army. In an interview with the local paper, Kit recalled she hated the night shifts, there were no slacks to wear, and the water was going all the time to wash the spuds, and it was so cold.

They used to grow tobacco opposite the factory and that was where her then-to-be husband, Ken Ranson, was working before he came across to the factory. They married in 1946 at Branxholm at the age of 21 and went on to have three children: Garry, in 1949, followed by Craig and then Jennifer. 

Kit's birthday celebration was a wonderful event shared by family and friends and she certainly took the show and took the microphone for quite some time. At one stage her family said, 'Do you want to sit down, mum?' And she said, 'No, I am happy to stand up,' and continued on to talk about her wonderful life.

They sold their longtime home that they had built in George Street in Scottsdale and moved to Northbourne 29 years ago, and then, sadly, Ken died 25 years ago. But Kit is one of the only original residents left at the complex. She is still fighting fit, and she thinks it is funny that she only received a support plan from My Aged Care last September, 'because I was too agile'.

Kit looks after herself at home, still does her cooking, prepares her food. She does less cooking now. She only makes peanut biscuits and a fruit cake, 'because you can always cut at that,' were her words. 'I don't like bought cake. I make my own bed and I shower myself. The only thing I don't do is vacuum anymore.'

Kit has been an integral part of the community over her journey. Kit joined the North Eastern Soldiers Memorial Hospital Auxiliary in 1953, and volunteering has brought her much joy. She retired after 61 years of service to that auxiliary. She felt it was time to let the young ones have a bit of a go. It was with a heavy heart that she felt that she had done her time. She went on to say, 'Everyone is a taker today and they are not givers. I am not the taker.' She has certainly been a giver in our community.

Kit very much enjoyed sport and her husband Ken was a very good cricketer. It was no surprise, in some respects, that Kit certainly put in a well-earned century and continues to live a full life. Kit also joined the Parents and Friends when her children were all at school. She also held the secretary position at the child health centre, a really important aspect of community life, Mr President, as your mum will know, because we all met there on Friday mornings when we had children. The child health centre was a meeting place. You did not mind waiting a couple of hours to see the child health nurse, because she knew that you would catch up with other people. You would be able to have a talk about how your children were going.

Kit was also social secretary of the Presbyterian Ladies' Guild for 30 years. Kit has led a very full life and continues to look forward to that. It was lovely to have two of her family who live on the mainland, come over and bring great-grandchildren with them as well. That was a real joy. She noted in her interview to the local paper that the highlight was seeing her great-granddaughters, Chloe and Molly Bennett, who are five-and-half and three-and-a-half. She had never met them before, so that was a real joy when they walked in the door and came to celebrate 100 years young.

It was a lovely event, enjoyed by many in the community, but none more than Kit's devoted family. It was a pleasure to be invited. Congratulations, Kitty May Ranson. I look forward to celebrating another few milestones in the next few years.


Wynyard Wildcatz Cheerleading Team

[11.31 a.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, before I begin, I welcome back to the Chamber the member for Pembroke on a fine election result. It is always stressful, but the outcome was a significant recognition. I know the member for Nelson has left the Chamber but, in her absence, I will also congratulate her and recognise her significant result as well. It is always very gratifying to know your community holds you in such high regard, but it is always a difficult time when that is put to the test.

I really welcome my new seat companion - I have gone through quite a few in recent years - the new member for Montgomery. We are not only neighbours in the Chamber, but also in our electorates. I look forward to working with you and, as the President said, I am also here to assist with all the things that might seem quite strange in this place, as we keep changing what we normally do around here.

To my topic today. Mr President, if you had told me a few months ago that a cheerleading team from north-west Tasmania would be competing on a world stage in the United States and be crowned division champions, I would not have believed you. However, that is exactly what happened. In May this year, the Wynyard Wildcatz travelled to Orlando, Florida, to participate in an international competition with the aim of just having fun and enjoying the experience. They were not expecting to come home as winners, but they did just that.

The Wynyard gymnastics club is the home of the Wynyard cheerleading squad, the Wildcatz. The vice-president of the club, Tiffany Gregory, explained that 'cheer', as it is known, was introduced to gymnastics because it was seen as an accessible and inclusive activity for kids of all ages and abilities. She described the cheerleading program as fun, fast, energetic and catering for children of all abilities. There is an opportunity to learn choreographed routines, including stunts, jumps, tumbling and dance, to perform at statewide competitions.

There are various age groups: Mini Cubs, for children between five and nine years of age; Youth Pounce, for children aged between seven and 12; and Junior Jagz, for children aged between 8 and 15. There is also a recreational cheer program that is a non-competitive squad for children aged five years and over who wish to cheer without going on to take part in competitions.

The Wildcatz won the youth division at the Tasmanian championship in Kingston, in August last year, which enabled them to qualify for the international cheerleading championship sponsored by Nfinity known as The Finals, which is held annually in Orlando, Florida. The Finals brings together elite teams from across the globe, featuring performers of all ages and levels, from all-star squads to recreational teams. At first, it seemed impossible for the Wynyard Wildcatz team to take up this opportunity. Getting from Tasmania to Florida is no small feat, and it certainly is not cheap, but that is where the magic of the story happens.

A group of dedicated parents, including Megan McGinty, with the support of the team's coaches, launched a mammoth fundraising effort. They held raffles, events, sausage sizzles - you name it. They spent their weekends doing everything they could to raise funds for the trip, from hosting a Taylor Swift disco and a colour run, to selling show bags and braiding hair at the Wynyard Show. The original fundraising goal was $55,000, but over the six months of fundraising, the value of the Australian dollar dropped, and they had to up the target. With the help of some sponsorships and the amazing local community, the team was able to raise $64,000, enough to get them to Orlando.

Just days after receiving the final donation, the team, coaches and parents began the 27-hour journey to the Nfinity Finals. The Wynyard Wildcatz are a team of 12 girls aged between 6 and 12, many of whom have never even been on a plane before. Some of them have never left Tasmania, let alone travelled outside of the country. This is six-year-olds, some of them, Mr President.

Once at the competition, they were met by a spectacle unlike anything they had experienced in Tasmania. Abbie Brett, an 11-year-old competitor, told the ABC, 'It was very overwhelming, because, back where we live, when we go to the competitions, it's not as big as the competitions here. It was way bigger and a lot more nerve-wracking.' That is an 11-year-old. Her mum, Natalie Aiken, accompanied her and provided some of her own thoughts on the experience, describing it as 'completely mind-blowing' for the kids. She said, 'You just can't prepare them for what it's like over there. It's next level compared to what we are used to here.'

Natalie also spoke about the sense of global camaraderie among the competitors, describing the feeling at the accommodation facilities where they were staying, as being 'like a big family, where all the teams celebrated the achievements of others.' She described a moment when on the final day of the competition, a team of older girls from the United Kingdom made up a cheer tunnel for Wildcatz' girls to run through as a way to hype them up and encourage them for their performance. With teams from 12 countries from all around the world competing, there were inevitable language barriers, but the girls were able to overcome this and form connections, such as with the team from Ecuador. 'They found ways to communicate,' Natalie said. She made a final comment: 'While the parents were exhausted, the kids were living their best life.'

On day one of the two-day competition, the girls hit zero, meaning they did not receive any deductions from the judges. They did even better on the second day, receiving a superior score from the judges, the highest score awarded in cheerleading. The team ultimately took out the Youth Novice division. This success story not only highlights the team's dedication and talent but also underscores the community support and the potential for cheerleading to gain greater recognition in Tasmania.

While cheerleading began as a prelude act to other sport matches, particularly in American high school football, it now stands in its own right as a competitive team performance sport. Megan McGinty says, 'People think of cheerleading as girls with pompoms, but cheerleading is way more than that.' The team hopes the win will raise the profile of the sport here at home. It has already proven to be a good opportunity to introduce boys to the sport, with a number of new converts joining the Wynyard club. I understand it is common to see boys competing internationally.

I hope we can take this opportunity to not only congratulate the Wildcatz, but also to consider how we can better support community sport, especially for girls in regional areas.

I thank and recognise the contribution of the club and the coaches and family members and friends who have made this opportunity for these young girls possible. It is a massive effort. If you want to look at these young kids performing on the ABC, there is a video clip of them. They are little tiny things having the time of their lives. I urge you to look at it. It is truly beautiful, truly beautiful. More importantly, congratulations again to the Wynyard Wildcatz, world champions and local legends.

Budget Papers 2025-26 and Appropriation Bills (No. 1 and No. 2) - Noting

Continued from 29 May 2025 (page 32).

[11.41 a.m.]
Mr VINCENT (Prosser - Acting Deputy Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I too pass on my congratulations to the members for Nelson and Pembroke on their strong results and welcome them.

To the member to take the place of his mother on the other side of the Chamber, I hope you enjoy your time here and very quickly realise that although we might have different points of view on matters, we are cooperative in the way we express them, and understanding one another's different views is part of what we need to do to assess legislation and various other community things in this Chamber. All the best and welcome.

Before I move to the Budget, I would just like to acknowledge the member for Murchison's discussion on cheer. Sorell was one of the pioneers of cheer and I can remember having countless fundraising activities and many auctions of which I have a lot in my shed of things that I am not sure why I bought them, but it was all about raising money to send a lot of young people.

I also would like to acknowledge that cheer has allowed many young men to join in and show the cooperation at school level and the fitness that they can achieve on being involved in what is now regarded as a good sport. So, thank you for raising that today.

The 2025-26 Budget builds a better Tasmania now and for the future. It is a budget which continues to deliver our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future.

It continues to ensure we have a strong economy by backing business and economic growth. It delivers on things which matter by continuing to invest in our essential services like health, housing and education, while providing a sensible pathway to surplus. It gets the balance right.
As the local member for Prosser, first and foremost, I am proud of what this Budget delivers my local community: a 12 per cent boost to health services takes our investment to $10 million a day to ensure we can cater for increased demand; and a 5 per cent boost to education, supercharging our efforts to boost literacy rates and make sure our kids have contemporary learning environments.

I want to commend my colleague, Acting Leader of the House, Jo Palmer, for the passion and determination she has shown in this area. We are seeing tremendous improvements in student outcomes already and I look forward to seeing further success in our classrooms.

I have seen this firsthand with the investment towards Sorell and Brighton schools, which is absolutely proving very beneficial for students and for parents, which flows on throughout the community.

Our Budget also invests more than $500 million to building 10,000 more social and affordable homes. Many communities in my electorate are growing rapidly. Like Sorell, it continues to grow, and we need to continue building more homes, unlocking the land needed, but also building the amenities and, importantly for me as minister, infrastructure that they need to thrive.

The Budget also continues our record investment in cost-of-living measures. Over $500 million in concessions, relief and discounts are available to those who need them most. Whether it is half-price bus fares for regional routes, more healthy school lunches for our children so they do not go without or the $60 credit on every Tasmanian's household energy bill, which is being applied as we speak, we are continuing to do what we can to take the pressure off Tasmanians.

Locally, my communities are also benefiting through this Budget. Local schools are being upgraded at Campbell Town and Dodges Ferry. I can say that for Dodges Ferry, over the last eight years, it has been a long haul to get a school that has had no extra space at all. In an area like that where there is not already water and sewerage, you have to work through many different issues to get that upgrade. Once again, I thank the minister for making sure that Dodges Ferry is in that school rebuild; it really needs it.

A new ambulance station is being built at Bicheno. We are delivering further upgrades at the Midlands Multipurpose Health Centre.

We continue to rebuild the roads Tasmanians travel on every day, including duplicating the Sorell and Midway Point causeways and works on the Tasman Highway between Bicheno and Coles Bay and north of Triabunna.

I also want to briefly mention our investment in the Greater South East Irrigation Scheme, which is a huge win for my region and has been brought forward by my colleague in the other place, Ms Jane Howlett. The south-east is traditionally one of the driest areas in the state. A reliable water supply through irrigation schemes means not only our farmers and agricultural sector, but that we can also produce more food and fibre for domestic and export markets. The Greater South East Irrigation Scheme underpins jobs growth, drives new farm investment and supports economic growth. With $63 million in this year's budget, Tasmanian Irrigation can get on with the job of delivering this game-changing project.

The value of viticulture and agriculture continues to grow and creates new employment opportunities both locally and nationally. I have seen firsthand over the last 10 years how the first part of the scheme has actually transformed dry farms into highly productive farms.

In my six months as Infrastructure minister, I have grown very fond of wearing high-vis. In fact, I much prefer it to wearing the suits that I need to in this place.

Excitingly, the 2025-26 Budget represents another chapter in Tasmania's ambitious agenda to deliver a $30 billion pipeline of infrastructure projects over the next decade. The government is funding 20 per cent of this. A staggering 80 per cent of the $30 billion is from private investment. If we deliver key infrastructure, private enterprise has the confidence to build, grow, develop and create jobs.

Almost $1.6 billion will be invested in the state's roads and bridges over the next four years, delivering new and improved infrastructure while supporting jobs and boosting Tasmania's economy. We will invest $400 million over the next 12 months to progress projects on key freight routes and reduce travel times, getting Tasmanians home to their loved ones safer and sooner.

With the state's largest ever transport infrastructure project, the new Bridgewater Bridge, now largely complete and only one project to complete in the Midland Highway 10 Year Action Plan, we are moving on to what comes next: investment in all corners of the island. 

We are building big to support jobs, industry and the economy. New funding includes $34 million, jointly funded by the Australian Government, for upgrades to one of Tasmania's most important freight routes, the Ridgley Highway, which links the north-west and west coasts and is a corridor to mining, forestry and tourism industries.

This Budget continues our commitment to many major road and bridge upgrades which will benefit all Tasmanians. While there are too many to name in this short period of time, I will highlight a few of the major projects which will proceed as part of this Budget:

the start of the major multiyear program of improvements to the Arthur Highway;
ongoing major investments in the Bass Highway between Launceston and Devonport;
progressing plans for the Devonport to Cradle Mountain corridor;
upgrades to the East and West Tamar highways;
ongoing upgrades to Illawarra Road;
safety and efficiency improvements to the Ridgley, Murchison and Zeehan highways;
construction of the Northern Access Road, which will directly connect the Port of Hobart to our state's highway network and enable further activation of the broader Macquarie Point precinct;
further investment in the South East Traffic Solution between Hobart and Sorell, including the duplication of the Midway Point and Sorell causeways and the Tasman Highway; and
continuation of the Bass Highway projects between Wynyard and Marrawah.

I would also like to acknowledge several projects that are still awaiting Australian Government funding support, and they include:

Tamar River Bridge;
Brooker Highway upgrades; and
Wielangta Road upgrades.

We will continue to advocate to the federal government for co-investment in these projects, ensuring Tasmania receives its fair share. Federal minister Catherine King and I will meet in Canberra in coming months to discuss further joint projects, and I thank the minister, Ms King, for her ongoing support. We have a significant forward infrastructure plan which is continuing to provide confidence to the industry and create new jobs and investment in training and equipment. In addition to the many key projects, vital work continues on existing programs which include:

the Freight Capacity Upgrade Program;
the Tasman Highway (the Great Eastern Drive and Sideling); and
the Mornington area upgrades.

Corridor strategies are also progressing, which will confirm priority projects for development and delivery for future years, including the Huon and Lyell highways. These priorities are set based on needs and opportunities to improve road safety, as well as amenity and productivity. It has been pleasing to see the rigour and expertise involved in completing these corridor studies and the process by which they become real-world projects for the benefit of all Tasmanians.

The quality and upkeep of our roads is something which is regularly raised with me, and it is a priority. I am pleased the Budget continues the government's 25 per cent uplift to the road maintenance investment, ensuring we maintain the quality of our existing roads.

As a former mayor, I am deeply passionate about the local government sector, and ensure our councils are in the best position to support wellbeing, sustainability, and the prosperity of all Tasmanians. The Future of Local Government Review provided the government with a blueprint outlining what actions need to be taken in order to achieve this goal.

The government accepted 36 of the 37 recommendations and released our Priority Reform Program to guide the first suite of reforms. The Priority Reform Program is the culmination of three years' analysis and deep consultation with the community, developed in conjunction with the local government sector. It feels strange, after attending 20-plus of those meetings, to now be part of what is the implementation crew.

Since announcing our reform program, I can assure members it has been full steam ahead in delivering on these important reforms. Since December, the government has undertaken three statewide public consultations on proposed amendments to the Local Government Act; remaking of the local government meeting procedures and general regulations; and now a standalone Local Government Electoral Bill. Throughout this process I have been working closely with Dion Lester and Mick Tucker, from the Local Government Association of Tasmania, to ensure the sector is kept informed and involved as we work through our ambitious agenda. 

The proposed legislative changes play an important role in shaping a stronger, professional and resilient local government sector, ultimately creating a more resilient community. That is why these reforms matter and there will be more to come shortly. Our proposed amendments to the Local Government Act are aimed at supporting the government to do just that. We are planning to legislate new data reporting requirements for councils, which will allow far greater transparency for all the community. This includes minimum requirements for rate notices, ensuring Tasmanians can have confidence their council is delivering on what matters most.

I recognise the behaviour demonstrated by our local councillors has fallen well below the standards expected of elected representatives in recent times. They have asked for solutions. The government is proposing new serious councillor misconduct provisions which will be heard by TASCAT. The community is frustrated with the poor behaviour of some councillors and want to see it stamped out. A more respectful workplace produces more solid conversation and definitely stronger, more positive outcomes.

Additionally, we are providing the Director of Local Government with greater powers to require that a council engage the services of an independent adviser to provide guidance and support. I want to see councils getting back to basics and focus on doing core functions well, as is expected.

We are also progressing work on the new Local Government Electoral Bill. The bill will provide voters with a greater understanding of candidates, changes to eligibility criteria for candidates, and strengthen disclosure of donations. Additionally, the bill will allow for greater flexibility in the way local government elections are conducted. I look forward to working through the feedback provided and I intend to introduce the legislation to parliament later this year.

As part of the government's response to the Future of Local Government Review, a pathway for structural reform was also unveiled. I am really pleased several councils have approached government expressing an interest in exploring the benefits of reform. The Office of Local Government continues to support these councils in progressing their discussions and I look forward to seeing that work progress.

I think, across the Chamber, we can all agree that the Local Government Association of Tasmania bats well above its weight in the work they do. Not only does LGAT support councils, providing education, training and standardised policies; they support the government in important policy decision-making. I am pleased to see our government recognises their valuable input and has provided $300,000 to facilitate improved planning across the sector. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=13.5_D=8.8_C=0.82]  It also provides $500,000 to the Office of Local Government aimed at supporting the delivery of our priority reform program.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=24.4_D=15.0_C=0.76] I would like to thank all our councils, our peak bodies, LGAT and Local Government Professionals for the support provided to me, not only while I have been here as Minister for Local Government, but during my time in local government. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=40.6_D=3.1_C=0.90]  I know there is much more work to be done. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=45.7_D=6.0_C=0.86]  Change of this scale is challenging, but it is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=53.6_D=0.9_C=0.81]  Together [Bookmark: Phr7_O=55.2_D=24.8_C=0.87]  we are shaping a more adaptable, professional and efficient sector that the community can have absolute confidence in. I am proud to be on this journey with all my colleagues, stakeholders and constituents. I look forward to other members' contributions in this debate and I commend the Budget to the House. Thank you.

[12.01 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, I was hoping I would never have to speak about a budget that is so bad. I have been struggling to find the words to describe my despair. Anyone who has bothered to read the recent fiscal sustainability reports will not be surprised, but it comes as a bit of a shock [Bookmark: Phr11_O=133.0_D=1.0_C=0.90]  when it actually happens. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=135.8_D=26.9_C=0.83]  It is a bit like a loved one dying. No matter how prepared you are, it is still a shock. Our current situation is probably worse than the worst-case scenario in the 2021 Fiscal Sustainability Report. That is a Treasury document - not the Treasurer's document, a Treasury document.

The level of debt for this Budget year in the 2021 Fiscal Sustainability Report [Bookmark: Phr13_O=163.5_D=5.0_C=0.70]  is similar to the worst-case scenario for the same year in the 2021 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=168.8_D=3.5_C=0.81]  Fiscal Sustainability Report. We are at that point. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=173.5_D=18.2_C=0.84]  What makes this situation worse is that the interest rates are much higher than a few years ago, meaning the debt is accumulating much faster. It is quite obvious that the government has completely ignored past fiscal sustainability reports, as has the opposition for that matter.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=193.0_D=25.4_C=0.80] What the 2021 fiscal sustainability report had to say is as relevant today as it was back then and I will refer to a few paragraphs from page 33 of that Treasury report. It says:

Where high levels of Net Debt persist over the long-term, it can constrain fiscal flexibility due to the associated higher debt servicing payments. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=219.3_D=4.0_C=0.75]  This situation limits the government's ability to fund essential services. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=224.3_D=6.9_C=0.86]  It also limits a government's ability to respond to unforeseen events or to pursue other policy objectives. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=232.4_D=10.4_C=0.80] 

The results of the projections in this Report show that, if unchecked, the size of corrective action required to bring Net Debt under control could be very large. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=243.6_D=9.6_C=0.88]  For example, under the Historical Trends Scenario, if Net Debt is not addressed, it could grow to $20.4 billion by 2034-35. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=254.2_D=11.8_C=0.80] 

If measures taken to address the growth in debt are implemented in the short-term, the corrective action required will be less than if action is delayed.

For instance, by 2024-25 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=268.2_D=17.7_C=0.86] , revenue would need to be 4.5 per cent higher to achieve a zero Net Operating Balance under the Historical Trends Scenario. While this would be challenging, the size of the corrective action required is projected to increase significantly over time. [Bookmark: Phr23_O=286.8_D=12.6_C=0.86]  If no earlier corrective action is taken, by 2029-30, revenue would need to be 9.1 per cent higher to achieve a zero Net Operating Balance under the Historical Trends Scenario. [Bookmark: Phr24_O=301.0_D=3.9_C=0.76] 

The issue of intergenerational equity must also be considered in relation to managing debt. If debt is allowed to grow significantly over time, it will become an unreasonable burden for future generations. On the other hand, measures used to address the growth in debt should not unduly burden the current generation.
The corrective action taken to address Net Debt also needs to be balanced against the risks to the broader economy. If changes implemented to reduce debt, such as expenditure and taxation measures, are introduced without sufficient time for the community to adjust, or are undertaken during a period of economic weakness, it could lead to further economic and financial disruption. This could place strain on businesses and the community

However, if no corrective action is taken, higher levels of debt can increase borrowing costs and divert revenue that could otherwise have been used to provide services to the community. The demand for many of these services is expected to grow as the population ages.

That is a quote from the 2021 Fiscal Sustainability Report. Where are we? Potentially worse than where the worst scenario put us. When we looked at those reports in the PAC, it was, 'Oh well, the worst scenario is unlikely to happen because the government will do something.' No, they have not.

Nothing was done, which is why we are in this disastrous position we are today - it is disastrous. The worst-case scenario in the 2021 Fiscal Sustainability Report had interest for the general government sector at $268 million in 2028-29, the end of the forward estimates. This year, the 2025-26 Budget predicts interest on debt at $770 million in 2028-29, nearly three times the worst case in the fiscal sustainability report.

This is an absolute recipe for impending calamity. If people are not willing to see it, I do not know what we have got to do. Especially if this is the case of interest rates keep rising as lenders demand higher rates due to falling credit ratings, which is a very real risk.

Due to the windfall additions of the GST pool in 2025-26, our own-source revenue is now funding less than 30 per cent of expenses. Never has it been so low as a proportion - never. Yet, when you read the policy and parameter statement in budget paper 1, there is not a single dollar of increased revenue resulting from new policies.

When we go begging for a bailout - nothing is more certain than us needing a bailout somewhere in the near future - what is our response to the question? You have known about the problem for at least 10 years. Why have you not done something about it?

In real terms, spending on current operations is falling, despite all the talk about spending record amounts. In real terms, spending on current operations, delivery of services, is falling. Increasing debt servicing costs and paying for past liabilities is gradually leaving less and less to pay for ordinary operations - that is, delivery of services.

With regard to the fiscal strategy, I am not sure how the Treasurer assures himself that we are in a position that will see us return to any form of surplus in the foreseeable future. Two years ago, the government adopted a new fiscal strategy comprising 11 strategic actions and targets. I was filled with hope that at least there seemed to be a plan. Sadly, two years later, all but one or two of the targets are well out of reach and there is absolutely no plan for fixing them.

What is the point of setting targets with no plans to reach their targets? In fact, all those key indicators are going in the opposite direction. That is all outlined really clearly in budget paper 1, under the chapter Fiscal Strategy. One of the targets, number 9, relates to a framework for assessing large infrastructure projects more than $50 million in size, undertaken by government business enterprise and state-owned companies. It is essentially a benefit-cost measure. The target was to have a positive benefit-to-cost ratio; I think that was a typo. A positive benefit-cost ratio is hardly a worthy goal [Bookmark: Phr2_O=14.2_D=6.6_C=0.83] . If it was negative - like the opposite being negative - it would indicate negative benefits. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=22.5_D=3.4_C=0.64]  Surely, we would not approve a project that had negative benefits for the state. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=28.4_D=13.0_C=0.85]  I think what it was meant to say was the ratio should be greater than one, not simply a positive number; the government will perhaps have a look at that.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=42.5_D=5.3_C=0.91] This strategic target first appeared in the 2023-24 Budget with the following comment [Bookmark: Phr6_O=49.0_D=7.9_C=0.78] : 'Work on the development of this framework will commence in 2023-24.' [Bookmark: Phr7_O=58.1_D=3.8_C=0.91]  The next year, in 2024-25, the comment was [Bookmark: Phr8_O=62.8_D=23.2_C=0.84] , 'Work on the development of this framework is continuing and will be included in the 2025-26 Budget.' Oh well, I thought, only 365 more sleeps to wait to see the framework put into action. But then, in this year's budget papers, this wording appears: 'Measurement on this action will commence in 2025-26.' [Bookmark: Phr9_O=87.7_D=1.9_C=0.73]  Too hard? What is the problem?

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=90.5_D=22.2_C=0.83] This is the framework that would have been used to measure the worthiness of the stadium, for example. For two years we have been told they are working on it. Now we are told that work will start this financial year, starting in a month's time, roughly. It sounds a bit like Berth 3; I am staggered. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=114.1_D=5.6_C=0.75]  The whole point of measuring benefit-cost ratios is so that we can prioritise spending.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=121.0_D=18.6_C=0.90] The next challenge is to ensure benefits accrue in an equitable manner and hopefully some of the benefits can be captured in monetary form or by government so that the benefits can be spread more widely, providing a greater range of government services. If we are not doing this, the government is failing. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=140.6_D=10.4_C=0.76]  One of the problems of the government's fiscal strategy, comprising the 11 strategic targets, is that some overlap and others are in conflict with each other.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=152.0_D=21.9_C=0.72] I note the government has made some modest improvements, based on the recommendation from Saul Eslake, in abandoning the blunt efficiency dividends and improving economic analysis. That is a welcome change indeed, but the government's fiscal strategy remains fragmented, ineffective, and effectively meaningless with no plan to meet the targets.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=175.0_D=25.6_C=0.80] On a positive note, I will also welcome the inclusion of the estimated outcomes throughout the budget papers and for each line item, something I have asked for some time now. Some departments have been quite helpful in providing that; others have looked at me like I am from some second planet, but anyway, they are there for all to see now and it is helpful. I thank the government for doing that.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=201.9_D=19.3_C=0.78] However, back to the fiscal strategies. I note that the review, as mentioned by the Treasurer, will be taken of the fiscal strategies. This must be a genuine approach, not moving the goal posts, to try to meet one of the meaningful strategies in actions. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=222.6_D=17.2_C=0.83]  When we look at the suggested actions on pages 65 and 73 of budget paper 1, this is the fiscal strategy chapter, it reads in part:

The Government's commitments to ongoing and responsible Budget improvement are detailed in chapter 1 of this Budget Paper. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=241.2_D=11.4_C=0.77]  Measures relevant to Total General Government Sector Own-Source Revenue as a percentage of Total Expenditure include:

expenditure and service level reviews;
managing growth in public sector employment [Bookmark: Phr19_O=253.6_D=24.7_C=0.81] ;
driving public sector productivity; and
modernising expenditure decision making.

Noting that, according to the Treasurer, 'These measures are intended to improve this Fiscal Strategy Action as they are implemented through future Government policies and Budgets', however, for readers, the link between corrective measures and the strategic target is a little tenuous [Bookmark: Phr20_O=279.5_D=21.4_C=0.75] .

Strategic action 11, public sector efficiency, productivity and financial transparency, will be improved allegedly through 'continuation of saving measures from previous Budgets'. I am not sure we have seen those - it is a matter for next week, I am sure. 'Responding to Review and Inquiry recommendations' [Bookmark: Phr21_O=301.9_D=1.9_C=0.51]  - they have taken up some of the perhaps easier-to-adopt recommendations from Mr Eslake, and 'the establishment of an Efficiency and Productivity Unit'. Wow, that is encouraging.

Noting that the target is the target of those measures to fix our budget problem, this is what the target says in the budget papers:

Review to be undertaken in 2032-33 to assess the impact of action taken.

We will be in a world of pain by then if we do not do something more than this. I have little faith we are on any road to recovery here. The Treasurer can, of course, expect questions about this next week.

Noting the upcoming review that I mentioned, I note the fiscal strategy still includes 11 separate targets, many of which are quite vague, redundant or irrelevant. Only one is being met: that infrastructure investment exceeds depreciation. I would suggest that if we cannot meet that one, we may as well just turn the lights off.

There are no 10-year projections, no clear path to surplus, no structural reform. On the matter of redundant targets, take for instance the twin goal to run break-even fiscal balances in both the general government and the total state sectors. At first glance that is a commendable aim, when you think about it, but on close inspection, it is all a bit silly.

Achieving a surplus fiscal balance in the general government will heavily rely on dividends and income tax equivalents from government businesses, and also the receipt of capex grants intended to be passed to government businesses such as TasRail and Tasmanian Irrigation; but when the fiscal balance for the total state sector is calculated, all the internal transfers to and from the general government are eliminated. Hence, the fiscal balance in the total state sector will always be much lower. It is quite dumb to have identical targets for both. It just does not work that way.

This does bring us to the next issue: whilst all the talk about budgets and budget sustainability is about the general government, it would be totally remiss to overlook the rest of the total state sector, namely the government business enterprises and state-owned companies, of which Tasmania has a disproportionately high number compared to other states.

Any target for fiscal balance and net debt should arguably relate to the wider sector that includes these GBEs and SOCs, especially now with the proliferation of a form of the latter, with the likes of Macquarie Point Development Corporation, Stadiums Tasmania and Homes Tasmania. That is where we see net debt in the broader sector being twice that of the general government, where debt is increasing at a rate of $2.5 billion per annum, with little respite in sight. If there is any hint of a possible respite over the forward estimates, it is only because the government has been very selective about what it has included. 

Let me detail a few matters which caught my eye: the CPI is estimated to be higher than 2.5 per cent, which is the amount of wage increases the government is hopeful of securing. Is the government actually expecting nurses, teachers, police and others to accept real wage reductions? That is what that says.

The government has adopted a policy in recent years of including efficiency dividends in the budget as a bulk saving amount; an unallocated negative expense amount that sits in Finance-General. This amount has varied from $50 million to $150 million per annum. It is basically a lipstick-on-a-pig exercise designed to make the bottom line look better, so the government can continue to assert it is assiduously searching for the mythical pathway to surplus. As the years tick over, the unallocated amounts get allocated and become embedded in the budget. The policy and parameter statement tells us this; however, we never discover exactly what programs are impacted or who is monitoring the show. Are savings made or is it just a pretend exercise and wishful thinking? Again, we will have some questions next week about this.

Rebranding of projects and the budget efficiency dividend to the productivity and efficiency measure strongly suggests more lippy on the same pig. I will be keen to hear how the Treasurer explains this.

There are so many avenues for cost blowouts on upcoming infrastructure projects that it is hard to keep track. I have a mixture of concern and bemusement at the lack of contingencies, when seriously big infrastructure projects are tackled. The '$375 million, not a red cent more' will go down in folklore. Unfortunately, the way we all laughed at such a ridiculous claim that was meant seriously has trivialised budgeting for other projects. You can get away with saying it when it comes to estimating the cost of a project, but it has evolved to a situation where projects are commenced with too many unknowns and without adequate planning to deal with contingencies.

In the Public Accounts Committee's most recent hearing on the TT-Line's delivery of the berthing infrastructure in Devonport, the key message for the adults who are now in charge of the project was, 'Design, design, design, design, design, design, design, build.' What are we seeing with another major project around here? De-build. Agree to building it without all that really important work done. That is what we are being asked to do.

When we went to the Bridgewater Bridge the other day, one of the same people involved, the adults in the room delivering the Devonport berth now, talked about 'Design, design, design, design, design, design, design and build it,' for that beautiful bridge - it is lovely, but that was the message. That is the only way you do not throw good money after bad.
Increasingly and worryingly, public infrastructure plans are enthusiastic adoptees of moral hazard. 'The government will always pay' is the guiding principle, just get it approved in the first place. That appears to be happening in this Budget, whilst possible cost blowouts are disclosed for Berth 3, the Macquarie Point wastewater treatment plant, the North West Transmission Developments, and for Marinus, not to mention Mac Point itself, we find ourselves among fiscal volcanoes that may erupt at any moment because of the known unknowns. Some are sure to create havoc, particularly if you look at the recent form and history.

We need a better process for contingencies, or maybe just better planning or design at the outset. We are told there is a sensible path forward, but everywhere you look there are targets that are hopelessly underwater and no hints about fixing them. We are constantly told there is a strong plan for the future. I hate to say it, but the government is engaged in wilfully misleading deceit of the people of Tasmania.

There is no sensible path to surplus; we missed that boat years ago. The government turns a blind eye to unfavourable reports like fiscal sustainability reports and Saul Eslake's report on state finances. They even go one step further for reports like Nick Gruen's and call the dogs out to attack his professional integrity.

Ms O'Connor - It is shameful.

Ms FORREST - It is appalling. We are in a sad and sorry state. This Budget shows where these years of inaction have got us - into one hell of a mess. Almost past the point of no return. I say 'almost' because I am an optimist by nature.

What options are there? Borrow more? We tried that and it did not work. We cannot service the existing debt. Sell government businesses? At best, a sugar hit, but the next morning the feeling will be one big hangover. One-off debt reduction? They are a little pointless if we have not solved ongoing sustainability where spending exceeds receipts. Cut spending? That is the current plan, although it is not described in those terms exactly. The government is pretending it is not pursuing austerity, but it is. Amounts spent on current operations in real terms is falling. Ipso facto, it is austerity.

Is it what people are demanding? Are they asking for this hysteria - asking for cuts? Not to my knowledge. Raise more in own-source revenue? The government wants to but is not prepared to do anything about it. They say they want to do something, but then do nothing. Income from government businesses is under stress and the policy and parameters statement in the Budget reveals just that and new streams are ruled out. Yet, without more of our-own source revenue, we are doomed to further austerity. Whether it is raising more in taxes or more in charges for goods and services via government and government businesses, it is one and the same from an economic impact viewpoint. Whatever is done, however, must be done equitably.

To rule anything out is dumb public policy. State governments, as with local governments, are like households, they face the same budget constraints. The federal government is uniquely placed in the system. It has control over the creation of money. They are not the same as the state. The federal government has outsourced most money creation to private banks. Banks create money by making loans. The federal government creates money by spending. Most money is created by the former, contrary to popular opinion. That is - banks create money to make loans.
We need a rebalancing of our economy where banks create less by making fewer loans - which basically keeps inflating residential property markets, which keeps banks profitable - and the federal government creates more by spending, specifically giving infrastructure grants to state governments to help keep state borrowings lower and enable states to devote more of their revenues to providing much-needed services at a state level. That is the role of the federal government in terms of its interaction with the state.

The reform of state finances can be done, but it will need a lot of cross-party support, which is sadly absent from this much of the current debate. It is something that has to be done at the federal level. It is not something we can do in isolation. Surely it would be better for us if we can engage with the federal government on this rather than have them come in over the top of us and impose measures on the state that may not be what we would have chosen, if we were able to take responsibility and get our own house in order to fully participate in such a discussion. We must work with the federal government on federal-state financial relations in a proactive and meaningful way. It is not something we can do alone. We are past that point.

I am going to reiterate some of the facts and restate some of my concerns related to this Budget and what we are required to consider here this week and next. When we look to the general government sector, the core of public service delivery, it is projected to run net operating deficits totalling $3.5 billion over the next four years. That is $1.5 billion worse than the government's own projections just four months ago in the revised estimates report, and it is $1.8 billion worse than last year's Budget. They are horrifying figures. The true picture is even more alarming. When we exclude one-off federal capital grants, which artificially inflate the revenue side, the underlying net operating deficit rises to $5.3 billion through 2027-28, with a further $582 million deficit forecast for 2028-29.

These are not temporary imbalances. These are structural shortfalls, the result of persistent overspending and an unwillingness to make hard fiscal choices. An unwillingness to admit reality or, it seems, to understand what this Budget truly does. This is unconscionable, especially whilst at the same time blithely assuring us that we are on a path to surplus.

If you look at the cash deficits and debt, it could almost be described as a ticking time bomb. The government's cash position is deteriorating even faster. Over the next four years, Tasmania will run cash deficits of $5.1 billion, with another $498 million in 2028-29. These deficits are not being driven by investment in future productivity. They are being driven by operating shortfalls, cost overruns and servicing of past liabilities.

As a result, net debt is forecast to reach $10.2 billion by June 2028, and $10.8 billion by June 2029. That is $1.6 billion more than projected just a year ago. Not only do these projections not include a number of key known and costly risks to government expenditure [Bookmark: Phr2_O=15.6_D=3.7_C=0.68] , but they are bad enough without that. If you add in some of those known risks [Bookmark: Phr3_O=21.1_D=1.1_C=0.85] , it is even worse [Bookmark: Phr4_O=24.0_D=15.5_C=0.81] . Let us be clear, this debt is not being used to build a stronger Tasmania, as much as the government might keep repeating it. It is a fallacy. It is being used to plug holes in the operating budget, a dangerous and unsustainable practice.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=40.9_D=26.3_C=0.80] This Budget is based on unrealistic assumptions, with the Budget's projections relying on what could be called heroic and unfounded. In fact chief of these assumptions is that the operating expenses will grow by just 0.3 per cent per annum over the next four years. It would be the lowest rate in modern Tasmanian history. It is a pure fantasy. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=69.1_D=3.1_C=0.79]  The assumption flies in the face of recent experience. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=72.4_D=23.9_C=0.84]  Over the past four years, the government has incurred $2.5 billion in cost overruns, including $1.3 billion in Health, $285 million in interest expenses and $271 million in State Growth, just those alone. If the government could not control costs in the past, why would we even believe they could do it now?

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=98.3_D=8.7_C=0.81] This Budget relies on misleading comparisons as well, to convince us, or try to convince us, that Tasmania's true position is not as bad as others'. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=107.9_D=8.2_C=0.74]  The budget papers attempt to reassure us by comparing Tasmania's debt levels with other states, but these comparisons are misleading [Bookmark: Phr10_O=117.9_D=20.0_C=0.77]  and some would say dishonest. Yes, Tasmania has the lowest nominal net debt, but we also have the second-smallest economy and population. When we account for our own unfunded superannuation liability and the debt of our non-financial corporations, that is our GBEs and SOCs [Bookmark: Phr11_O=138.3_D=6.4_C=0.85]  and other entities, Tasmania's net financial liabilities are the worst in the nation [Bookmark: Phr12_O=145.7_D=9.0_C=0.86] . In fact, over the next four years Tasmania will have the largest cash deficits and net financial liabilities of any state or territory. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=156.3_D=9.7_C=0.76]  That is the reality, no matter how these numbers are spun. I urge the government to cease misleading the people of Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=167.2_D=29.7_C=0.85] When we consider the economic outlook, the best we can say is built on very fragile and shaky foundations. The Budget assumes the Tasmanian economy will grow by 1.5 per cent per annum in 2025-26 and 2026-27, returning to 2.5 per cent thereafter. But are these forecasts realistic or are they resting on shaky ground too? Business investments are expected to decline in the near term. Employment has fallen by 1.7 per cent [Bookmark: Phr15_O=197.0_D=10.8_C=0.74]  over two years, while national employment has grown by 4.8 per cent; labour force participation has dropped to 60.4 per cent compared to 67 per cent nationally. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=208.8_D=5.1_C=0.77]  Population growth assumptions are optimistic, with state forecasts double that of the federal treasury.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=216.1_D=23.9_C=0.81] These are not the hallmarks of a resilient economy, they are signs of stagnation, the foundation and grounds on which the economic outlook are very shaky indeed. Where do we go from here? What can we do with the state? First, we must acknowledge reality. Tasmania is not on a path to surplus. We are on a path to deeper debt and diminished fiscal [Bookmark: Phr18_O=240.9_D=4.3_C=0.91]  capacity. Second, we must make hard choices. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=245.7_D=11.7_C=0.82]  This means reprioritising spending. It is clear not all programs can be preserved. Exploring new revenue sources, including fair and efficient taxation, but not in isolation. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=258.2_D=11.3_C=0.70]  These are not one-off things. We need to look at the whole picture, improving public sector productivity through targeted reforms, not across-the-board cuts [Bookmark: Phr21_O=270.8_D=12.4_C=0.71] ; and, third, we must rebuild trust.

There is a massive trust deficit in this government because they are not open and transparent about this. They are pretending it is all tickety-boo [Bookmark: Phr22_O=284.4_D=20.5_C=0.79] . What this means is transparent reporting, honest reporting, realistic assumptions and a willingness to confront uncomfortable truths. I have spent my time in here in parliament always seeking the advice and expertise of those far more knowledgeable and experienced than me in the areas that I am not proficient at. I have been doing that since I entered parliament in 2005.

With matters related to the state budget and our financial position, this was very new territory for me 20 years ago. I have worked really hard to fully understand these critical areas of our responsibility as elected members. I have relied on the expertise of career economists and accountants to assist me in this task. At times I have been quite the remedial student. For close to 10 years now - and probably a bit longer when I look back - I have been speaking out and warning of the need for actual and meaningful responses to the state's financial position.

It has not been just me saying this, particularly of late. Treasury, in the last two fiscal sustainability reports, has provided clear warnings of the need for remedial action. Years ago, to avoid the position we now find ourselves in, economists including Saul Eslake have been saying the same things that I have, with a growing sense of urgency.

Still, the government does nothing to correct our trajectory. This government has done nothing to address the known problems in any meaningful way since they came to power in 2014. In fact, it is solely the result of their policy decisions, not parameter changes, that we are now in this position. Saul Eslake has made that very clear in his commentary on this matter.

It is this government who has led us to the brink and still does not have a plan, despite the rubbish and rhetoric that continues to issue forth from the Treasurer and his other Cabinet colleagues. It is inexcusable to not have the courage to admit the situation. Ignorance is no excuse, as there are many experts out there, and others who are not experts, such as myself, who have been warning of this for years.

The 2025-26 Tasmanian State Budget is not a road map to recovery. There is no credible path to surplus, however described, and there is no sign of any plan to create or deliver a surplus. This Budget is yet another warning sign, a red flag waving over a deepening fiscal chasm.

Despite the Treasurer's confident rhetoric and the Premier's today - I was watching it in Question Time this morning - this Budget does not deliver a credible path to surplus. It delivers a continuation of structural deficits, rising debt and a growing disconnect between spending ambitions and revenue realities. The forward Estimates are fanciful and mere illusions with many known risks that will absolutely impact the Budget referred to in the commentary but not accounted for.

The forward Estimates show optimistic increases in the profitability of Hydro Tasmania in 2028-29. If you want to look at it, it is page 141 of budget paper No. 1. The explanation of this is due to expected returns to normal rainfall. It is almost double the amount the year before. Who provided that advice? That is not a question you need to answer. I hope someone else can next week. They are basing this significant uptick in profitability of Hydro through dividends and income tax equivalents in 2028-29, and all I could find - the only explanation I could find in this budget paper here, was an expected return to 'normal rainfall', whatever the hell that is at the moment in the climate change that we are experiencing. There is no credible evidence that this will be the case, and if their long-range forecast is that good, I am sure every farmer would be pleased to have it.

Furthermore, given Treasury estimates that CPI will be 3.3 per cent in 2024-25 and 2.75 per cent in 2025-26, why does the government expect to be able to wait to negotiate a wage agreement, or any wage agreements, at 2.5 per cent? It is another well-understood risk that has not been factored in. Effectively, as I said earlier, what this is saying is there is an expectation that nurses, doctors, police, teachers, et cetera, will agree to real reductions in wages. That is going to make it easy for us to recruit them, is it not, or to keep them?

I say that whilst also noting that the government is making a virtue - that is, claiming credit for recent high wage growth. The wage price index is 3.5 per cent. You cannot have it both ways in any credible way here.

Another absolute reality is the rising cost of self-insurance through the Tasmanian Risk Management Fund, which has been funded through agency contributions and continues to be. However, this year, for the first time in my memory, there is a $127 million appropriation to cover expected cost just for this year.

Budget paper 2, Volume 1 on page 77 informs us that the appropriation in 2025-26 'represents funding to reflect actuarial analysis regarding increasing liabilities relating to workers compensation', and that the 'funding will ensure the Fund has a sufficient level of financial assets to meet outstanding claims liabilities in relation to this risk category'. It goes on to say:

The increase in the Tasmanian Risk Management Fund expenses primarily reflects the latest actuarial advice for changes in potential claim estimates, in particular personal injury claims.

We are likely to see even more personal injury claims if the staff cuts and pressure exerted on workers and negative wage growth to people like health workers and teachers continue. There will be more workers compensation claims, not less. These essential workers are already working as hard as they can to meet the needs of Tasmanians, and it is not simply a matter of asking teachers and nurses, for example, to be more efficient. Nurses can only look after a certain number of patients, depending on the acuity of the patient. Teachers can only teach a certain number of students.

Other known risks include - and these are risks we know are going to have an impact, but they are not factored into the forward Estimates, which are fanciful. These risks include the highly likely bailout needed to enable TT-Line to deliver the new ferries and berth in Devonport - highly likely; the enormous financial risk to the state of Marinus Link and the associated North West Transmission Development; likely cost escalations associated with the relocation of the Macquarie Point Wastewater Treatment Plant - we have signed up for that, sharing the cost escalations with TasWater; the northern access road to support the Hobart Port and proposed stadium; funding for Stadiums Tasmania; Treasury Future Accommodation - that is not included; how much that is going to cost if we sell the Treasury building, they did tell us last year they were not going to when asked directly in budget Estimates; health demand cost; and claims for compensation for survivors of institutional sexual abuse are just some of the risks that we know are there but are not factored in.

I have not even focused on the enormous financial risk that the proposed Macquarie Point stadium poses to this Budget and the forward Estimates. This warranted a full page in the risk section of the budget papers, the final paragraph stating after laying out the risk to the Budget, that as with any large infrastructure project, the Macquarie Point Multipurpose Stadium and the wider Macquarie Point Urban Renewal Project are subject to the same ongoing procurement, supply and cost risk that other major projects have experienced and therefore need to be carefully managed, even though we are told there is a significant contingency baked in. When I go back to my comment about design, design, design, design, design, design, design, design before you build - the risks are everywhere.

We also know the state has to fund any cost overruns related to the Australian Antarctic Division, Macquarie Wharf 6 Project, and to fund the shore power, refuelling and the life cycle and maintenance costs of the infrastructure. This is not something we might have to do, this is something we have signed up to do. It is another thing. We know it is almost a certainty that the cost will blow out.

These costs, known and/or assumed, are not included in the forward Estimates. They are identified as risks. The Treasurer has chosen to include the $150 million Efficiency and Productivity Unit savings as a certainty, making the picture look just a little bit more positive in those two out-years.

It is simply misleading to only include possible positive impacts and assume they will be delivered - including higher returns from Hydro, as I mentioned earlier - and not include no negatives that are clearly outlined in Chapter 4, the Risks and Sensitivities chapter in budget paper 1.

With all this considered, and noting the warnings given by two Treasury fiscal sustainability reports, it is clear the forward Estimates will be even worse than projected and disastrous without real and meaningful action.

Tragically, the government have let it come to this. They have had 11 years to take corrective action, and they have failed. Tasmania has faced financial crises before and we have overcome them, but only when we face facts, make tough decisions and put the long-term interests of the state ahead of short-term political convenience and populist decision-making. We need to have an inclusive conversation about the future of the state. Wantonly continuing to ignore all the warnings and seeking to mislead the public with patently false productivities is disgraceful. This Budget does not face facts. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=23.1_D=1.3_C=0.94]  It does not make tough decisions [Bookmark: Phr3_O=25.5_D=27.0_C=0.71]  and it puts the long-term interest of the state ahead of short-term political convenience and takes a blinkered singular focus on delivering a project that has divided the state in clear sight of failures such as the berth 3 in Devonport and the massive cost escalation that has created to name but one stuff-up to the financial detriment of our capacity to deliver services. This is unacceptable.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=53.7_D=29.4_C=0.80] I have always held the view that the government have a right and duty to bring down a budget to deliver Tasmanian services, infrastructure and a vision for the future. In the absence of illegal borrowings or gross malfeasance, I have always held that it is up to the government to provide services, infrastructure and a vision for the future, even if I prefer to see some other priorities at the margins. I have sought to scrutinise the budget and hold the government of the day to account, both in  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=83.4_D=7.4_C=0.74] the Chamber and in my work on the PAC, to ensure we know how public money is being spent, on what and for what outcome.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=91.3_D=8.1_C=0.89] This is my first time in 20 years where I have asked myself, can I in all good conscience actually support this Budget? [Bookmark: Phr7_O=100.3_D=29.1_C=0.84]  This Budget defers the reckoning, it delays the repair and it denies the depth of the challenge. It is the government with its head in the sand and/or lacking the financial literacy or wherewithal to face reality. We can do better. We must do better for the sake of our economy and services and future generations of Tasmanians. I am deeply concerned. I only intend to speak on the actual Budget. There are many other things that I could discuss [Bookmark: Phr8_O=130.1_D=29.6_C=0.80]  and I will use other opportunities to do so, but it is such a serious situation we are facing that I have focused my entire contribution on this because the government is in complete denial and continues to mislead the people of Tasmania with their rhetoric and dishonest claim that they are on a pathway to surplus.

These are matters I will follow up next week, but I am deeply [Bookmark: Phr9_O=159.9_D=8.6_C=0.77]  concerned. It is the worst budget I have ever seen and I did not think we would get here despite the warnings, but here we are. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=169.2_D=1.3_C=0.66]  I note the Budget.

[12.48 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre) -  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=171.8_D=9.5_C=0.71]  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=187.0_D=1.4_C=0.84]  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=189.5_D=26.4_C=0.82] Mr President, I could not let the debate go straight through. Otherwise, there would be a few members looking for how they can provide a contribution in some other way. I acknowledge the contribution by the member for Murchison. When it comes to the state's finances, it is no secret that the member for Murchison [Bookmark: Phr14_O=216.7_D=2.6_C=0.83]  does - and has for many, many years [Bookmark: Phr15_O=220.1_D=24.9_C=0.85]  - have a very strong handle on what is being presented.

Before I start, I did not take the opportunity to acknowledge the re-election of the member for Nelson at an earlier time. I did not want to cut into my five minutes of special interest matter, but I think most of us were not surprised by the re-election of the member for Nelson, equal to the member for Pembroke, on their fine re-elections to this place. I would also like to acknowledge the newest member of the House, the member for Montgomery, taking over from his parent.

A little bit of advice that was provided to me - because when you take over and win the confidence of your community as you have done very recently [Bookmark: Phr18_O=281.0_D=0.5_C=0.92]  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=282.1_D=22.8_C=0.77] , I did that 21 years ago when my father was the previous member and I said, 'They are big shoes to fill'; and someone said, 'No, you walk in your own shoes. You do not try to walk in somebody else's.' Just a little bit of advice from your colleague and I am happy to answer any questions that you might have across your journey. Welcome and all the very best.

Back to the Budget: there was a conversation at an earlier time this morning when a committee joined and we were waiting for a member to join us before we started. I have no finance background; I have said that in this place many times.

My philosophy when it comes to a budget for my own personal household, and previously, is I have x amount of dollars and when I run out, that is it. And I still like to use cash because I think cash is king, not all these card transactions, but when I run out of money in my wallet, that was it. I would tell my children, 'There is no more money.' That is the simple basis of my understanding of finances. 

To be presented with budget papers - and for anyone who has seen them, there are three and they are significantly thick budget papers - and you are expected to have a pretty good understanding of what is presented, and then come back into this place on a Tuesday - quite a few of us have significant travel times in between receiving those budget papers. We had the discussion - you almost need that week between receiving your budget papers, a free week, and then the opportunity to come back into this place and talk about what you have learned. 

Now, I have no idea whether the government of the day would be interested in taking up that suggestion, but from an independent who has the assistance of no-one other than my office staff - who look after my office brilliantly - the people, the constituents, the general day-to-day workings of an office - but when it comes to reading budget papers, and to be perfectly honest, in the past, I have attempted to have some expert advice, if you like, come back to me. But by the time you get budget papers to somebody, whatever that looks like, and then you receive some feedback - here we are, it is Tuesday morning and we are launching forward with our response to the budget. 

Perhaps the Acting Leader might take on board that it is quite a challenge to be able to do what is expected of us. Even if you had someone who was an expert in finances and the like - and obviously, I am like most members I expect, I go onto the media outlets and I have a look at some of the experts that have provided some input, and I have a couple of those here and I will refer to some of those as I make my way through my contribution, but again, that is a more generalised approach. So, if you had a person that you could continue to rely on and have at your access, then I feel that that would be - well, I would expect that my contribution would be much more thorough, but I will do my best to work my way through what has been presented to us.

It is very clear that the expenditure for the Budget - and there is a table that has been provided, and I think there is a wheel that usually has the different numbers of the pie chart, if you like, for the Budget. 

Health, 34 per cent of the Budget; education, 23 per cent of Tasmania's Budget; public order, 9 per cent; social protection, 7 per cent; housing, 2 per cent; transport, 5 per cent; and other, 20 per cent, and you know that the 'other' is a significant number of services that are requested of a government of the day. That tells you that there is not much left over. How a government deals with the magnitude of requests, an enormous role - how do you tell a service provider, community organisation or a school, a health facility or a community, 'Your project did not make the cut, your request for funding did not make the cut?'

I have no idea how the budget process works, but I expect that there is a lot of negotiation that takes place, a lot of negotiation. 'You get this, we get this, you have that, we have this.' How you make that fit into a small state's economy relies heavily on the Commonwealth and the people working across our state. I will get to that a little bit later, because there have been some suggestions by the member for Murchison on how to balance the budget.

I do not envy any government. I have been here 21 years now and they do not get any easier. We all have those community groups, organisations and those members in our community who cannot access a service that they believe they are entitled to, and sometimes they want it on their back doorstep. They do not want to have to travel anywhere for it, for whatever reason, and there is an expectation that the government will provide it, an enormous task.

I have no particular order for what I have before me in my contribution, but I did go and have a look at a couple of previous contributions that I have made. It appears that a lot of the matters in my area that I represent remain of general concern. They are the key ones. I know that the government of the day cannot and is not in a position to access and to address all of those particular areas.

One that comes to mind, particularly in this time, is access to reliable and affordable telecommunications for all residents in our state. I know what a difficult challenge that is, as the member for McIntyre, even driving out of Launceston, about 5 kilometres out, if you are taking a call, it finishes. Then you have to wait until you get to Nunamara, where you may be able to pick it up quickly, but then you lose it again. The time efficiency in this day and age continues to be a real challenge for a lot of people who move in and out of the McIntyre electorate.

I would like to relay an opportunity that was a real winner for the Cressy area. A terrific fencing contractor, Richard Duncan, who lived in the area and worked out in more rural and remote areas, had no phone service and he worked on his own. It was really important to have phone service. He worked so hard through the Northern Midlands Business Association to have that organisation support an upgrade to the telecommunications around the Cressy area. To the credit of this state government -

QUESTIONS

Macquarie Point Stadium Plan - Cricket Australia Contribution

Ms THOMAS question to ACTING LEADER of the GOVERNMENT in the LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Ms PALMER

[2.31 p.m.]
We have heard various estimations on the cost of the Macquarie Point Stadium, ranging from $750 million to $1.5 billion, and most recently $945 million. Your government has stated that the cost to the Tasmanian taxpayer will be $375 million plus borrowings, with contributions of $15 million from the AFL and $245 million from the federal government for the Macquarie Point precinct, provided that federal funding agreement conditions are met.

My understanding is the stadium has been designed in conjunction with Cricket Australia to precisely cater for international and domestic cricket matches with media boxes, functions bases, corporate hospitality areas and practice wickets specified according to the requirements of Cricket Australia. However, Cricket Australia and the ICC have declared the current roof design would lead to unacceptable playing conditions for any form of cricket played in daylight and a total redesign is required if the stadium is to be used for cricket.

My questions are:

Considering the stadium is being designed to cater for the needs of cricket, further changes to the roof design are likely to add to the cost and that cricket is expected to be an anchor tenant, together with the AFL. Has the government asked Cricket Australia for a contribution toward the stadium cost?

If not, will the government ask Cricket Australia to contribute to the cost of the stadium to reduce the cost to the Tasmanian taxpayer?

ANSWER

Mr President, the multipurpose stadium is being designed to support a broad range of users and this includes cricket.

The Macquarie Point Development Corporation has been working closely with future users of the stadium to ensure the facility will be delivery-ready and include all fixed items necessary for its operation from day one.

The total cost of the multipurpose stadium is estimated to be $945 million, including improvements that will enhance the stadium user experience by catering for a wide range of planned uses, including helping to facilitate cricket at the venue. It also accounts for detailed items such as audiovisual, communications, kitchen and food and beverage fit-outs.

By investing in these additional elements, we are ensuring that the stadium can host a broad array of events and experiences and provide a high-quality visitor experience that makes the stadium sustainable to operate.

The government has met with both Cricket Tasmania and Cricket Australia to discuss the stadium and those discussions are continuing. The government is aware that they have expressed concerns regarding potential shadows cast from the structural beams required to support the enclosed stadium roof.

We are confident that a solution can be achieved that will see all forms of cricket being able to be played at the venue. Recent public comments from Cricket Tasmania CEO Dominic Baker reflect the goodwill of all parties to work through the remaining issues for cricket regarding the stadium design. 

Cricket has advised that, should the stadium design prove suitable, a range of cricket fixtures can be played at the stadium, including international fixtures. Scheduling attractive cricket content at the stadium, including fixtures that provide international exposure for Tasmania, will improve the viability of the venue and the return to the people of Tasmania.

If the enabling legislation for the stadium is approved, the government will continue to engage with all parties throughout the design and construction process to ensure we deliver on the multipurpose nature of the stadium.

Stadiums Tasmania is delivering a ground user occupancy agreement which will include securing content from not only the AFL, but also Cricket Tasmania and Cricket Australia. It is my understanding that, historically, Cricket Australia does not provide funding for stadia infrastructure. When it comes to funding, I am advised that CA provides funding through its Australian Cricket Infrastructure Funding Program. The ACIF will provide $5 million in the 2024-25 season into community infrastructure projects.


Education - Federal Funding to Schools and Individual Students

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.0_D=4.8_C=0.69] Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[2.35 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=35.1_D=24.8_C=0.82] According to the state budget papers, Tasmania is now receiving the allocated federal funding as calculated according to the School Resourcing Standard. Are you able to outlay how the funding is being allocated to schools and to individual students to ensure equity relative to need [Bookmark: Phr4_O=61.1_D=3.0_C=0.73] , and where schools and students most needing support [Bookmark: Phr5_O=64.6_D=15.3_C=0.78]  are suitably funded? This question in part is designed to respond to some concerns that have been raised by stakeholders about fairer funding being allocated towards departmental priorities rather than into schools.

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=83.0_D=1.9_C=0.72]  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=131.9_D=28.9_C=0.86] Mr President, it was fantastic to be able to sign up with the Commonwealth government mid-last year to secure a better funding agreement, taking Tasmanian schools up to the full 100 per cent of funding, and with that came the federal government's commitment to [Bookmark: Phr8_O=161.6_D=15.4_C=0.89] , at that stage, take it up to the 2.5 per cent, and now there has been that additional commitment from the Commonwealth government to take it up to 5 per cent. 

It is important to remember that that additional funding is attached to reforms [Bookmark: Phr9_O=177.5_D=9.1_C=0.86] , and they are reforms that we must report against. Those reforms are covering workforce; it covers [Bookmark: Phr10_O=188.4_D=1.5_C=0.78]  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=196.7_D=26.2_C=0.87]  equity and excellence and wellbeing. The way that we allocate that funding has to be tied to those reforms and we have to report against that. I believe it is six-monthly that we have to report to the Commonwealth about that funding. There has been some narrative surrounding that extra funding that has come in, and how that will be distributed to schools.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=223.6_D=9.5_C=0.71] It would have been a great scenario to be able to say, all right, this many schools, this many students, we can divvy that funding up and get it into schools. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=233.6_D=16.2_C=0.87]  The issue would then be that it would be the responsibility, possibly of the principals and the schools, to have to report against those reforms. If there is one thing that I have heard very, very clearly from principals and teachers, but in particular our principals [Bookmark: Phr14_O=249.9_D=28.6_C=0.83] , it is the workload that already sits on them, especially in that administration space. 

I visited some schools where principals have said they would love to be out talking to teachers and working on professional development with their teachers, but instead they find themselves in their offices working in that admin space. We had to find a way that there was a really good balance, so the responsibility of reporting against those reforms would sit with the department [Bookmark: Phr15_O=278.9_D=26.0_C=0.85]  and ultimately with me, and how do we also get that funding into schools. A great example of this is the work that we are doing with the announcement that we have made of the $12 million for Lifting Literacy resources. 

Again, the voice of teachers really came into this space, and it was very much, if we are going to provide wonderful opportunities for teachers to go and do professional learning, let us make sure that the schools are properly resourced to be able to pay for the relief teaching. That is part of that $12 million reform.

We will be paying for subscriptions to IT professional development, and where schools have in some cases already invested - say New Flight or Word Origin - we will reimburse them. It is decodable readers into schools. It is book sets going into classrooms. We have made sure that we are getting that money into schools, that it is tied to the areas of the reform, the three reform pillars that we have to report against. It is ensuring that that money is getting into schools, but then the onus will not be on schools to actually have that heavy administrative burden of having to report against those pillars.


Education - Funding for Disadvantaged Students

Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[2.41 p.m.]
Thank you for your answer, minister. So, just for clarity, the original Gonski reforms were intended to target disadvantage and were intended, as I recall, to be tailored to individual student needs with a specific focus on disadvantage.

Are you saying that lens where government or the department would look at areas where schools need extra investment is not being applied? If not, can you explain how it is being applied? How is this extra funding going to support, for example, an individual kid who is behind educationally and needs extra support?

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the member for the question. The school resourcing package is already calculated around any disadvantage of the students that are in those particular schools. That is already taken into account through that funding model. I think one of the greatest things that we can do for any child in any school is certainly in that literacy space, and to ensure that we are resourcing our teachers, who are already doing an exceptional job, in the structured teaching of literacy to ensure that they have the resources that will absolutely help them to continue doing the amazing work that they are doing. 

I think that is one of the best things that we can do for any child, regardless of their background or the circumstances they find themselves in, to ensure that they are not left behind and that we see every child - leaving primary school, leaving high school, leaving year 12 - fluent in their reading, which is why the pillar of the new funding that is coming from the Commonwealth, absolutely the bulk of it for this year is being invested into literacy. The CRP is calculated on the needs of a school.


Pioneer Lake - Access

Ms RATTRAY question to MINISTER for PARKS, Mr DUIGAN

[2.44 p.m.]
As you are well aware, Pioneer Lake has served as an accessible and affordable destination for locals and visitors alike for many years. I understand that there is a recent engineering report in regard to the Pioneer Lake.

I am interested on behalf of a lot of people who make contact regularly, can we have an update on the current situation with accessible and affordable access to Pioneer Lake? I acknowledge that it is heading well into winter and we might not be camping as much, but they are already thinking about the summer.

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the member for the question and particular interest in Pioneer Lake. It is part of your patch and an important recreational asset in that part of the world. I have been up to Pioneer to have a look at Pioneer Lake and the camping facilities and the dam which has given us this issue. We have seen the water spilling through the dam and are somewhat sceptical of the dam that has been there for a long period of time needing to be deactivated, but, having seen the water pouring through that dam, I can understand some of the concerns. I am advised that subject to contractors being available to commence the work, we are expecting that work to commence in July.

Ms Rattray - Ready for the summer season?

Mr DUIGAN - Ready for the summer season. There is access available around the other side of Pioneer Lake.


PFAS Chemicals - Controls

Ms FORREST question to ACTING LEADER of the GOVERNMENT in the LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Ms PALMER

[2.47 p.m.]
With regard to new Commonwealth controls due to come into effect as of 1 July 2025 for particular subsets of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) or 'forever' chemicals intentionally added to packaging and products:

Will the government have the required legislation in place by 1 July, and if not, why not?

Will the proposed national PFAS ban include all PFAS products available to purchase by consumers, including all the relevant air conditioner/refrigerant gases, cookware utensils and all pharmaceuticals, as well as food packaging, firefighting and waterproofing products, and if not, why not?

What impact on the budget will implementing these controls have on Tasmanians?

Will the national ban include all PFAS pesticides? If not, why not?

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the member for the question.

Australian and New Zealand jurisdictions, including Tasmania, have been collaborating since 2017 on the per- and poly-fluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) National Environmental Management Plan to ensure nationally consistent approach to managing the environmental risks of PFAS is in force.

More recently, the Tasmanian government has committed, through the Environment Ministers' Meeting, to incorporate the Industrial Chemicals Environmental Management Standard (IChEMS) register into its regulatory framework under the Environmental Management and Pollution Control Act 1994. The Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania is currently undertaking policy work to support adoption of the register as soon as practically possible. In the meantime, the Environment Protection Authority Tasmania will continue to support, monitor and enforce compliance with existing requirements for management of industrial chemicals according to risk.

The register can be viewed on the Australian Government's Department of Climate Change, Energy and the Environment website at https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/protection/chemicals-management/national-standard/ichems-online-register.

The most prevalent PFAS found in the Australian environment and population to date have been perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS).

PFAS have never been manufactured in Australia and the use and import of products containing PFOA, PFOS and PFHxS have reduced significantly in the last 20 years. Today, the importation of PFOA, PFOS and PFHxS has been almost entirely phased out.

As of 1 July 2025, the importation of PFOA, PFOS and PFHxS to Australia will be prohibited, with limited exceptions such as for research or laboratory purposes. The ban will not apply if the chemicals are unintentionally present in products at low levels.

The IChEMS register sets out prohibitions where scheduled PFAS (either by itself or contained in a mixture, or in an article) is imported, exported, manufactured or used.

As you can see from the register, most of the items that are prohibited or restricted relate to firefighting foams and flame retardants. It is likely that products have already used, or will shortly be using, alternative ingredients and there will be limited impact.

Exemptions are available if the presence of PFAS is only as an unintentional trace contaminant at certain defined levels of concentration stated in Schedule 7.

Other exemptions apply where the PFAS is for research or laboratory purposes, imported under a hazardous waste permit, or where the PFAS is an article that was in use on or before 1 July 2025.

NRE Tasmania is currently undertaking policy work to support adoption of the IChEMS register. Budgetary impacts will be assessed through the process; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on consumers of general products. The work being undertaken to recognise the register is being managed within existing departmental resources.

This is a matter for the Australian Government. Should a national ban be progressed, jurisdictions will be consulted.


Tasman Bridge - Traffic Flow - Lane Changes

Mr EDMUNDS question to ACTING LEADER of the GOVERNMENT in the LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Ms PALMER

[2.53 p.m.]
My question is number 13 from the Notice Paper from March this year. I note Pulse Tasmania news was able to get an answer to this question in about 30 minutes when they asked it, but this is my first chance to ask and there may be other detail in the answer when it is given.

Ms Rattray - That is impressive.

Mr EDMUNDS - Yes, it says a lot for the state of new media.

A number of eastern shore residents have expressed concern with the scheduling of the change of traffic flow on the Tasman Bridge in the mornings when the fifth lane changes from inbound to outbound.

Is there a mechanism to delay the change in lanes and traffic flow from 9.00 a.m. on days when traffic coming into the city is backed up, or indeed for flexibility in the case of traffic incidents on either side of the bridge?

If not, is this something the government would consider?

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the member for the question. The Department of State Growth's management of the tidal flow on the Tasman Bridge is based on balancing the traffic coming towards the city from the eastern shore, as well as the traffic that is travelling through the city on Macquarie Street towards the Tasman Bridge.

The department actively manages the changeover to optimise traffic flows for the overall network. The timing of the tidal flow lane changeover at the end of the morning peak is generally around 9.00 a.m. It may vary by 15 minutes, or sometimes longer, to balance traffic demand in both directions, including the Tasman Highway and the Greater Hobart network.

In the lead-up to the 9.00 a.m. tidal flow lane changeover, travel times from the eastern shore typically begin to reduce and then continue to reduce after the lane changeover has occurred.

However, the traffic that is travelling through the city on Macquarie Street towards the Tasman Bridge generally does not begin to decrease until after the lane changeover has occurred because there is only a single lane for traffic from the city on the approach to the bridge during the morning tidal flow. As a result, regularly delaying the switch to after 9.00 a.m. would disproportionately increase the traffic backups on Macquarie Street through the city.


MOTION

Budget Papers 2025-26 and Appropriation Bills (No. 1 and No. 2) - Noting

Resumed from above (page 30).

[2.56 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre) - Mr President, it looked like a lesson on how to clear the room there, but I am pleased to see some have returned. People have a lot to do around this place, I absolutely acknowledge that.

Before the lunchbreak, I was talking about telecommunications and some of the issues and challenges people face in some of the areas I represent. I was relating a story about Richard Duncan from the Northern Midlands area, who was very proactive and, with the support of the Northern Midlands Business Association, was able to work both with the Commonwealth and state governments and Telstra Communications to deliver an upgrade for the community in the Cressy-Longford area. That made a big difference to the lives of many, and that cooperative approach is what I suggest is needed in a lot of areas, particularly those that I represent. I look forward to the government working with, again, Telstra and the federal government, to support and fund some of those upgrades where the towers need an extension or there needs to be a booster or whatever that looks like, to make our services more reliable. As I said, particularly for people who work on their own, and sadly, you never know what might happen, particularly in some of those rural and remote areas, if there is no connectivity for them.

I give my full support to retaining the current health services that are available in my communities across McIntyre. More importantly, I would very much like to see the expansion of the access to reliable and consistent GP services.

Now, three of my larger centres, St Helens and surrounding towns in the Break O'Day LGA, Scottsdale in the north-east in the Dorset community, and Deloraine and those living in the Meander Valley area, are all serviced by the same medical practice. The wait times to see a GP vary from days to weeks, and to consistently see the same GP is extremely difficult and continues to be a challenge for many of my constituents.

Just yesterday, my office had had some contact with a gentleman who has lived in the area for 13 years, so not a new resident - You have to call the GP practice at 8.30 a.m.to make an appointment. You can only call that morning. You cannot make a prior appointment, so you cannot arrange your day until you have called at 8.30 a.m. This particular gentleman had called and called and called with no success, and rang my office out of sheer frustration to say, 'What are we supposed to do if you cannot get an appointment with a GP?' We know what happens, if someone leaves an issue for any length of time, then what do they do? Nine times out of 10, out of necessity, they have to present to the emergency department.

I note in the information that was provided in the budget papers, 177,852 presentations to the EDs across Tasmania in the last financial year. How many of those presentations could have been diverted had they had access to a GP? We probably will never know that. That is probably not a statistic that is available, but to my mind, it would be very interesting to have some understanding of the impact not being able to access a GP in a timely manner - or at all, as was the case for my Ledgerwood constituent yesterday - is on presentations to EDs.

I am always pleased to read that the state has recruited more than 3000 new healthcare workers in the last 12 months. We know, as it says here, 'We are continuing our commitment for recruiting 78 new full-time paramedics, including 27 community paramedics, as well as 40 new GPs for regional and rural communities.' That is fantastic, but we need to get those 40 new GPs into the regional and rural communities sooner rather than later. It is one of those issues that continues to be of concern.

Timely and accessible ambulance services continue to be high on the list of concerns from members of the community. I note, again, in the information that was provided, new ambulance stations for Longford, which is a growing area in the Northern Midlands. I am not sure if anyone has looked over to see the amount of growth just in the Perth area. As you know, Mr President, we bypass Perth to some extent now, but if you look over to your right as you come in on the highway, you will see an enormous number of new builds across that area. There is another subdivision just on the bottom side of Devon Hills and if you have had a drive around Longford anytime lately, you will see the same level of growth again in that area. So, the Northern Midlands is certainly growing and a new ambulance station for Longford will be well received, as will the new ambulance station for Bicheno. I know the member for Prosser, the Acting Deputy Leader, referred to that in his contribution, because the Bicheno community will also be served by the bottom end of my electorate as our electorates meet at that part of the east coast community. Those 27 community paramedics, from the additional 78 full-time paramedics being recruited, will be a welcome addition to those areas.

I note there is a quite a bit of information about expanding access to health care and boosting frontline services, and it provides quite a big list for the north, north-west and south of the state. So, plenty happening in the health space, 34 per cent of the state's Budget is directed to health and healthcare services for our Tasmanians.

Does that mean that everyone has timely access? Does it mean that everyone who is waiting on a surgical list is being seen and having their issue addressed? I expect that the answer to that is no. I will make an observation here. I know that the government might not necessarily have an answer for it, but I expect that there may be an opportunity to discuss this issue that I am raising with the federal government at a later time. I would like to think that the Minister for Health would take this on board as well.

Recently, a person whom I know quite well presented to A&E and the service for an incident that had happened and needed immediate attention. They also needed some surgery. Name, address, year of birth, a few other details, but not once was that person asked if they had private health insurance. They used a bed and all the facilities that were available at the Launceston General Hospital. The service was outstanding, no issue there. They have continued to need rehabilitation, follow-up medical appointments, physiotherapy and the like. Again, not once was there a request, 'Do you have private health insurance?'

It is no wonder that people in our community think, when they are finding things a little bit tough, 'Well, what can I let go of in my family budget? What can I save a few dollars on every month on or every week?' However they might pay - or a yearly payment for private health is quite a substantial amount of money now. There was an opportunity for the public system to bill back to the private system, private health insurance, and account for this particular person. How often does that happen at our public hospitals? That person could have been a private patient in the public system, and in my view, they should have been, taking some pressure off the public system when it comes to continual funding. I would respectfully ask that that be something that is discussed.

I know there is a rebate, when you do your income tax, if you have private health insurance. Perhaps that rebate needs to be increased to encourage more people to not only hang onto and continue to contribute to their private health system, if they are able to, and then for those who are paying private health and then not being asked the appropriate questions at the time of being admitted for any particular medical service.

Food for thought, which has crossed my mind on a number of occasions since that time: If I were in a position of not being able to afford private health insurance, I would dare say, 'Well, do I really need it? I can just access the public system because it is a good system.' I choose to hang onto mine, because I recently used my private health insurance to attend a private hospital at the time that suited my surgeon and myself with the commitments that I have. I will be hanging onto mine, but I can understand why people in our community choose to let it go and that again, in turn, puts more pressure on a public health system that is funded to the tune of 34 per cent of Tasmania's state budget. 

Another one of those health areas that I ponder as I travel around my electorate is utilising the rural hospitals, particularly for patients transferring from the four major public hospitals but still requiring care after being discharged from those hospitals. The NESM Hospital, Deloraine Hospital and St Helens Hospital are fantastic facilities and I would suggest that if those hospitals had permanent full-time staff, they would be in a position to take more people back from the four regional hospitals - in this case, I think you would probably say one major hospital, the LGH, and not so much the southern or the two northern facilities. Take them back to what we call home base and utilise the very good care that they receive at their local hospital. It is much easier for family and friends to come and visit. Often the recovery is quicker if you know that you are receiving visitors and you are receiving good care just prior to being released or discharged completely from the health system.

I believe it is absolutely the right thing to do, but I know that there is an issue with having the staffing at the right staffing levels at those regional hospital facilities. Let us get that in place. I know plenty of people who travel to the major hospitals because they need full-time employment, and do not stay in their home base because they are only offered part-time work. Not everyone wants to work part-time. It does not always pay the bills. 

With a 12 per cent increase in health care since last year's budget, we need to be working smarter, because at that increase I would expect that you can only go so far until health is eating up 50 per cent of the budget, and then what is cut? It has to be something. Education has increased by 5 per cent to $9.9 billion with public order and safety, a 7 per cent increase to $3.8 billion, massive numbers on what is referred to as the three biggies. 

Saul Eslake has made a detailed assessment of the state's finances, and the numbers certainly do not paint a pretty picture. We have heard that well and truly from the member for Murchison in her contribution today. I have listened to 20 of those previous contributions, so when she said, 'I am not sure how I can even speak to this', I certainly sat up and took notice. 

The Treasurer remains optimistic of returning to surplus down the track, and according to one media report, that surplus is a long and winding road; it was suggested that the long and winding road may not even have an end to it.
When it says the government's gross debt per capita, excluding the defined benefit superannuation liability of around $400 million per year, is budgeted to increase from $18,878 in 2024-25 to $23,157 in the coming year, and it will reach nearly $30,000 per capita by 2029-30. There are some concerns by those who understand well, and particularly watch closely, the finances of our state.

I was interested in the reporting of an Efficiency and Productivity Unit that will be established to audit all government programs and systems. It is a savings measure announced in last year's Budget, increasing to $150 million per year by 2026-27, and it will be continued with an additional savings measure of $150 million per annum from 2027-28.

I am interested in the cost of establishing that unit, because we always have to be mindful that by establishing something else to effectively look at the audit of all government programs and systems, how much that is actually costing and how much we are actually saving from that. I am no finance expert, and I am happy to be challenged on that, but I am interested to have some understanding of what that actually does cost to find those savings. I thought that would just be a matter of course for all government departments that they look at what can be saved.

We have talked about efficiency dividends. They have named them up as all sorts of things over the years, and I would have thought it would just be a matter of course now that whatever can be saved is saved. Effectively it might be a position in that department. If you can find some savings and some efficiencies and you can hang on to people's positions, that spreads across the department and lightens the load; less burnout, less time people are off on leave when they suggest that the work is too great for them. I am really interested in having some understanding around that.

I know that the Estimates Committee B will be looking at the Minister for Finance next week through the estimates process. I expect we will take an opportunity to look at those areas and see what is being done in that area. The other committee, Committee A, will have the Treasurer in front of them. There will be a myriad of questions for the Treasurer on his first budget. I did not put my congratulations to the Treasurer for his first budget, but the sheer work that goes into presenting a budget, you have to acknowledge that it is a big job.

I note no new taxes, and nobody wants to hear about possible new taxes. The question is, how can the spend continue without more revenue? What does that additional revenue look like into the future? New business, perhaps more businesses, more Tasmanians working. With Tasmania's unemployment rate already at 3.8 per cent, a record low for the state, how much more employment is on offer? Perhaps part of the answer is Tasmanians moving from underemployment through casual and part-time employment to full-time employment.

We hear a lot about being underemployed and most people, particularly the younger demographic, are happy to be in full-time employment. They do not need a day off in the middle of the week necessarily. I mean it is nice, but if you are not being paid for it, it might be of no use. It might be better off towards your rent, towards paying some of those expenses that you have just for general living.

So, more opportunities for our state through more visitors to our state, so much potential. How is that potential harnessed for a positive future for our state? I think they are really big questions, but when we say, 'No new taxes', and I heard clearly from the member for Murchison, there needs to be a conversation about how this state generates more revenue, simple as that. I have just suggested two or three that may be worth exploring. I do not want to advocate for new taxes, but I also understand that the state needs more revenue. 

The sale of government businesses continues to generate discussion right across the state. Four more businesses are off the table. I do not think that anyone has read those in yet. From page 16 of the budget speech - Mr Eslake has been doing quite a bit of work for the government and in other areas as well. I just read part of a report that he provided to a group of organisations only last week.

Those that have been taken off the list for sale are the Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority, TASCORP, Tasracing, TasRail, Entura, and the Public Trustee. Will there not be a sigh of relief on behalf of those areas that have avoided the chop or avoided the sale. From continuing to read, I understand that there is an independent assessment and the government is determined not to pursue a merger of TasRail, TT-Line and TasPorts. That may be a bit frosty at the moment, a relationship between TT-Line and TasPorts, although there are some new people at the helm of those businesses. 

Perhaps the frost is thawing and there might be some cooperative discussions moving forward on how each of those GBEs can actually support each other in the benefit of the state. It would be delightful news to a lot of people. We also know that Hydro is safe and, again, they have been safe all along.

It goes on to say, 'The remaining government businesses will continue to be thoroughly assessed.' We will wait and see; as we know, that will be a decision for the parliament. I have been around for a while now. Remember when we sold the TOTE? There was a nose for it back in the day. We had a deed in place following that sale; there will be some negotiations and discussions about that. I feel sure that will be one of the key points that Estimates Committee B will be discussing with the minister next week at Estimates, where the negotiations are in regard to the deed of agreement to fund the racing industry in Tasmania.

I note that as I was travelling yesterday I heard the news on the radio that the Devonport Greyhound Track is off the radar of Tasracing, after a long-held promise when they were moved from their previous home, the Devonport Showgrounds, to make way for a housing subdivision and they were told that there would be a new home for them. It has been a number of years now, and I do not recall how many, but here we are. The greyhound industry will be wondering what happened to those promises. There is a bit of water to go under the bridge there before we have an outcome for that.

I wrote here it is a challenge not to be super cautious when it comes to our state-owned businesses and any future sales. I will leave that one because at this point, we do not have anything before the parliament and there is work still being done to assess whether there is opportunity or not.

Easing the cost-of-living pressures is always welcome. When that assists all households across McIntyre, I expect it is appreciated as well by all Tasmanian households. I note in the information that it was $60 for each household. Here we are; easing the cost-of-living pressures, delivering a $60 credit for every Tasmanian household's energy bill as part of the renewable energy dividend. I also note, that, at the moment, there is an initiative for installing or buying a battery pack. If you have already got solar and you need to store the solar energy because at the moment the feed-in tariff is worth -
Mr Duigan - One of the highest in the nation.

Ms RATTRAY - But not worth much.

Mr Duigan - Highest in the nation.

Ms RATTRAY - But it is not worth much. Even if it is the highest in the nation, it is still not worth much.

Mr Duigan - Highest in the nation.

Ms RATTRAY - You need to store. That is the message I received down the highway. You need to store into your battery. There are some good programs where you can receive from $1500, depends what type of battery you are buying, up to like $3000. I do not have all the detail. If you have already got solar, if it is part of your home and you are not getting the return that you had hoped for, you are able to store and use it at a later time. I expect that is a very useful thing for households to help with the easing of cost-of-living pressures.

Another one of those easing of cost-of-living pressures, slashing public transport fares for students and regional routes by half. That is always welcome when students can travel to education because this place decided that unless you have got a full-time, or actually I think it might be not quite a full-time load, you still need to be in education until the age of 18. We need to support students, particularly regional students, if we are going to expect them to continue to turn up to education. That is just a no-brainer. You have to do that. Again, welcome.

As for public transport generally, not a lot of the communities I represent are fortunate to have too much public transport available. But since the Kinetic business has taken over some of the routes and areas in McIntyre, it has certainly delivered a regular service. That has been a real positive. They also do school buses; take students to school, to their education facilities, whether it be to school or local schools, or to year 11 and 12 from my patch in Launceston.

It talks about record concessions across rates, energy, transport and water. I mean, same year in, year out.

Expanding the Healthy School Lunch Program to include more schools, saving families up to $950 a year. That is significant money being saved for families when it comes to school lunches. How can you say that is not a useful initiative to have because if you are hungry, you do not concentrate. It is a well-known fact, and it is good to be able to have those healthy lunches, otherwise some people possibly would not get the nutritional benefit that makes them grow and be healthy and contribute positively to society.

And the encouraging social and physical activity through the Ticket to Wellbeing and Ticket to Play, I had something written down about that.

Mr Duigan - Good programs.

Ms RATTRAY - Absolutely. A little later on, I will touch on those.

Making housing more affordable and accessible. If only we could build them a bit quicker but when we take builders out of their trade and put them in the parliament, it is one less builder building houses. I acknowledge stamp duty exemption for first-home buyers, which is known and continues to assist first-time owners. I would like some more detail on the numbers of Tasmanians taking up the MyHome shared equity program, given that it is under the 2 per cent deposit requirement. I note the increased income limits in this year's Budget.

Again, we will have an opportunity to look at that MyHome shared equity program next week with the Minister for Housing. He has the heads up, bring the information because we will be asking on that given the income limit has been increased in this year's Budget.

More Child and Family Centres, and I note that one of those centres, I am pretty sure was announced in last year's Budget, but if you are going to reannounce it when it is in my patch, happy to take it on board. But again, for the Scottsdale area, there has been quite a lot of lobbying for Child and Family Centres. Quite some years ago, on an electorate tour for the former member for Rosevears - now that was a time or two ago now - we went to the Exeter Child and Family Centre, from memory. I really am testing my memory now. Beaconsfield. Thank you, Minister for Education and Acting Leader, all over it. Beaconsfield, and they were singing the praises of that Child and Family Centre all those years ago. If the Child and Family Centres that have been announced end up giving back to the community the same benefits as the Beaconsfield Child and Family Centre has for many years in its community, then it will be an exceptionally welcomed facility.

Members - Hear, hear.

Ms RATTRAY - Volunteers across our state - and I note that the member for Elwick, in her contribution to the noting of the Premier's Address last week, talked about the volunteers in her electorate. Thankfully we all have them in our electorates: service clubs, community services, those people who drive the community vehicles, they deliver the Meals on Wheels, they are hospital auxiliary members; and I talked about a 61-year member of the hospital auxiliary this morning, Kitty Ranson, and her contribution to the community.

I am not sure that everyone will have 61 years of dedication in their area, but I feel sure there will be many with decades of commitment to their communities. Our sporting clubs' supporters who carry out the important roles - and I do not mean the players - the trainers, the coaches, the timekeepers, the goal umpires, the kiosk workers and the list goes on, every organisation has them.

I absolutely agree with the member for Elwick; our communities would be so much poorer without these amazing people carrying out these roles. When an organisation receives funding, the benefits are significantly multiplied right across an organisation, and in turn to the community to which they belong and the Tasmanian community more broadly. I place on the record my absolute thanks to all of those volunteers across our communities, not just in my McIntyre electorate. You are absolute gold.

The successful Ticket to Play, with the $100 vouchers available for young people to help with sporting fees, has been extended in addition to the $100 Ticket to Wellness, which keeps our older Tasmanians active and engaged with sporting and recreation activities. Pickleball is the new game for perhaps my vintage, a former badminton player. I have a need to prove it. Not the best functioning knee going around, but it is mine. We used to play badminton in my younger day. I have not played pickleball yet. But I have some friends who are loving playing. They said even I could play. I am pretty excited about having a look at a game of pickleball sometime in the future. This is around those older Tasmanians keeping active and engaged with sporting and recreation activities.

These vouchers also include the Veteran Wellbeing Voucher Program. We know how important that is to support our veterans; they are integral. They have been a significant part of our communities, and they have looked out for us and now it is our turn to look out for them, so I support that.

A couple of initiatives I have here on page 7: boosting support to 50 community organisations so they can continue to provide food relief to our most vulnerable. I want to give a shout out here to an initiative that started up in my office hometown, in Dorset; the Red Dirt Café. Once a week a group of people come together, all food is donated, and they use the Nugget Sellers Pavilion, where the Crows football used to be. They provide a meal and an opportunity for people who might be eating alone the other six nights of the week to come together and network and share a meal. The number of people who head over to the Red Dirt Cafe and share that experience on a Wednesday night, one night a week, is just fantastic. Karen and Don Rainbow are just true community champions; with a solid band of helpers, they deliver a hearty meal. It is not just about the meal, because if you can pay, they are happy to take a donation, but it is not about providing the donation to eat the meal, it is about the fellowship and networking just as equally. Congratulations to them. 

I class them as one of those wonderful organisations possibly sitting alongside the 50 community organisations that provide food relief for our most vulnerable. It is not necessarily about whether you have the means to fund every meal that you need; it is about that fellowship, that opportunity to network and to meet people whom you might not have got to know otherwise. I take my hat off to them and if I ever get some time, I would love to be part of that organisation.

Another one of those organisations that is continuing to be supported is our neighbourhood houses. Some are referred to as community houses; some are referred to as neighbourhood houses. I know the Dorset Community House better than most, but also every other community house or neighbourhood house in my communities has a fridge where you can go in and you can buy mostly vegetables and some fruits. If you do not have the means to purchase, then you just ask and it is provided. That emergency food relief is so important, particularly if you have a family and you are struggling. It is really important to have those three vegetables at the very least for your evening meal.

I made the point earlier in my contribution that when it comes to the budget, every year I am genuinely confronted by the magnitude of the papers. I end up absolutely in a bit of a flap, like most, just trying to understand the fiscal balances, the net operating balances, the cash balances and how it all works.

Ms O'Connor - You are not alone. It is intense.

Ms RATTRAY - Thank you. I even heard the member for Murchison say it, and I know she has worked hard to get her head around it.

Ms O'Connor - We have been here a long time and it is still hard work.

Ms RATTRAY - I liken it almost to when you think you have the taxation department worked out and they move the goal post. You think, 'I could claim that last year, now I cannot claim that.' It is a moveable feast. I understand that that is the nature of it, but to drill down into it in the finest of detail does take a lot of effort from people who do not have a finance background. I do my utmost and I know for a matter of fact that the members of the committee that I sit on equally do their homework as forensically as we can. Particularly this place, casting no aspersions on the other place, we do our best to get through the budget line by line, output group by output group. People do put a lot of effort into preparing for the Estimates process, which will take four days of next week and then a bit of a wrap-up after that.

That is pretty much my offering for today. Yes, there is a long and winding road. I will also be the eternal optimist here because we have no alternative but to continue to work with what we have, but I suggest that we - that is all of us - need to have a really hard conversation about how we can generate some more revenue. Now, I offered up two or three suggestions on how there might be more revenue coming into the state. Is having no new taxes the way to continue or do we need to look at how we generate revenue for our state?

There are people in and around this place and some other places - up here and over there - with more expertise than I could ever have, but I am happy to be part of any conversation that looks at how to find a bit of a pot of gold at the end of that long and winding road because we have to find it. We just have to. We represent our state. It is really important that we that we have a positive outlook. It is a privilege to be a member of this parliament, and I will do everything I can to progress our state in a positive manner. I note the Budget.

[3.47 p.m.]
Mr HARRISS (Huon) - Mr President, I start by agreeing with the member for McIntyre that I, too, find it a challenge to read or listen to the Budget on a Thursday and be back here with something to offer on a Tuesday. That is okay, but you will have to bear with me.

There are some positive things that this Budget delivers, but overwhelmingly it is not a positive document. It is a huge disappointment to Tasmanians who were promised that an increase in parliament numbers at the 2024 state election would deliver better government. I have spoken before about the extent of that increase, 40 per cent in the House of Assembly and 25 per cent for the parliament as a whole. There is an obligation on the parliament to deliver a return for that very substantial taxpayer investment. On the evidence of the budget, that is not happening. Things are getting worse, not better. The Premier, in his second reading speech for the Expansion of House of Assembly Bill 2022, said:

We must restore this House to deliver for the Tasmanian people, not just for the members gathered here today, or the government I lead, but for our future. It is overdue. The demands on government today are greater than ever. We understand the world is a more complex place than it was in 1998, and we strive to face its challenges and complexities, not turn away from them.

This is now the second budget presented since the parliamentary numbers were increased. There has been a full year to prepare, so if things were going to improve, you would expect to see evidence in the government's principal operational and financial blueprint. Unfortunately, that is not what we are seeing. Instead of facing its financial challenges and complexities, the government is turning away from them. Instead of paying its way, it is putting the bills on the public credit card and building a mountain of debt. The scale of increase in that debt is accelerating rapidly. The cost of servicing the debt is also skyrocketing and, on the current trajectory, will increasingly eat into our capacity to provide services Tasmanians need.

None of this is obvious from the government's budget media statements. It prefers to maintain the fiction that it is on a pathway to surplus. The Treasurer talks about a responsible pathway to surplus. The trouble is there is a yawning gulf between the Treasurer's message and the facts disclosed in the details of the budget documents. The discrepancy is so wide that I am reminded of the warning issued by George Orwell in his essay Politics and the English Language, published back in 1946:

Political language … is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.

Tasmanians know that to manage family finances requires discipline. To avoid going broke, they need to ensure that spending does not outstrip their earning capacity. If they borrow, they need to ensure they can afford the repayments and if they use a credit card, they know that there are limits, as well as substantial interest costs. Governments are not constrained by the same limitations, but all governments recognise that there are financial rules that need to be respected to ensure that they pay their way over time to avoid imposing a financial burden on future generations. The record suggests that this government has lost sight of those rules and the costs are spiralling.

The state of Tasmania's public finances was laid out starkly in the independent review by Saul Eslake in August last year. Mr Eslake found that the state's public finances had deteriorated significantly since 2017 and warned that a protracted failure to ensure fiscal sustainability would almost inevitably lead to fiscal crisis and increase the risk of long-term economic damage. In the absence of corrective policy action, he warned that government finances would worsen further over the next decade, with cash deficits totalling $12.7 billion, net debt rising to more than $16 billion, interest payments virtually tripling and an almost certain downgrade of Tasmania's credit rating, further increasing the cost of borrowing. He pointed to the basic problem, which is that the government does not raise enough money to cover its spending, and recommended a 10-year plan, including revenue-raising measures, to put the budget back into balance and on a sustainable footing.

The medicine was too strong for the patient and the government was quick to rule out Eslake's key measures, such as revenue increases, and continued to increase spending in the Budget currently being presented to the parliament. The lack of corrective action is unfortunate. One of the overlooked aspects of Eslake's report is that it acknowledges the generosity, insights, advice and assistance of the past four heads of the Treasury department, Michael Vertigan, Don Challen, Martin Wallace and Tony Ferrall. While Mr Eslake is careful to emphasise that the report is his own work, there is no doubt it is thoroughly researched and very well grounded.

There were a number of findings in Eslake's report that deserve attention because they point to future risks if they are not addressed. For instance, the net operating balance outcomes for the six years to 2022-23 are almost $1.6 billion worse than originally projected, despite factors beyond the government's control improving by almost $4 billion over the same period. Across the same six years, government policy decisions increased spending by $5.7 billion, offset by decisions to increase revenue totalling just $265 million.

Mr Eslake sums up by saying the review's unambiguous conclusion is that the trajectory of all the indicators of the Tasmanian government's financial position is unsustainable, all of the metrics are heading in the wrong direction. It appears probable that in the absence of a credible strategy to prevent Tasmania's public finances from continuing along this trajectory, Tasmania's credit rating would be downgraded, possibly by more than one notch, which in turn will likely result in Tasmania having to pay higher interest rates on new debt.

It is not as if these warnings were new. The Eslake report listed a series of warnings about fiscal sustainability issued by the Treasury in 2016, 2019 and 2021, all of which went unheeded.

The Eslake report was released in August 2024, so there was insufficient time for the key findings to be considered in the budget, which came out just a month later.

However, lack of time is no excuse this year.

What have we got? Not much progress at all, it appears to me, except for fervent wish that things might be different somewhere down the track. Or, as a contributor to the Mercury put it, 'They hope that the tooth fairy will appear with all the solutions.'

As the independent expert who has immersed himself in the state's financial detail, it is fair to turn to Saul Eslake for his opinion.

This is what he reported:

The 2025-26 Tasmanian Budget puts fiscal sustainability off to another day.

The financial position of Tasmania's public sector continues to deteriorate, according to the numbers presented in the 2025-26 State Budget…

Although the Treasurer contends that his first Budget 'provides a clear and sensible pathway to surplus' and that the Government is 'on track to deliver a Net Operating Surplus by 2029-30', there are no surpluses shown anywhere in the forward estimates set out in today's Budget Papers.

On the contrary, the Budget Papers show that for the 'general government' sector (which comprises departments and agencies funded through the Public Account) …

the government will incur net operating deficits totalling $3.5 billion over the four years to 2027-28, $1.5 billion more than foreshadowed in the Revised Estimates Report … published in February this year (and $1.8 billion more than forecast in last year's Budget), with a further net operating deficit of $236 million projected for 2028-29;

excluding one-off grants from the Federal Government for capital purposes (which are included in the revenue side of the 'net operating balance' even though the spending of those grants isn't included on the expense side), the government will incur 'underlying' net operating deficits totalling $5.3 billion over the four years to 2028-29 (and $1.2 billion more than was forecast in February, with a further $528 million 'underlying' net operating deficits forecast for 2028-29'

more importantly, from the perspective of being able to stem the ongoing rise in (let alone start repaying) debt, the government will incur cash deficits totalling $5.1 billion over the four years to 2027-28, $441 million more than projected in February (and $1.2 billion more than forecast in last year's Budget), with a further cash deficit of $498 million projected for 2028-29;

as a the result of which, net debt is now forecast to reach $10.2 billion by 30th June 2028, $562 million more than forecast in February … and to rise further [to' $10.8 billion by 30th June 2029.

Mr Eslake concludes by observing that the Budget's projected declines in the net operating and cash deficits between 2024-25 and 2028-29 rely on a projected slowdown in the average rate of growth in operating expenses to just 0.3 per cent a year - by far the lowest over any four-year period this century.

In other words, the Budget makes some heroic assumptions about expenditure restraints which are totally at odds with the government spending record in which gives no confidence that state debt can be contained.

The real debt is heading for $20 billion once the unfunded public sector superannuation scheme and GBE debt, for which Tasmanian taxpayers are ultimately responsible, is taken into account.

As TasCOSS has pointed out, debt servicing costs are blowing out at an exponential rate, and that comes at the cost of spending in other areas including housing. Borrowing costs will -

MOTION

Budget Papers 2025-26 and Appropriation Bills (No. 1 and No. 2) - Noting

Resumed from above. 

Mr HARRISS - Mr President, I was up to talking about some borrowing costs. Borrowing costs will almost triple by 2028-29 and Treasury estimates that the net interest charges will total more than $1.5 billion over the forward estimates.

Page 74 of budget paper 1 indicates that government is falling well short of meeting the fiscal targets that are designed to ensure fiscal sustainability, in other words, that we can live within our means.

We fall short on our credit ratings, gross debt per capita, net debt to gross state product, cost of debt to cash receipts, fiscal balance, government sector own-source revenue as a percentage of total expenditure and government sector full-time equivalents per capita. In some of those areas we fall a long way short. Treasury is warning that the risks of further deterioration are high. For instance, on high forecast borrowing levels, it says:

Tasmania's finances are increasingly exposed to interest rate changes given the increasing levels of borrowings due to the forecast of public account cash deficits over the Forward Estimates.

Of the productivity and efficiency measures targeting 2500 public sector jobs, it says:

Achievement of the savings measures is an important part of the Fiscal Strategy. If these measures are not achieved there will be a corresponding impact on the Key Fiscal Measures.

With most of the State Service wage agreements due for renegotiation this year, Treasury warns that any outcome beyond the 2.5 per cent provided in the Budget will impact the bottom line. There is a further risk from a rise in the cost of workers compensation claims, particularly mental health-related claims for emergency and frontline workers, which on average are costing almost eight times more than claims for physical injuries.

There are yet more risks, according to Treasury, related to cost increases and deliverability on infrastructure projects, including Macquarie Wharf 6 and the Macquarie Point project, the TT-Line vessel replacement and port infrastructure projects, and Macquarie Point sewage treatment plant relocation, and large energy projects. On any reading, the issues are getting bigger and the solutions further away.

The government's fallback option appears to be asset sales. It has accepted advice from Mr Eslake against selling the Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority, TASCORP, Tasracing, TasRail, Entura, the Public Trustee, and in addition has ruled out selling Hydro Tasmania and the TT-Line. That still leaves Aurora, STT, MAIB, the Public Finance Corporation, Metro Tasmania, Tasmanian Irrigation, TasNetworks and TasPorts on the chopping block.

I have indicated previously that I have questions about TasPorts remaining in public hands because of the massive differences in the handling and cost of the respective north and south terminals for the new ferries, but in general I am not persuaded by the privatisation argument, firstly, because it seems that the idea only comes up when governments have made a mess of the budget. If it was such a great idea, you would expect it might be advanced between budget crises. That has not happened, and in fact most of the hand-on-heart pledges have been to keep major assets like Hydro in public hands for the benefit of all Tasmanians. Most Tasmanians see Hydro as much more than the dams and generating assets. Certainly, the transmission and distribution assets are part of keeping the lights on, and I cannot detect any public sentiment in my electorate to flog them off. I think the same reluctance to get rid of productive public assets applies to other organisations on the government's hit list.

My second reason for having doubts about the benefits of asset sales is the history of what happened to the Victorian power system. The Kennett government inherited a huge budget mess in the 1990s and sold off a heap of assets, including the power system, to get the state back in the black. However, 30 years down the track, Victoria is back in the same budget black hole that it was in the early 90s, with the exception that it no longer has the Public Asset Bank to flog off even if it wanted to.

What is clear is that the pathway out of Tasmania's budget problem is responsible budget management that has been missing in action since 2017 and needs to be resurrected urgently. Instead, we are going backwards into more debt and deficit. All that will do is load our children and grandchildren with an unfair start to their working life because we as a state could not manage money. This is not a responsible proposition.

The question is: what do we do about it? I do not think we can afford to sit on our hands. I note that the Constitution Act 1934 provides that the Legislative Council may return a money bill to the House of Assembly, requesting amendment of the bill. In my opinion, it may be a bit too sudden to take advantage of that provision and send the budget back this year, but I would certainly support sending the government a message that I would be prepared to do so if we were to receive another budget, simply pushing off the need for substantive action to some further date while the state's finances continue to deteriorate.

I note the Budget.

[4.38 p.m.]
Ms ARMITAGE (Launceston) - Mr President, the annual budget is a key moment every year for any government. A budget is not merely a set of numbers or an analysis of the state's financial position, it is a document which, at its heart, outlines the policy priorities of the government. We are always keen to see what is contained in the budget and what the priorities for the next 12 months will be. Some of them are expected and some are surprises, and there will always be many worthy policies that receive funding and many which do not. That is what makes the budget so important and can be very difficult for governments to get right. So, too, is the budget a document which assesses the performance of the government's financial management over the past few years and the predicted expenditure over the next 12 months and beyond.

Obviously, as a state we are very reliant on receiving funds from the federal government's GST pool. We consequently have very significant responsibilities when it comes to properly and responsibly funding things like health, education and emergency and social services, especially when we look at our performance and compare it with other jurisdictions. We need to have a clear set of policies that acknowledge our performance as a state and devise achievable ways of improving it where it is lacking.

Everything the government does, all public administration, requires resourcing. The better things are resourced, the better services tend to be delivered, but it must be backed up by good policy and needs to maintain a focus on supporting Tasmanians as well as possible. The budget process helps us to determine what works, what does not work, and what can be changed to make sure services are delivered well and for a fair amount of resourcing.

Good government spending is essentially investment in good public administration and the people who make it happen. This is a spectrum that ranges right from our frontline workers to people who research and devise policies.

The headline from this Budget is debt, an 11-digit number with our net debt reaching $10.7 billion. As the Examiner newspaper highlighted, that equates to a debt of almost $1900 for every Tasmanian adult and child and is primarily the result of government borrowings, which are estimated to reach $8.41 billion by 30 June 2026, just a year away. In addition to this, expenses over the Budget's forward estimates are anticipated to be $10.3 billion on average per year and revenue is expected to be $9.7 billion on average per year - a significant shortfall.

If you listen to Saul Eslake, he says that this $10.8 billion debt ignores the debt carried by government-owned entities and superannuation liabilities, making the net debt figure closer to $17.6 billion. Instead of it being $1900 for every Tasmanian adult and child, we are looking at something considerably higher.

Amongst other things, the increase in interest rates and borrowing costs, infrastructure costs, claims against the state by victim/survivors of child sexual abuse and a rise in health spending have been identified as key risks in the Budget.

The Australian published a scathing piece about the Budget, noting the following:

$300 million being allocated for a second power interconnector to Victoria, with the government conceding it may never eventuate.

Describing the aim to cut the public service by 2500 jobs at a cost of $150 million per year as a raise again.

That the government appeared confused about when the record debt being accrued by the state would start being paid down, saying Mr Barnett said, 'The $10.6 billion Budget gets the balance right.'

That the Treasurer expressed optimism that a surplus could be delivered in 2029-30, if not earlier.

That the historically high level of debt was manageable and necessary, even though it concerned economists.

That 'the Rockliff government will allow net debt, negligible when the Liberals came to power in 2014, to balloon from $5.26 billion this financial year to $10.78 billion in 2028-29.'

I do not know what more I can say. It is extremely worrying, and people rightly have many questions about the government's spending priorities. When we have record levels of debt that need to be managed, the focus on big ticket, big-spending items like the stadium makes people feel very unheard, overlooked and wondering if their needs matter at all.

I took note a few weeks ago of some of the other matters of wasteful spending the government has engaged in recently, especially some of the high-priced consultancies that were revealed, including:

$76,000 for a financial adviser at the Macquarie Point urban renewal project.

$206,223 to a strategy and culture organisation for work that could have been done by existing employees of the State Growth trade team.

$137,660 to a Melbourne-based firm to review the governance, financial sustainability and strategic role of the Theatre Royal board; the organisation's relationship with the University of Tasmania; and opportunities presented by the Hedberg redevelopment. This one is not even being undertaken by a Tasmanian firm.

So much money continues to be thrown at third parties, some of which are not even based in Tasmania. To look at uniquely Tasmanian issues or opportunities, I am unsure why our departments and agencies are being resourced to find the best employees to do this work in-house, when so much of it appears to be outsourced, at significant cost, to some people and organisations that are not located here.

I cannot see how this indicates good performance and good financial management, but I will be open to hearing about how there is return on investment here. It is especially jarring, when we are also looking at cutting the size of the public sector, which are people's jobs and livelihoods.

Adding to the mix, a sale of public assets, things that belong to all Tasmanians. Tasmanians pay the price for the government's debt. Other assets like Metro, I do question who would want to buy it. I think even the most angelic of angel investors would have a hard time justifying the purchase of Metro. This is a policy that the government simply does not have a mandate for, and it should not be done without being taken to an election and voted in emphatically. Spending is a necessary part of public administration, and it cannot all be criticised. Spending money on necessary services in health, education, emergency services and taking care of Tasmanians is vital. Here, I would like to quote Saul Eslake because he sums it up quite nicely:

… The Government is in the financial pickle it's now in because it kept increasing spending without giving any thought as to how that spending (however justified) should be paid for.

And this Budget shows it still hasn't been able to break the habit.

I'm not saying that all the new spending is 'wasteful' or 'bad'; rather, I'm saying … that this spending should be paid for either by cutting spending in other places, or by raising additional revenue. But the government is simply unwilling to do that.

I also note a document from the Launceston Chamber of Commerce, which has been around for a long, long time and I thought was quite interesting, that is Freight Equalisation and the Ability for our Companies to Compete. It states:

Tasmania's ability to compete depends on how well we move goods, people, and data. As an island economy, every delay or inefficiency has compounding effects. The Chamber strongly supports comprehensive review and reform of the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme. Current settings are too complex and out of step with modern logistics needs. We need a fairer, simpler and more inclusive scheme with flat rate subsidies, streamlined digital claims and expanded eligibility for small exporters and time-sensitive goods. We also seek investment in freight consolidation hubs, digital logistics infrastructure and low emissions transport incentives. Finally, we need accelerated support for projects like the Launceston Airport freight and logistics hub. Every dollar invested in freight productivity returns dividends for our exporters, our supply chains and our economic sovereignty.

An issue that has been around for so long and just never really seems to get resolved.

Another one, while we are talking about cutting public service or public administration, I have spoken to some in the public sector who are very concerned about trying to find cuts in things like police and emergency services. My understanding is that the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management will be required to find $35 million of cuts over the next four years and is budgeting to spend $12 million less on staff than they spent last year. That is the equivalent of 100 police officers.

I find things like that extremely concerning. There is nothing more important than public safety. I know when you speak to people in our community, one of the things they really want to be is safe and I am concerned to see that the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management is required to find such savings. I am sure at the moment that they operate as effectively on as small a budget as possible.

Every year, health is a significant part of our budget, and it demands resourcing and good policy and planning to work properly. I read a couple of weeks ago in The Examiner that the government was planning to provide $14.5 billion over the next four years, equating to nearly $10 million a day. I was therefore shocked to see quite literally on the next page of The Examiner, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF) claiming that the Launceston General Hospital (LGH) air-conditioning upgrades in D block had not been completed. For years and years, the heat in D block at the LGH has caused issues during summer. It has received some media attention over the past summer owing to the fact that staff and patients alike were suffering. Windows in the block cannot be opened, which is stifling, and fans cannot be used because of concerns about transmissible illnesses. The solution last summer was to provide patients with wet flannels and icy poles. The conditions in that part of the hospital have been described more than once as third world. Simply not on. People go to hospital to get better, not to get sicker. A lot of the people in those wards are unable to move. My understanding is part of it is the stroke ward. How terrible to be in a ward that you cannot get out of and you are in stifling conditions.

I do understand that air-conditioning installation in that part of the LGH requires a significant retrofit, but I do not buy the idea that it is not possible. It has been that way for a very long time and these works have not even started. If record funding cannot help change this, then I do not know what will.

What I do know is that there are many motivated people who will not rest until the issues at D Block at the LGH are resolved. I encourage the Health minister and the Premier to look at ways this problem can be finally fixed and get it done.
It was interesting this morning hearing the member for Huon speak about the person from the Huon area with the colonoscopy and the problems with colon cancer. I have raised this in the past, though I have not asked the question for a little while, about the waiting list and how long the waiting list is for categories 1, 2 and 3 to do with colonoscopies. I am sure that it probably has not changed much and I will ask in the next few weeks, but this is another thing: people get the test kits that are sent to them, I think at the age of 45 or 50, or they go to their doctor, they have a faecal test that shows blood, but then if they do not have private health insurance - and how many people, particularly families, can afford it? - they actually have to wait. They cannot get in to have a colonoscopy done. 

We all know the sooner you have treatment, the more likely you are to get a good outcome and a good response. These are issues as well that I think really need addressing. I have asked many questions in the past. I have not asked for a while, but I certainly will, to see what the waiting list is. In the past it has actually been considerable.

Ms Rattray - The gentleman was Matt Duggan.

Ms ARMITAGE – Yes. Another area that I think is worth mentioning is the renal unit at the Kings Meadows Health Centre, and I have been working for quite a long time. I think it is worth mentioning Carolyn Gutteridge, whose husband found out a couple of years ago that he actually needed dialysis and was needing to go to the Kings Meadows site. Carolyn has been working extremely hard to try to have the development, or the redevelopment, done. I believe it was $10 million of federal money that has been sitting there for several years and, of course, every year that it sits there, it is actually worth less. Just reading some of Carolyn's comments, she says:

My concerns remain that the proposed renal facility at Kings Meadows is not providing for the anticipated demand for haemodialysis. There's an urgent need for 24 dialysis chairs, but only 18 will be delivered in stage 1, which is just three more than presently. The proposed building plans have not involved any consultation with patients and there's a distinct lack of windows and natural light, which does not augur well for mental health for patients who are already quite fragile.

Carolyn has met with the Health minister and with many other people, and I think her husband goes three times a week, as do other people, and she said: 

For people to be sitting there all day in a sad situation, they can't even see out a window. I think there are a couple of windows in the ceiling. 

I am really surprised that this still has not been completed and the longer it goes, the less obviously that the money will be provided. 

Our community services are facing a greater strain as well on their resources than we have seen in a very long time. The cost of living is creeping ever into higher-earning brackets; we are seeing more and more people in need of food, clothing, home necessities and help during times like Easter and Christmas. How appalled I was in recent weeks to have seen Shekinah House in Launceston, which provides all of the above and more to people in need, having had their copper piping stolen. 
I do not know if it is the same in Hobart or the north-west coast, but in Launceston it has become quite prevalent. Tasmania Police have told me that it is just such a recurrent thing for people to steal copper piping from businesses. People replace it and then it is stolen again, which is an absolutely shocking situation. 

Shekinah House currently relies on more than 50 volunteers and has provided 2750 showers and 2700 loads of washing since opening the facilities in recent years. The theft of the copper piping completely halted their activities. They could not provide people with showering and bathing facilities, laundry services, or use their kitchen to cook and serve food. Truly I am not sure how low you can go, to steal copper piping from such a vital community service, but there you have it.

The government committing $100,000 to Shekinah House to continue their work is therefore extremely welcome. However, with regard to the copper piping, I would like to point out that it has already been fixed, and would have cost around $6000, if not for the outstanding generosity of a plumber and volunteers who had the water back within two days, with a community member who was willing to pay the bill. Shekinah House is supported by dozens of volunteers, and like any other volunteer and community-based organisation, simply would not be able to function without them.

According to the Volunteering Tasmania 2023 State of Volunteering Report, which is the latest I could find: in 2023, 332,100 Tasmanians, or 69.8 per cent of the population, gave time to volunteer. The average hours volunteered per person was 22.4 per month, and Tasmanians volunteered an overall 89.4 million hours of their time during that year. Just imagine the cost if you had to pay those people.

Not only does volunteering add to our communities and our economy, but it also has an unquantifiable impact on personal wellbeing, social cohesion and general happiness. It is a vital part of living in a connected world such as ours and it should be as easy as possible to join in and volunteer with others in our community.

Therefore, seeing the government's initiative to make registering for a Working with Vulnerable People card free for the next two years is a very welcome development. According to The Examiner, it is understood that the registration fee previously forced volunteers to pay $22.44, which is believed to have been the highest cost across the country. In a state where arguably the need for volunteers is higher than elsewhere, it makes a lot of sense to lower the barriers to volunteering as far as possible.

I would like to note that the Launceston community, on hearing about the theft of copper piping, provided an influx of support, with one person buying 17 new tents from Anaconda to donate. It is very clear that Shekinah House has a very special place in the hearts of Launcestonians and I know that this funding will go very far for this organisation. I hope to see continued support for Shekinah House and organisations like it in the years ahead. As we know, the cost of living is simply getting out of control. It has been this way for some time, which is why services like Shekinah House are so important, and why we need more investment in both cost-of-living relief as well as emergency services that people can turn to when they need help. 

It is good to see the continued funding of programs like the ongoing energy bill relief for some Tasmanians; Ticket to Play vouchers for kids participating in sport; Ticket to Wellness, which keeps older Tasmanians active and engaged with sporting vouchers; providing concessions and subsidies for transport including taxi fares, registration, air and sea travel and driver licences for eligible Tasmanians; the Energy Hardship Fund, providing support to Tasmanians struggling to pay their energy bills; increased concessions for water and sewerage for eligible Tasmanians; continuing the Veteran Wellbeing Voucher Program with 100 vouchers; supporting 50 community organisations to provide food relief; extending the NILS No Interest Loan scheme for Tasmanians on low incomes; continuing support for neighbourhood houses and emergency food relief providers; and ongoing support for the Patient Travel Assistance Scheme, helping Tasmanians who live far away from healthcare services. I cannot help but mention the Patient Travel Assistance scheme, as I have a constituent who tried desperately to access it. This poor lady had a heart condition that needed treatment. Her doctor decided that the quickest way she could have treatment was to fly to Melbourne. Unfortunately for her, the treatment had recently become available in Tasmania but with a considerable wait list, obviously. It was in Hobart and there was quite a wait list. We tried and had still been trying 12 months, I would say it has been going on, and we are getting absolutely nowhere.

She was told she is not eligible because the treatment was available in Tasmania, not the fact that her doctor decided she needed it now and she needed to go to Melbourne to have it. She could not really wait to go on a waitlist. We offered her the thought that maybe, what could happen if she had had to go to Hobart, she still would have received some travel assistance. She would have received so much money per kilometre. She still would have had to have accommodation in Hobart and still would have had to have taxis because she had to stay down there and had to drive.

As she did not meet the criteria for Melbourne, they would not even consider it. Time and time again, I have put this request in. There are people out there who need ongoing support; it does not matter they do all the right things. This pensioner and her husband would have been very happy to have just received what she would have received from going to Hobart for the same treatment, which is where they tell me the treatment was available. Unfortunately, it was refused, because she did not meet the criteria. She had gone to Melbourne and they would not even look at providing the money that she could have had, had she gone to Hobart.

I see that, and it brings back to me this poor lady who was so desperate for such a small amount of money. The number of times I went back to the department and through the minister about it, I sometimes wonder the effort and the time that is taken refusing something, think if you put their hourly rate in, I am quite sure they could have paid this lady three times over.

I will get off my high horse about that one, but I have been trying for a long time to get this poor lady some funding, of what it would have cost to go to Hobart, irrespective of the Melbourne trip, to no avail. I will not give up.

Helping younger people is something that the government does sincerely want to do. The MyHome shared equity scheme has helped a lot of first buyers into their own home and get onto the property ladder; in fact, 880 people who might not have otherwise had that chance.

Additionally, providing $10,000 in first-home buyer grants for Tasmanians purchasing or building a new home, I hope will help people take the leap from renting to owning. The only sad thing, if I talk from personal experience, was that if you had a first home buyer grant in a different state, you cannot also have it in Tasmania, which I learnt from experience with my son.
Savings of up to almost $29,000 on stamp duty is another measure.

These are all fantastic initiatives, and the government is earnestly and honestly trying to help young people and first-home buyers and builders to get into the property market.

I appreciate there are some difficult circumstances the government is needing to grapple with at the moment. Uncertain global economic conditions do reverberate into our own budget, and it has not been the easiest 10 years or so to have managed the state's economy. I understand that there are certain economical and financial realities that need to be managed and, in those circumstances, sometimes difficult decisions need to be made.

Tasmania is not the only state in the country facing a cost-of-living crisis. It is everywhere. It is in these moments you need to demonstrate you can properly make financial decisions and manage taxpayer money properly, that you will invest it in the things that need investment. The resources being put into health, education, emergency management and social services are well worth it. I appreciate that those policy areas are particularly difficult to manage. You also need to demonstrate you have the right priorities.

We have funds that are being poured into a stadium that some people may want and others do not. Or is it in the correct site? There are many questions that people have. We have high-priced consultants who are being paid hand over fist for shiny new reports that might not ever result in any new policies or tangible outcomes. We are paying to service levels of debt which we have never had before.

What future are we leaving our kids? A new football team, a new stadium will mean nothing to them if they are working harder and harder for a lower quality of life than their parents and grandparents had.

Thank you, I note the Budget.

[5.05 p.m.]
Mr EDMUNDS – Mr President, I welcome Mr Hiscutt, Casey, the new member for Montgomery, to the Legislative Council. This is a very strange and exciting time when you are new, but just strap in and enjoy it. As I said this morning, it is not often as you get older, things are new and exciting. Just embrace it. I think you will do really well. Also, I congratulate the member for Nelson on her win and thank people for their kind words to myself. It was quite a gruelling campaign, as they probably all are. I really want to thank my family, friends and the Labor Party for all their support over the years and indeed at the pointy end.

A lot of the issues we talked about during that campaign definitely have obviously touch points in this Budget. I think I said this last year also that it does kind of feel funny we give our hot take on the budget before we do the estimates. If I was in charge, perhaps I might do it the other way around because those Estimates would probably inform better contributions. Also, not that we are all into 'gotcha' politics; of course not. But why would you telegraph some of the stuff you might want to really get into the weeds of next week? However, we are where we are, so that is fine.

Housing is a huge issue and probably the number one issue coming up for myself. I look forward to Committee B being able to sit opposite the Minister for Housing and Planning, et cetera, and going through some of the good, the bad and the ugly in housing. Indeed, transport was a huge issue, whether that is roads, but also public transport. Mersey may still have their ferry, but certainly the ferry from Bellerive is very popular.

Cost of living is obviously always at the forefront of people's minds. I think they get sick of politicians talking about it, but it is not about one magic sort of wand to fix cost of living; it is each time something comes up, applying that lens to see how this is going to affect people's household budgets.

Health, obviously huge.

Education as well, which my committee will be dealing with. I am looking forward to getting some update on some of the infrastructure commitments that were certainly in my own electorate and other parts of the state people are very invested in.

Indeed, the other issue that came up was the football club and the stadium associated with that. My position on that is well and truly on the record from that campaign. What that showed, potentially, is that people are keen to see this club launch in this state and the infrastructure that comes with it. However, I am sure people who had an election exactly the same time as me are saying different things and got a similar outcome might have different views. Certainly, I think from the eastern shore the feedback was, if we keep saying no, will people stop bringing chequebooks to this state? There is a cost of saying no versus the cost of saying yes. There is a cost of saying yes, of course. I think there is support on the eastern shore. I was really heartened by, even on election night, when we were up at the Shoreline Hotel, there was a group of young, 18-19-year-olds who were in there partying with the faithful supporters and excited about what that result meant and sharing their stories. A few of them have just played their first senior game of footy, actually. I am not sure those guys will be tuned in to this broadcast, Mr President, but if they are, 'Hello'.

Mr Harriss - I am pretty sure.

Mr EDMUNDS - To the Budget itself, yes, as I have been watching on telly or in the Chamber, the numbers are really concerning for me, and I am sure for others, with $11 billion of debt, an interest bill set to hit $650 million every year. Those are sobering details and it was put that $650 million is enough to fund all our ambulance and emergency services. That is a huge chunk of the budget, just paying off interest.

Another issue, from my election, was certainly privatisation. Yes, with a couple of outliers, but it did unify people's opinions. People were telling me - it was not me telling them - that privatisation will lead to increased costs for services, jobs potentially going offshore, certainly interstate, or being lost, and that we will lose the dividends that help pay for our schools and hospitals for a short-term sugar hit.

We all saw the headlines after the Budget was handed down - you know, 'Age of Austerity', 'Bad Apple Isle', I actually hated to see it because it is a reflection on the entire state - and also Saul Eslake's warnings that there is now significant risk that our credit rating is downgraded and the impacts that will have on our budget going forward. We talk about that interest bill, it will only get worse. Even just the speculation about needing a federal bailout says a lot about how this state might be perceived in the future, if we actually need bailing out because we are in such bad shape.

That is why I think it is important - we can sit here and complain, but you have to be trying to put forward helpful suggestions as we go, such as moving things like what the Labor Party is talking about with needing the approval of two thirds of parliament if the dollars do not add up to what was projected.

In 2014, Tasmania had no net debt. In fact, as we keep hearing, there was $208 million in net cash and investments in the bank on 30 June 2014. Even three years ago, there was barely a billion dollars of debt, yet three years later, we are on a pathway towards $11 billion in net debt. The last three have been the three worst fiscal deficits in Tasmania's history.

I was tuned in to the Labor leader Dean Winter's budget reply downstairs, and this is quite sobering for me as well. If not for the one-off payment in 2017, the biggest cash surplus this century was $400 million and that was in 2004 under a Labor government. If you do the maths, it would take 27 consecutive years of the biggest surplus we have had this century to pay off the debt.

In the Budget, the numbers say that we will be spending less in 2029 than this year's Budget. I do not think anybody believes that. If it was true, that would mean a cut of 10 per cent to everything: schools, hospitals, police, emergency management, et cetera.

Things are not looking great. The Spirits are $500 million over budget and six years late. Last month, housing approvals were at record lows. They were the worst they had been, I think, for more than a decade. Since this state went into minority government, 7000 full-time jobs have been lost.

In the 2022 Budget, the government said this year it would produce an operating surplus of $126 million. The following year this was revised down to $32 million. The next year it was revised to a $148 million deficit. That deficit then doubled by the mid-year budget update, nearly doubled again with the election costings, and went further into the red $792 million in the 2024-25 Budget. Over the course of this year, it has blown out by another $500 million, to a deficit of nearly $1.3 billion. That is not what Tasmanians were promised.

I think we were talking a bit about participation rate. Today our participation rate is where the national rate was in 1983. The reason why our unemployment rate looks better than it actually is because people have given up looking for work altogether, with Tasmania having by far the worst employment participation rate in the nation. Young people, the people we need in this state as our population ages to provide all the services throughout health, education, allied health, building things, are leaving this state in record numbers, with net interstate migration losses recorded for nine consecutive quarters. I say this and people do not believe it, but on average, every four days another planeload of young people choose to leave this state.

We have crashed from the top of the CommSec ratings to near the bottom. Deloitte is projecting a recession, and this Budget predicts negative state final demand in - and Roy Morgan has found Tasmanian business confidence is clearly the lowest in the country.

I talked about privatisation. The thing that concerns people is if you privatise the MAIB, it is going to cost more to register your car. If you privatise Metro, it is going to cost more to catch the bus, and the services will get worse or disappear. Another concern I have with MAIB and the cost of living crisis, if premiums go up, people will stop registering their cars, and I think we all know what that means if they are involved in a crash. 
It is not just those sorts of GBEs that people were wrapping their heads around. Basically, every arm, including parts of Hydro, is still on the table. Our ports, Sustainable Timber Tasmania, Tasmanian Irrigation, et cetera, are all still for sale. Those companies provide the money that pays for our schools and hospitals. They also support thousands of jobs like good, secure, well-paid Tasmanian jobs across the state, not just in our cities.

Sustainable Timber Tasmania is not just about trees; it is about fire management. What happens there? Even this Budget contains $620 million of revenue from those businesses that are up for sale. We cannot have it both ways. It is a budget black hole.

I was tuned in this morning, as I said, to the leader's speech, and there was some policy stuff I would not mind putting on the record up here. Obviously, we spoke last year about the 10-point plan for budget repair. If it takes a decade to send a budget to the place it is going to be, it is going to take at least that to fix it and probably a lot longer.

Some of the things that were spoken about were backing private public partnership to deliver a northern convention centre; bringing together the resources of the Coordinator-General and ReCFIT into a new single entity, Invest Tasmania, based out of Launceston, and that is modelling an approach that has been proven to work in South Australia; giving Invest Tasmania a clear mandate and the powers it requires to unlock the $25 billion of capital that is ready to be invested in our state that might be stuck in planning rules and red tape. 

We talked about modernising our IT in our Health and other departments, and allowing for freer movement of public sector workers between departments, because we do have a great public service in this state; however, it may not be getting the instructions to fully achieve what it is capable of. That will also save money in recruitment and allow those roles, as I said, to be realigned to government priorities. 

Dean Winter spoke about a pilot to unlock child care in our regions, and this was specifically about the west coast, to unlock more economic activity. I think we can all remember this issue being raised when we went to Flinders Island on the member for McIntyre's electorate tour, that the access to childcare was a huge handbrake on people being able to work in that community and its regionalisation was a big problem. Piloting that on the west coast, hopefully up until another provider would take it over - but showing that the government can lead in that space, and I think that clearly our regional communities would all benefit from that.

It talked about getting rid of associate secretary roles and senior executive positions in the public service to save about $8 million per year. Some other savings were detailed around grants without competitive processes, cutting media advisers, et cetera - and working to defer the fifth lane on the Southern Outlet, and working with the federal government to reallocate that commitment to higher priority road projects, putting a hard cap on spending on consultants, government advertising and travel, which can save up to $6 million a year, based on blowouts from the last financial year. I think the interesting one that caught my eye was that $200,000 was given to write Tasmania's Trade Strategy. There is a whole section of State Growth dedicated to trade called Trade Tasmania. I think what it shows is that we have the people to do this work, but if we are addicted to outsourcing, then they are not going to do it.

We have an interesting week ahead of us next week, to go through this Budget. I am certainly looking forward to unpicking some of the detail and getting my head around where a lot of this is at, where the promises are at from previous years; what is being delivered and what is not, to provide the scrutiny that we need.

This Budget is headed to a pretty bad place for Tasmania if we are serious about ourselves being a state in this Commonwealth, while simultaneously people who have the respect of the economic communities are saying that a bailout is something that is legitimately on the table and not being laughed out of the room. That is pretty concerning to me. I will leave my remarks there.

I note the Budget.

[5.21 p.m.]
Mr DUIGAN (Windermere - Minister for Energy and Renewables) - Mr President, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak on the 2025-26 Tasmanian state Budget, a budget that demonstrates how the government is investing in our community, supporting Tasmanians with the things that matter such as cost of living, health, housing and building a better Tasmania now and for the future.

In challenging economic times - and we note those challenging economic times are in Tasmania and elsewhere around our country and the world - this Budget gets the balance right, continuing to invest in health, education and communities while keeping business strong. It creates jobs and supports families while backing business and our economy. It strives and, I believe, gets the balance right.

Understanding that cost-of-living pressures are impacting Tasmanians, it invests more than $550 million in relief measures and concessions, including $60 off power bills, half-price bus fares and expanding the Healthy School Lunch Program. We are also supporting Tasmanians into their first home with stamp duty relief, and keeping Tasmanians safe with $1.7 billion into police and emergency services.

We are doing this while continuing to invest in job-creating infrastructure projects. We know a strong economy and a strong future, underpinned by infrastructure investment, will deliver generational changes for our communities, just like we have seen with the recent opening of the Bridgewater Bridge. What a pleasure it was to drive across it on Monday morning. We are investing $3.5 billion over the next four years in infrastructure, new roads, bridges, schools and hospitals, to name but a few.

Across my electorate of Windermere, and my portfolios of Energy and Renewables, Sport and Events, and Parks, I am proud of the significant investments we have committed to in delivering what matters to Tasmanians: upgrading our schools and roads, community and sporting facilities; improving health and public transport services; creating clean, reliable and affordable energy for our future, and creating new industries and opportunities to grow our economy; supporting healthy, connected and creative communities through participation and engagement in sports and events, both locally and on the world stage; investing in our parks and reserves, so that both Tasmanians and visitors can enjoy what makes this part of the world so very special.

In the electorate of Windermere, I am pleased that the Budget includes infrastructure investments in the things that matter to those communities. As part of the $188 million school building blitz, we are upgrading primary schools at Mowbray Heights, with $7 million to be invested; Port Dalrymple School with $9.6 million invested. I was very pleased to be at South George Town Primary just the other day and the palpable excitement about a $15.1 million investment in that school and a very important piece of infrastructure in a growing community was great to see. Principal Brett Hay and his staff and the kids were buzzing.

We are also continuing to invest in the East Tamar Highway, in the Northern Regional Transit Centre and progressing new park-and-ride facilities. While based in Launceston, these will benefit the whole region with contemporary public transport options.

We are progressing works toward a second Tamar River bridge and improving safety on the Bridport Road.

We are also investing in health services in Launceston, which will benefit the whole region: expanding the emergency department at the Launceston General Hospital, developing a new Northern Mental Health Precinct and delivering the Northern Heart Centre. And someone who has had to fly interstate for that sort of treatment, very pleased to see that happen again - important long-term investments.

Keeping communities healthy also means supporting them to be fit and active and participating in local sports. It is also great, of course, for our mental health and keeping us connected. It is great for our kids, it is great for older people, and for our communities. That is why I am very pleased this Budget continues to invest in our sporting clubs and facilities, in particular, to deliver the Northern Suburbs Recreational Hub and upgrades to the Elphin Sports Centre.

The Budget ensures we continue to support our economy and industries to grow. A key example of this in my electorate in the Energy portfolio is through our $5 million investment over the next three years to support a Renewable Energy Services Hub at Bell Bay.

Bell Bay is the perfect location for the hub with its deepwater port, already established infrastructure and highly experienced and skilled workforce. There is a profound opportunity to be grasped at Bell Bay and northern Tasmania in terms of supporting not only our own aspirations for renewable energy, but also those that are being progressed by the Victorian government. We will have a role to play there and will also derive substantial investment from that piece of work. Our services hubs will take advantage of this working with the industry to attract investment and leverage those very valuable natural assets.

The Tasmanian government is continuing to deliver for Tasmanians, with $64.8 million invested for energy and renewable initiatives over the next four years. Our government's significant investment in renewables will create more jobs and ensure Tasmanians continue to have the lowest power prices in the nation.

Renewable energy generation is critical to our state's economy. Our energy system has always been a strong driver of economic growth within the state and now our strong renewable credentials will help set Tasmania up for a strong and prosperous future.

We are a 100 per cent net renewable jurisdiction - an impressive achievement not just on a national stage but also internationally.

This is a huge drawcard for new industries and businesses, helping to drive economic growth within the state. Tasmania, a pioneer in the hydro power development and continued investment in our existing system will be a key providing low cost, reliable and clean energy.

Of course, we cannot forget the significant planned private sector investment in wind and solar generation projects which are critical to support our renewable energy agenda.

Reflecting on the quality of our wind resources, developers have identified over 7 gigawatts of installed capacity, representing billions of dollars of investment in our state, aiming to commence commercial operation by the end of 2030.

Some of these projects include large-scale wind farms in Bell Bay Wind Farm Project, Whaleback Ridge, Northeast Wind, Robbins Island and St Patricks Plains, along with large-scale solar projects at Connorville, Dungrove Farm and Bell Bay. Combined, these energy sector investments represent some of the largest infrastructure investments in this state's history.

Many of these project proponents will be gathering this week in Devonport for the seventh annual Tasmanian Energy Development Conference, and as minister, I look forward to hearing from them on key insights in order to keep this exciting pipeline moving.

One of the things we have heard from proponents over the journey is the need to streamline the approvals process and provide certainty as early as possible for developers, a quick yes or no. We want to enable to see more energy generation coming online sooner. That is why we are delivering a new streamlined approvals case management process through the Renewable Energy Approval Pathway. Across four years, we have committed $14.4 million into ensuring new energy proponents have the support they need to navigate the necessary approvals process. This will not only unlock billions of dollars in investment but will also support our ambitious target to double our renewable energy generation by 2040 - of course with the climate impact that that will have for this state and others. We are committed to ensuring that Tasmania is one of the simplest places to invest for renewable energy proponents.

Tasmania's reputation as a renewable energy powerhouse means we are ideally positioned to take advantage of opportunities to create jobs and future industries. This includes the development of new industries like green hydrogen. Our vision to be a global leader in large-scale green hydrogen production by 2030 is detailed in our Tasmanian Renewable Hydrogen Action Plan. I am very pleased to report we are currently producing green hydrogen at Lutana and that is a really important first step. That will be further realised through our green hydrogen hub at Bell Bay supported by $11.9 million in the Budget continues delivering on this with ZEN Energy. I was pleased on Saturday to announce ZEN Energy as the lead proponent for the hub. The hub is expected to create around 740 direct and indirect jobs and will drive economic growth in our northern regions and across the state more broadly. In the future, the hub will be a precinct of industry and businesses all engaged in producing and using hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives. It is a project we are continuing to deliver through this year's Budget.

Also included in the Budget is a $300 million contingent to progress Project Marinus, should a positive final investment decision be reached. Project Marinus will unlock further energy generation opportunities and ensure Tasmania is recognised for its impressive renewable energy capabilities, and we are coming closer to that decision point for Project Marinus and the opportunity that it represents. 

The TCCI recognises the importance of Project Marinus for Tasmania's future, with the CEO, Michael Bailey, stating that the continued support for an investment in Marinus and the North West Transmission Developments is helping to unlock billions of dollars of investment, create jobs and drive economic growth, which will ultimately help with budget repair. I guess that is the story: to grow the economy, to grow the pie.

The Tasmanian government's 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future takes action right now on the things that matter to Tasmania and makes life more affordable. We acknowledge the rising cost-of-living challenges faced by many Tasmanians. That is why our renewable energy dividend will be contributing $60 to every Tasmanian household's power bill and that is underpinned by the notion that when Hydro Tasmania makes money, Tasmanian households save money. That RED - or Renewable Energy Dividend - policy is a sensible and a sustainable measure that will continue to deliver real and tangible value to Tasmanians for years to come.

The 2025-26 Budget ensures economic growth alongside sensible debt management and continues to provide a business-friendly investment environment by cutting red tape, with no new or increased taxes.

We know sport and active recreation play a vital role in improving both our physical and mental health and are equally critical to building community connection and social purpose. The Tasmanian Government is committed to ensuring more Tasmanians, regardless of their age or their background, have the opportunity to be active and have somewhere to play the sports that they love. 

We continue to work with our sporting organisations to provide safe, inclusive and fun opportunities for all Tasmanians to participate in sport and active recreation opportunities of their choice.

The Budget includes significant and important funding for sport and active recreation, which will continue to deliver on the government's commitment that more Tasmanians are able to get active with support through the continuation of the $100 Ticket to Play and the second round of the highly successful pilot Ticket to Wellbeing program for eligible older Tasmanians.

The Tasmanian Active Infrastructure Grants Program has been allocated $5 million over two years to provide grants to the sports and active recreation sector to build new, and upgrade existing, sport and recreation infrastructure. Our commitment to our very own Tasmanian AFL and AFLW club, the Tassie Devils, is unwavering. We know this opportunity will be transformational for our state and for generations to come, and we are delivering on our commitment to set the club up for success to strongly represent this proud foundation football state.

To this end, I am excited about the opportunity to help unlock the full potential of the Kingborough Sports Precinct, transforming it into one of Tasmania's premier sport and recreation hubs. Serving over 30 organisations, it is poised to become a key destination not only for the local community, but for the broader Tasmanian population as well. With major investments from the Tasmanian government, including the development of the JackJumpers High Performance Training Centre and the AFL High Performance Centre, the precinct is set to become a cornerstone of sporting and community excellence.

This government is investing $130 million in community sporting clubs and infrastructure right across the state. This includes further upgrades to Dial Park, the new Northern Suburbs Community Recreation Hub, Elphin Sports Centre, Glenorchy Sports Centre, increased capacity at the Devonport Oval Sports Complex precinct and improved additional facilities for community venues such as the Penguin Sports and Services Club, Valley Road Regional Football Club, and, I should say, myriad other sporting clubs across the state.

The Tasmanian government is working to increase the participation and involvement of women and girls in all aspects of sport and active recreation as participants, coaches, leaders, officials, volunteers and administrators. To achieve this, we are developing a women and girls in sports strategy, enabling greater access and participation of women and girls in sport and active recreation in Tasmania. I was really pleased to talk to James Sutherland, CEO of Golf Australia, today, about progressing the Women in Golf charter.

The Tasmanian Institute of Sport continues to successfully support talented Tasmanian athletes to develop their sporting potential and compete successfully at the national and international level, including the Olympic, Paralympic and Commonwealth Games. That is why we are investing $1.5 million for the Talent ID for 2032 program. This program was created to uncover and support local sporting talent with the aim of developing athletes for the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games with access to organised sport opportunities. It should not depend on where you live. I was really pleased to see the great success of Tasmanian athletes at the Launceston Running Festival over the course of the weekend, which is now, I believe, the second-highest ranked half marathon in the Southern Hemisphere. Supporting our athletes and providing elite competition is important.

Programs such as Reclink are doing fantastic work in our communities, particularly in southern Tasmania, by providing access to sporting competition for young people who might not otherwise have the chance to participate. I am pleased that this year's budget includes an additional $450,000 over three years to enable the team to strengthen and continue this important work.

Members who were at the luncheon today with the Tourism Industry Council Tasmania (TICT) would have heard Margy Osmond, CEO of the Tourism & Transport Forum Australia, talk about the power of the events sector to drive our visitor economy. We know, here in the state, how important events are to that part of our economy. I think one in six Tasmanians' work is supported by our visitor economy, so it is a super important area of focus for the government. The Tasmanian government has always been a strong supporter of the events sector, providing funding to attract, retain and grow events that drive that economic growth, tourism and jobs in every region of the state. Not only are events a trigger for people to travel to Tasmania, we know they also significantly boost the tourism and hospitality sector in every corner of the state because of that dispersal effect that they have. The Tasmanian government will provide more than $29.6 million across events with an existing agreement.

We are proud to support those iconic events and in the lead-up to Dark Mofo and as we reflect on a hugely successful Wooden Boat Festival, and continue to support elite content across AFL, basketball and motorsports, I would say there has been great success. Symmons Plains was a huge success this year with the V8s. Importantly, for every dollar invested by the Tasmanian government in events, on average $6 is returned into the Tasmanian community. During the last financial year alone, 156,000 people were estimated to visit Tasmania, primarily to attend an event supported by Events Tasmania and that is a lot of people. This is an increase of more than 43,000 visitors from the previous year. We know people who visit Tasmania for events generally stay longer, spend more and explore our regions, contributing to the economic growth, social fabric, and to the pride and vibrancy of our communities.

Another key driver of our visitor economy is Tasmania's natural environment and our unique flora and fauna, which is so well showcased in our state's parks and reserves. Our parks are an essential part of the Tasmanian way of life. That is why we are continuing to invest in our natural landscapes and amenities, to deliver not only outstanding experiences but to protect and conserve the reserve estate. As a government, this is something we are very proud of. 

What we know is that the Overland Track and the Three Capes Track continue to be major drawcards. That is why we are investing $40 million to deliver the Next Iconic Walk in the Tyndall Range. We know that 80 per cent of people who participate in the Three Capes come from interstate or overseas. It is a huge drawcard for the state and the delivery of this new multi-day walk will drive economic and social benefits for both the west coast community and the state more broadly. The new walk will also add to our suite of world-class walking experiences that attract visitors to Tasmania, encouraging them to stay in our state longer and spend more.

The Budget recognises how our government is focused on ensuring the Parks and Wildlife Service is on a sustainable footing with an additional $8 million per year over the forward estimates in operational funding. I am very pleased that is included in the Budget and that is recognition of the increased cost of doing business for the Parks department. Wages, insurance, fuel and contractor costs have all increased. We have also shown our ongoing commitments to Parks with a substantial $44 million investment to ensure our parks and reserves continue to be upgraded, accessible and safe. That is another way of saying that we are committing to our maintenance responsibilities.

We are also investing in sustainable platforms to ensure that visitors to Tasmania are contributing towards the services they utilise. This includes the rollout of pay and display machines, making it easier for visitors and locals to purchase Parks Passes and pay for camping fees with every dollar being reinvested into the reserve estate. The pay and display machines have been a great success, with park fees substantially up over a normal year, showing that people want to buy their Parks Passes, they want do the right thing, and having an easy method for them to do it is a good thing.

We will continue to deliver other initiatives in recognition that accessing services is key to planning family holidays and visitor experiences. This includes the $2 million funding commitment to deliver the statewide Parks online booking system, which is planned to come online in 2026. We recognise sustainable tourism growth requires careful management, which is why we are also delivering a significant capital investment program as a part of our 2030 strong plan.
Over the next year, we will see construction commence on key capital projects right across the state, including the Mt Field Concourse, improved amenities at Cockle Creek and upgrades in the north of the state at Ben Lomond National Park and The Nut State Reserve, which are being delivered right now. We have also recently released the West Coast Off-Road Vehicle Strategy, to guide our $10 million investment into the Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area and broader west coast region. This project is already underway with $900,000 in improvements and shack node roads in the APCA and the new Cassiterite Creek Bridge. With works continuing over the year ahead, we will continue to deliver sustainable management outcomes for existing tracks and improve the recreational experience for users and visitors, while protecting those important heritage areas.

We recognise the global significance of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. We want to ensure it is experienced, celebrated and shared with the world. We have delivered three critical biosecurity threat mitigations through the deer cull program, which includes ongoing monitoring, using sentinel cameras, to inform of any deer moving back into the TWWHA from neighbouring land. Our biosecurity program will continue to focus on invasive species threats, including not only deer monitoring as discussed, but also feral cat distribution and weed control in the TWWHA. 

Our government continues to manage the TWWHA, on behalf of the Australian Government and the world, in a way that respects its natural and cultural heritage values. I have recently written to the new Environment minister, Senator Watt, to encourage the Australian Government to lift their level of funding and contribute additional wherewithal through our partnership to protect this globally significant landscape; I would encourage any members who feel the urge to help in that effort.

Our investments right across the state drive Tasmania's economy. Another important project in my portfolio, as part of Land Tasmania, is the All Hazards Spatial Infrastructure Project, with a contract awarded to a Tasmanian company to deliver the new platform. Our $2.75 million commitment to this important project will modernise and uplift the already very significant capabilities of the Land Information System Tasmania (theLIST), to deliver spatial infrastructure and services to government, emergency service organisations, industry and, of course, the Tasmanian community. TheLIST is a really impressive piece of digital infrastructure. It has a lot of functionality if you see it in the hands of somebody who knows what they are doing. 

The Budget also continues to support the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens with over $500,000 of additional funding for infrastructure upgrades to the conservatory and historic Eardley-Wilmot Wall, which is in addition to the $7.6 million project that is delivering enhanced visitor amenities, including accessibility improvements. This investment is in recognition of the gardens being Australia's second-oldest botanic gardens with a long-standing position in the world network of botanic gardens, attracting almost half a million visitors every year. We are committed to sustainable management, balancing protection with sharing our unique places with Tasmanians and the world now and into the future. 

In conclusion, there is a lot to be excited about in the Budget. Our government believes in keeping our economy strong and while we are taking a sensible path to surplus, now is not the time for governments to withdraw investments in projects that continue to employ Tasmanians and keep businesses alive. This is why this Budget continues to invest in infrastructure while delivering the services that matter to Tasmanians, such as health, education and housing.

The Budget is balanced and strives to ensure economic growth while charting a sensible path to surplus, delivering on the things that matter to Tasmanians. As a government, we are funding what matters and building a better Tasmania now and for the future. I congratulate the Treasurer on the 2025-26 Budget and look forward to delivering for the people of Windermere and the people of Tasmania. Thank you. I note the Budget.

[5.49 p.m.]
Ms LOVELL (Rumney) - Mr President, as others have done, I would like to begin my contribution by acknowledging our new member in the Chamber, the member for Montgomery, and also our returned members, the member for Pembroke and the member for Nelson. We have all been through elections. We know what it is like. It is not easy. We have had three strong results. I am pleased to see the member for Nelson and the member for Pembroke both returned strongly by their electorates. I think it also shows a level of engagement with the Legislative Council that we might not have seen in previous years, and it is something that I feel quite strongly about. For the new member for Montgomery, welcome to the Chamber. I hope you enjoy your time here. It is a lot to take in, but one of the things I think I learned when I arrived is that whilst it looks very formal, it is actually a really lovely place to be. People are pretty relaxed about all the formalities, and nobody here knows much more than you. We rely very heavily on the excellent staff that we have. I am sure you will enjoy your time here and do your community proud.

I rise to note the Budget, acknowledging, as many of us do every year actually, that the process is a little backward. We do this now, but without really having had the opportunity to properly scrutinise the Budget through our Estimates process. I know the member for Pembroke mentioned that earlier and other members have said the same, and I think we say it every year. I agree with the member for Pembroke that there is no doubt that many of us would have a lot more to say if we were to do that first, and maybe that is why we do it this way. 

Ms Rattray - I had not thought of that. 

Ms LOVELL - I think it could be perhaps a more worthwhile process if we had the opportunity to sit through Estimates and properly interrogate the budget papers and have an opportunity to sit down face to face with ministers before we deliver these contributions on what is a really important document. We have a process, and we will follow up and we will see how we go.

I feel like we have been waiting for this Budget for a few years now. We have been waiting for a budget every year. We kind of expected the Budget is going to be really bad. Every year so far, they have managed to cobble together something that really hid the true extent of the state of the budget for the last couple of years; but there is always only so long you can do that for before people start to see through it. I feel like this year they have given up trying to hide it, and it is all there in black and white for everyone to see. That is how it feels to me, that it seems like that is where we are at now. We are here. The government has given up trying to hide how bad things are. It is right there in the papers in black and white for all of us to see. 

I cannot help but feel that that is a little symbolic of the government as a whole. They really seem to have given up. We did not return to parliament this year until March. Our Chamber did not return to parliament until 11 March, so not even the beginning of March. By the time Easter and the school holidays had come around, where we typically have a break, people and staff have children at home. Easter is a time in Tasmania that most of us take with our families. By the time Easter and the school holidays had come around, we had only sat in this place for three weeks. It was not until almost the end of May that we came back, very nearly five months of the year - in fact, it was very close to the end of May - five months of the year, and the Legislative Council had sat for three weeks.

Where is the government's agenda? We know there is plenty we could be getting on with. There are certainly plenty of promises that the government has made, and are yet to deliver, that require legislative change. I know legislation is only one part of what we do, and it is only one part of what the government does, but it is a critical part. It is really what we are here to do.

There are plenty of promises that have been made: a short-stay levy; a ban on conversion practices; a single statewide planning scheme. If they are really looking for something, there are recommendations from the Cox review into the Integrity Commission. They have been waiting since 2016. That is almost as long as the government has been in.

It is not like we do not have work to be getting on with, provided the government do their bit, but they just do not seem that interested this year. They have just given up on trying to hide how bad the state of the budget is as well. In the 2022 Budget, the Liberals said that this year, 2024-25, there would be an operating surplus of $126 million. The next year in the first Budget of the Rockliff Liberal government, that was revised down, and the budget forecast a $32 million surplus. The next year it was revised down again, this time to $148 million deficit. By the midyear budget update, the deficit had doubled, and by the 2024-25 Budget, the Rockliff government had gone further into the red: $792 million. Now, over the course of just of the last year, it has blown out by another $500 million to a deficit of nearly $1.3 billion. These things do not happen overnight. They do not happen over the course of six months or even a year, but sooner or later, you need to start being honest about it and that is where we are at now. This Premier is the worst budget manager we have seen. Premier Rockliff's three years as Premier have delivered the three biggest deficits in history, and they have given up even trying to hide it.

Other members have outlined better than I could the ongoing impact of higher debt and higher debt servicing. I have never been a numbers expert, but anyone can understand the more debt you have, the more you spend in paying it back. That money that will go towards paying back the debt this government has racked up is money that otherwise could be put to better use in health care, in education, in housing - all areas the government has made promises in that are yet to be realised. We hear claims of pathways to surplus but there is no pathway. Tasmanians are not stupid. They cannot be expected to believe that, after years of worsening debt, all of a sudden with no explanation of how the government will turn things around. It is nonsense and Tasmanians know it is.

This government does have a pathway for something. It is not a surplus, but they have a pathway to sell off Tasmania's assets, our government-owned businesses: Metro, MAIB, TasNetworks, Aurora, Momentum Energy, Sustainable Timbers Tasmania, Tasmanian Irrigation, all on the chopping block. These are services that Tasmanians rely on and that the government has an obligation to provide. There is a very good reason that services that people rely on should be provided by the government, the caretakers of the state, without motivation to cut costs or make profits, without shareholders expecting dividends. We have seen privatisation agendas from governments around the country before and there is not a single example that anyone can point to where this has resulted in better services and lower costs. I know this government is afraid of numbers, but it is pretty straightforward.

The government has a pathway to cutting public service jobs, two-and-a-half thousand jobs. Not only is that two-and-a-half thousand jobs in providing the services we all rely on, and we know what impact that will have in services that are already stretched beyond breaking point and have been for some time, but it is workers who are living here in our communities and contributing to the economy, sending their kids to school here, spending their money here. Job cuts are not necessarily a direct equivalent saving to the budget when you take these things into account. Job cuts will not put the budget into a better position in the long run. We already have the lowest workforce participation rate in the country. Policies like this will only make things worse.

I feel like my contribution has been full of doom and gloom. I have deliberately kept it short for that reason, because I do not entirely feel comfortable with that, but I think that is just where we are. Budget estimates will provide a better opportunity, as it does every year, for more detailed scrutiny of the Budget, and I do look forward to that. I do genuinely enjoy that process. But I cannot help but feel pretty disheartened about where we go from here. That sentiment is reflected in my community and in the community more broadly.

For a lot of years there has been a bit of a sense of a willingness to give the government a chance. People wanted to believe what they were being told; that things would turn around. But it is clear now that is no longer believable, and the mood has changed. Perhaps people are feeling what I am feeling in here, that the government has given up.

Mr President, I note the Budget.

[5.59 p.m.]
Ms PALMER (Rosevears - Acting Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I rise today to present the second budget of the re-elected Rockliff Liberal government. This is a budget that delivers on our commitments and continues to implement our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future. This Budget backs business, creates jobs, supports families and builds stronger, safer communities. It invests in the things that matter to Tasmanians: cost of living, health, education, public safety and housing. It builds an even better Tasmania now and for the future.

Tasmania's economy is strong and continuing to grow. It is now valued at more than $40.6 billion. Since we came to government, gross state product has increased by $8.9 billion, representing a 26 per cent rise. We have the strongest wage growth in the country and the highest level of business confidence. As the Treasurer has stated, despite the challenges of recent years, Tasmania's economy is strong and growing. Our level of debt remains manageable and is necessary to ensure we continue to support jobs, back business and industry and grow the economy. We remain on track to deliver a net operating surplus by 2029-30. This is a sensible and responsible pathway to surplus, but we want to do even better. Our goal is to return to surplus earlier than projected and that is why this Budget reflects an ambitious reform agenda.
It includes three key initiatives. First, it recognises that a strong economy is essential to everything we aim to deliver as a government. The most effective way to support a strong economy is to back business, and this is exactly what we are doing. We have rolled out reforms to make Tasmania's planning approvals easier, faster and more affordable. We have intensified our efforts to cut red tape, support small business and streamline the processes that Tasmanian businesses and organisations must navigate.

Secondly, we are working closely with the public service to review government programs. We are identifying what is no longer a priority, what can be done better and how we can deliver more productively. The Efficiency and Productivity Unit is supporting agencies to find improvements, ensuring we have a public service that is the right size, the right shape, in the right place and equipped with the tools needed to deliver for Tasmania. We are committed to spending taxpayers' money wisely. That is what Tasmanians expect and it is what they deserve.

Thirdly, we are progressing the most significant reform of government businesses in decades. This is a true Team Tasmania approach. We are ensuring that government businesses engage more directly with the private sector and the community. Their role is to deliver services to Tasmania at the lowest sustainable cost, while also contributing to our economic growth.

As Minister for Education, this is a budget that places education at the centre of our vision for a stronger, fairer Tasmania. Since becoming education minister last year, I have made over 120 visits to our schools and Child and Family Learning Centres around the state, and I am proud to say that this Budget is building a better education system for Tasmanian children now and for the future. We understand that education is the single most powerful driver of social and economic opportunity. A strong education system delivers better jobs, healthier communities, safer streets and a more prosperous state. This Budget delivers record investment in Tasmanian education for our nearly 57,000 learners from kindergarten to year 12 and our education portfolio workforce of over 11,000 Tasmanians. More than $2 billion will be spent next year alone for this portfolio, with that investment delivering for our schools, students, teachers and libraries across the state. We are lifting literacy rates, supporting students with disability, and upgrading school infrastructure in every region.

We heard loud and clear through the independent review of education in Tasmania that our Lifting Literacy strategy is working. Through this Budget we are backing our schools to continue on this transformative journey by providing an additional $12 million to supercharge literacy resources. We are continuing to provide support for our growing cohort of students with disability with an additional $10 million in targeted funding made available. As Minister for Education and Minister for Disability Services, it is these commitments to improvements for our children that unlock the opportunity for all Tasmanian children to reach their full potential. Twenty-three schools from around the state are included in our $297 million investment in education infrastructure over the next four years. This investment also includes our $10 million playground and sports courts upgrade program, a large proportion of our $15 million teacher residence upgrade program, development of our four new Child and Family Learning Centres and nearly $20 million towards our VET Facilities Fund, delivering modern, fit-for-purpose vocational education and training facilities and industry-standard equipment for our secondary schools, colleges and trade training centres.

This is a budget for young Tasmanians. It is a budget that sets them up to succeed, not just in school but in life; but education does not exist in isolation, and that is why we continue to invest in the essential services that wrap around schools and families. We are investing nearly half a billion dollars in housing through Homes Tasmania, helping more Tasmanians into safe and secure homes. We are providing $942 million in health funding to meet rising demand and strengthen our health system, including expanded services in mental health, elective surgery and pharmacy-based care. We are also investing in community safety with more resources for police and new rehabilitation programs to help break cycles of offending.

Having now held the portfolio of Minister for Disability Services for several years, I can say without a doubt we have had the most significant year of disability reform at a state level as we introduced and passed the Disability Rights, Inclusion and Safeguarding Act 2024. This nation-leading reform will be a game changer for our Tasmanian disability community and taking the bill for this act through this Chamber was undoubtedly one of my proudest moments. I know what this act means to our disability community because they told us, sharing their experiences and what they wanted to see for a better future for Tasmanians living with disability. For over two years we consulted with them, and we worked with them right to the very end, to ensure we were delivering what they asked for. 

A key measure of the act is the establishment of a Disability Commissioner, something that Tasmanians living with disabilities strongly advocated for. Ms Catherine Whitington commenced in the role of Tasmanian Disability Commissioner on 12 May 2025. Ms Whitington brings a wealth of experience to this role, including as Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Health and Community Services Complaints Commissioner, and as an advocate of the Office of the Guardian for Children and Young People in South Australia. Importantly, Ms Whitington brings experience to the role as a person with disability and will apply both her professional and personal experiences to this critical role.

In this year's Budget, we continue to provide essential funding for our disability community, and this includes support for Tasmanians living with disability, including those on the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), through our continued bilateral agreement with the Commonwealth. This year, Tasmania's cash contribution to the NDIS is just over $287 million, delivering specialist disability supports to people with permanent and significant disability needs. This is also inclusive of the state's contribution to the Information, Linkages and Capacity Building Program that provides funding to organisations to support people with disability, regardless of whether or not they are NDIS participants.

There is also $11.8 million for the disability services portfolio, including support for the establishment of the Office of the Disability Commissioner and the senior practitioner. This funding also continues to support disability advocacy peak bodies such as Advocacy Tasmania; Speak Out; The Association for Children with Disability; and funding to National Disability Services as the peak body for disability service organisations across Tasmania.

We also provide continuity of support for people who are eligible under the current Tasmanian disability act but not eligible for the NDIS. Additionally, disability services continue to support a range of reform activities through this Budget, including responding to the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability, the NDIS Review and Australia's Disability Strategy.

Having held the portfolios of Women and the Prevention of Family Violence, albeit as separate portfolios, it is a privilege to be back in this role, now combined under the one portfolio. Combining the portfolio allows us to have holistic focus on gender equality, economic participation and women's safety. One of the greatest joys of being an elected representative is the opportunity to meet truly extraordinary Tasmanians from all walks of life.

As the Minister for Women and the Prevention of Family Violence, I have had the good fortune of meeting some of the most fierce, passionate and capable women who have given so much to our state, or who have overcome incredible challenges as they continue to speak up and speak out for a better Tasmania for us all.

Our funding this year of over $22 million continues to support women from all walks of life. I am proud to have secured a doubling of the International Women's Day Small Grants Program to $40,000 per year, over the next four years. This investment will ensure even more community-driven celebrations to advance gender equality, as part of International Women's Day, which will be supported across the state. The importance of supporting these community events cannot be underestimated. This program has long been oversubscribed, and I am thrilled we are giving the opportunity for more initiatives to be held across the state, whether they be in Forth or Flinders Island, Dunalley or Devonport, Beauty Point or Battery Point.

This Budget also sees us continue to invest in the economic future of Tasmanian women, particularly those seeking to take on leadership positions. It is a priority of our government and a priority of mine to reduce barriers to women's economic participation and support the advancement of women across all areas of our economy.

A women's leadership scholarship program, funded in this year's Budget and the forward estimates for $100,000 per year, has for a number of years delivered leadership and board skills training to women across Tasmania. To date, over 200 women have participated in this program designed to address barriers to women's leadership participation. I would like to share some feedback from a scholarship participant on her experience in last year's program:

Receiving the scholarship to attend this program was a privilege and I feel incredibly fortunate to have been part of such an inspiring and empowering experience. Over the course of three days, I joined a fabulous group of 45 women from male-dominated industries, all of whom brought unique perspectives and experiences to the room. The Leading Together Program has left me feeling inspired and better equipped to contribute to my field. As a mother of an 18-year-old heading into the workforce next year, I only wish I could have taken her with me to learn these invaluable skills. I believe the lessons from this program could be transformative for young women like her.

I have also attended a number of events around the state in recent weeks that have served as a reminder that while governments play a key role in ensuring women's ongoing participation in the workforce, so too does the private sector. Just last month, I stood in a room full of women in mining, manufacturing and energy who were recent graduates of the GEMS Program, run by the Tasmanian Minerals, Manufacturing and Energy Council (TMEC). GEMS is an acronym for Growth, Empowerment, Management and Selfcare, and provides industry connections and support for women who have stepped into non-traditional roles in these industries. The room was full of clever, ambitious and focused women who want to be successful at their jobs, whatever success may look like for them.

We know that no matter how we may look to support gender equality initiatives, true gender equality cannot be achieved without the eradication of family and sexual violence. In this Budget, we continue our investment in implementation of our Third Action Plan, providing $12.5 million in the 2025-26 year. We are almost at the halfway point, and we are on target to achieve each action by completion of the plan in 2027.

Key recent achievements include: establishing our multidisciplinary Arch Centres in the north and south, providing survivor-centred and integrated responses, and a third Arch Centre in the north-west will open later this year, which is just brilliant; establishing the Tasmanian Family and Sexual Violence Alliance as the peak body for the sector to improve coordination of services and support policy development; and establishing Tasmania's first Victim-Survivor Advisory Council to provide an ongoing voice to government. I had the privilege of attending the council's very first meeting late last year, which was incredibly moving.

There is also around $4.5 million in recurrent core funding for our specialist service providers and a further $5 million as part of our national partnership agreement with the Commonwealth. This includes over $2.6 million for the 500 community sector and frontline worker initiative. I am pleased to share that we have recently become only the second jurisdiction in Australia to meet our target under the 500 Workers Initiative of 26.4 FTE additional commenced by 30 June 2025.

I am proud to speak about the region I represent, the electorate of Rosevears, and the transformative infrastructure and community commitments provided for my electorate within this Budget. One of the most significant new projects is the construction of a new ambulance station at Legana. Legana is one of Tasmania's fastest-growing areas and with that growth comes the responsibility to ensure essential services keep pace. The new Legana ambulance station will be a dedicated, contemporary and purpose-built ambulance station that will house all of Ambulance Tasmania's requirements, with capacity for future expansion of services. This investment will reduce response times, ease pressure on existing facilities and deliver emergency care closer to home for thousands of residents. It is about ensuring families in Legana, Grindelwald and surrounding areas can rest easier, knowing help is not that far away.

Anyone who travels through northern Tasmania knows the East and West Tamar highways are vital arteries, not only for locals but for business, for farmers, for our tourists and for freight. As provided within this Budget, we are upgrading both highways, improving safety, efficiency and resilience. We are also upgrading intersections throughout Riverside and along the Frankford Road. These upgrades will make a difference, reducing accidents, saving lives and giving confidence to every road user.

As our region grows, so too does the need for smarter, more efficient transport solutions. That is why we are progressing new park and ride facilities and delivering the new Launceston Regional Transit Facility, with benefits that will flow directly into the Rosevears electorate. These initiatives mean fewer cars on our roads, reduced emissions and more convenience for commuters, including those in Riverside, Trevallyn and Legana, and across the West Tamar, who work or study in central Launceston. They are also about equity, ensuring that people in regional and outer suburban areas have just as much access to opportunity, education and employment as anyone else in the state.

These are not just projects on a spreadsheet, they are meaningful investments in the quality of life for the people of Rosevears. They are about listening to what our communities need - safer roads, better schools, accessible transport and faster emergency care - and delivering practical results. They are about supporting growth while preserving the character and charm that make Rosevears such as special place to live, to work and to raise our families. They reflect the values of the people I represent: fairness, forward thinking and a deep care for our community.

This Budget responds to the real pressures faced by Tasmanian families. It provides targeted cost-of-living relief, including power bill support, half-price school bus fares and food-relief programs. It delivers economic confidence. It backs small business, drives investment in infrastructure, supports regional development and builds on Tasmania's strength in renewable energy and tourism.

Importantly, this Budget charts a sensible and responsible pathway to surplus. There are no new or increased taxes. At its heart, this is a Budget about opportunity. It invests in the future skills, knowledge and wellbeing of our people. It gives our children the tools they need to build a better Tasmania.
