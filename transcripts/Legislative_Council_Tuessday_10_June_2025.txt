SUPPLY BILL (No. 1) 2025 (No. 32)

Second Reading

[2.31 p.m.]
Ms PALMER (Rosevears - Acting Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, as is standard practice, when appropriation acts for the forthcoming budget year will not be in place at the commencement of the budget year, a supply bill is required to make interim provision for the appropriation of funding from the public account for the continuation of normal government services until the budget appropriation bills are enacted.

Supply bills are a contingency measure consistent with longstanding constitutional and fiscal conventions. The supply bills support the continued delivery of existing services on a same-policy basis as the 2024-25 appropriation acts (2024-25 budget and supplementary appropriations). As such, no new initiatives, capital projects or equity contributions (2025-26 policy decisions) are provided for by the Supply Bill.

The amount of appropriation included in the supply bills reflects Treasury's estimate of the level of funding required by agencies to continue the normal services of government for a period of up to six months from 1 July 2025 to 31 December 2025.

This level of funding provides budget flexibility. The draft 2025 supply bills seek parliament's approval for interim appropriations to ensure the continued operation of government services from 1 July 2025 until the enactment of the annual appropriation bills.

Treasury estimates that an appropriation totalling $4.613 billion is required to enable the continuation of the normal services of government, including services in respect of parliamentary and statutory offices, for a period of up to six months from 1 July 2025 to 31 December 2025. This amount has been determined with reference to actual agency expenditure for the first six months of 2024-25, and the 2025-26 budget Estimates.

In accordance with current appropriation conventions, two supply bills have been prepared. The bills reflect the allocation of agency outputs to ministerial portfolios detailed in the 2025-26 budget papers and as such are consistent with the 2025 appropriation bills. Methodology for calculating the amount of operating services appropriation reflects actual operating expenditure at the output or agency level for the first six months of 2024-25 as a percentage of the 2024-25 budget appropriation for those outputs or agencies. This percentage is then applied to the 2025-26 budget Estimates as an output level as presented in the 2025-26 budget papers to determine the base amount for the supply appropriation. The supply bills mirror the agency portfolio and output structure used in the 2025-26 appropriation bills.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=11.8_D=27.1_C=0.87] Supply amounts calculated based on the percentage of actual operating expenditure at an agency level include the Departments of Health; Justice; Police, Fire and Emergency Management; Premier and Cabinet; and State Growth. For capital services appropriation, the estimates reflect six-twelfths of the 2025-26 budget Estimates at project output level [Bookmark: Phr4_O=39.3_D=17.5_C=0.89] , excluding new capital projects. This differing methodology for the calculation of capital appropriation requirements reflects that there are often significant differences in the profile of individual capital projects on a year-to-year basis.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=60.5_D=29.4_C=0.88] Supply Bill (No. 1) 2025 makes an interim provision for the appropriation of $4,583,400,000 for the services of the government. This includes $4,273,700,000 for expenditure on operating services. A further $309.7 million is provided for expenditure for capital services to allow the government [Bookmark: Phr6_O=90.0_D=27.7_C=0.78] 's infrastructure program to continue to be delivered in the new budget year.

Supply Bill (No. 2) 2025 makes an interim provision for the appropriation of $27.7 million for the services of the government in respect of parliamentary and statutory offices for operating services expenditure. A further $1.9 million is provided for capital services for infrastructure expenditure.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=118.3_D=8.4_C=0.76] Once the appropriation acts are passed, the supply acts cease to have effect for the purposes of authorising expenditure. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=128.9_D=23.8_C=0.81]  The funds previously authorised under the supply acts are subsumed into the broader appropriations, with any unspent amounts reconciled within the full-year appropriations. These supply bills are administrative in nature as they provide for the continued provision of existing government services and capital expenditure [Bookmark: Phr9_O=153.2_D=6.5_C=0.82]  pending parliament's consideration of the Budget for the 2025-26 financial year.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=160.9_D=20.9_C=0.87] I would like to foreshadow that I will be moving a request for amendment when the bill is under consideration in Committee. I will speak to the request in Committee but can indicate that it is in relation to the error identified by the member for Huon during the briefing earlier today. I commend the bill to the House.

[2.38 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - [Bookmark: Phr12_O=207.6_D=0.9_C=0.94]  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=210.8_D=24.1_C=0.81]  Mr President, today we are asked to consider the 2025 supply bills - measures that, while interim by design, carry significant implications for the fiscal management and transparency of the government. We are informed these bills do not include new initiatives, capital projects or equity contributions. That is what we are told and, in strict appropriation terms, this may be technically correct [Bookmark: Phr14_O=235.8_D=2.8_C=0.72] . However, it is impossible to tell from the information available.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=239.9_D=19.4_C=0.77] In the energy and renewables area there is an amount greater than the 50 per cent of this supply bill, based on the methodology used - although it is very difficult to track, as output groups have been altered and moved in the 2025-26 Budget, making scrutiny of this bill extremely difficult. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=260.2_D=16.4_C=0.84]  This restructuring of a number of departments and splitting and alteration of output groups makes it impossible to fully understand these bills and to be assured that all necessary areas are adequately funded for the next six months, or however long it takes [Bookmark: Phr17_O=276.9_D=2.4_C=0.79]  a new state budget to be agreed.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=280.7_D=12.2_C=0.65] To suggest in any way this is merely procedural and that these bills should somehow be devoid of meaningful fiscal choices or reflective of mere continuity would be inaccurate as well [Bookmark: Phr19_O=295.1_D=7.3_C=0.81] . If there is any inaccuracy, even by omission, the lack of detail to support this bill makes it hard to fully understand. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=304.2_D=0.6_C=0.44]  This does no service to the trust the public place in us.

I know it is not customary to have a whole heap of information on a supply bill, but usually we are presented a supply bill in much more controlled circumstances and situations. We first saw the bill on Friday in an email. We had a briefing this morning that was dealt with in the other place this morning and all power to the member for Huon for picking up that typographical error. That is because it was done in a rush and all done manually, as we were informed by Treasury.

This lack of trust is one of the reasons we are even here debating these bills.

Treasury has advised an appropriation of $4.613 billion is required to sustain government operations from 1 July 2025 to 31 December 2025. Of this, $4.273 billion is for operating services and $309.7 million for capital works. Another $29.6 million is allocated in Supply Bill (No. 2) for parliamentary and statutory offices, to be debated after this bill.

At face value, this represents a straight-line extrapolation, six months of expenditure based on the previous year's appropriation acts, but a closer look informed by the budget papers from 2024-25 and the estimated outcomes, as described in the 2025-26 budget papers - a very welcome inclusion - and the 2025-26 budget papers that remain unprogressed, perhaps more complex and in some cases curious numbers.

Across the board, capital expenditure in the supply bill averages around 50 per cent for the full-year 2025-26 Budget estimates. That is what you would expect for a six-month stopgap measure. However, turning to operating expenditure, the picture becomes less clear. The supply bill appears to allocate around 51 per cent of the 2025-26 budget estimate and about 56 per cent of the 2024-25 estimated outcome.

Without access to actual expenditure figures for the first half of 2024-25, we cannot verify this is a prudent approximation or an over-allocation masked by continuity. I am not suggesting that is the case, but it makes it really hard unless you go and pull every annual report out of every department and go through every line item. Who had time over the weekend for that?

I do thank the Acting Leader for providing greater clarity in the second reading speech that was requested in the briefing to explain more fully how the figures are arrived at. I am not saying it is not done correctly; it just makes it really hard to follow the money.

If agency spending in the first half of the year ran hot, for example, as some evidence suggests, then this bill could be carrying a buffer far above what is needed. Now, that is a reality; that could occur, and it could also mean that some areas are underdone.

We know there is a provision in the Financial Management Act to move amounts across various areas to even things up, which we see at the end of a financial year, but we are being asked to take this on trust that the appropriate amounts are being appropriated.

We need to understand the numbers and how these figures were arrived at, especially in the context of an uncertain political calendar and possible looming election. A supply bill is not a blank cheque; it is a temporary targeted instrument designed to ensure the government does not grind to a halt in the absence of an enacted budget.

Does passing this bill mean certain new programs will be paused? They will be if they are only new programs in the 2025-26 Budget; that is absolutely the case.

What we do not see and what should concern us all is transparency around the Treasurer's Reserve. I did ask about this in a subsequent briefing I had. I know that the Acting Leader will be able to provide some more clarity on this. Everything is in one line item under Finance-General and a lot of money sits in Finance-General. We have no breakdown or detail on how those funds might be used.

With regard to the Treasurer's Reserve, I want to have confirmed there is $25 million that has been appropriated through this supply bill for the Treasurer's Reserve. I hope like hell, Mr President, we do not see what we saw in 2021 when the Treasurer's Reserve was used to fund election commitments if we go to an election. We saw that in 2021. The Integrity Commission was not enamoured with that and neither was the Public Accounts Committee.

It did not happen in 2023 but here we are again, just over a year later, thinking about another election that will cost us money - money we do not have and do not need to spend.

We face constitutional ambiguity during the caretaker period. Governments are constrained by longstanding conventions. Once a new government is elected and if the supply bills remain in force, how can that government operate without supply constraints?

One would assume the answer to that is yes, until a new budget is brought down. How long will that take? If there is a change of government, we have seen how long it can take.

These are legitimate, genuine concerns that there will be constraints because of the way a supply bill is structured. Yet still, without a fully authorised budget, we are in a legislative grey zone that underscores the need for vigilance, scrutiny and clarity. That is why I am making this contribution today; we should not just wave it through with no scrutiny. In fact, if there had not been scrutiny, the error would not have been picked up.

In addition, as a decision likely needs to be made regarding Marinus Link - possibly during the caretaker period - we should all be able to see the whole-of-state business case. If we go off to an election, if parliament is prorogued, that should be made available to the members of this House and the other House, so we all know what the situation is there. I would ask that the government would commit to that. It has significant implications for the state. The whole-of-state business case was to be made public relatively soon.

We were informed in the briefings there is no funding in this bill for the North West Transmission Developments or Marinus Link. What does that mean if the final investment decision suggests Marinus Link should commence, that the Tasmanian Government should proceed, particularly if it happens during caretaker mode, and the Tasmanian Government, on behalf of the people of Tasmania, was required to make a decision - a massive financial decision? I am sure the government is giving due consideration to all these matters, but it really bothers me.

It has been suggested we would need a supplementary appropriation bill to make the funding available that would be required under the agreement with the Commonwealth government and Victorian government. To do that we will need a functioning parliament.

I am sure that the other two stakeholder owners of Marinus Link are contemplating these very things as we speak - looking at us thinking, 'What the hell is going on down there?'

On top of all this, we must be honest about what lies ahead. When the 2025-26 Budget does finally arrive, I venture we will confirm what many already suspect: that the state's finances will have deteriorated, structural deficits will have deepened and expenditure pressures will have compounded. The longer we delay full transparency, the worse the reckoning is likely to be.

Should we support the passage of the supply bill here to ensure services continue and hardworking public servants are paid? Of course we should, but we must ensure full scrutiny and oversight of these bills that have been clearly prepared in haste.
This is highlighted by the typographical error in the Department of Premier and Cabinet line. Whilst the bottom number is correct, the number was incorrect. This is what happens when we rush, and I understand this has to be done manually.

On that point, the digital transformation piece will not be - well, maybe the Acting Leader can confirm whether or not there is ongoing funding into that important body of work? Surely, we can move into this century with some of these mechanisms - costing money.

The restructuring of a number of departments, and thus output allocations, has made our task of scrutiny even more challenging. When looking at appropriation in the 2025-26 budget papers that are now consigned to the rubbish bin of history, it is almost impossible to track what an appropriation of roughly 50 per cent should be. Nowhere is this more evident than in State Growth. Across the board, the operating expenditure in the supply bill appears to be about 61 per cent of the total annual budget for 2025-26. That is above a six-month share.

Likewise, in the allocations for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Consumer Affairs, notionally when you are looking at State Growth, the Housing portfolio - and I was informed, too, that the Planning office, which includes some Planning policy, sits in there, but not other areas of Planning or Consumer Affairs, they are listed in Justice. This requested operational funding is 88 per cent of the full-year budget, and 267 per cent of last year's expenditure. It is really hard to know exactly what is going on here - we are talking about operating, not capital. I have asked the Acting Leader to provide further clarity around these matters.

I am sure that this huge discrepancy here is not the case, but how would I know without further breakdown and detailed information? I refuse to take things on trust from this government. We have been let down too many times in recent years. I have been unable to make sense of the allocation in Housing, Planning and Consumer Affairs and ask the Leader to provide further explanation about how the $152.7 million of operating funding has been appropriated and on what basis - and a breakdown. We need to know exactly what we are funding and where the detail sits.

Another area I have a few questions about is Finance-General. As I said, Finance-General is a critical part of the state's financial framework. The proposed appropriation supply bill needs a lot more explanation. The Treasury portfolio and Finance-General contains large appropriations for which more detail is needed. I note the 2024-25 Budget appropriated $791,619,000 and the 2025-26 Budget appropriates $1.266 billion. The estimated outcome was $611 million. These numbers are all over the place. The supply bill is asking for $349 million, and that is only a fraction of the full-year budget amount that was deemed necessary in the 2025-26 Budget. Whilst it may be 57 per cent of the estimated outcome amount, events have moved so much that the estimated outcome seems an unrealistically low figure. We need more detail on this as we face an ever-increasing debt burden. This bill could be in place for at least six months. It could be.

Specifically, in the 2025-26 budget papers - yes, the ones that are in the bin and that painted a very bleak picture, both current and future - Output group 1.1, Debt Servicing, had gone through the roof, as we all know. How much of the additional required appropriation is included in the supply bill? I ask this because it is really clear that we have increasing debt repayments, increasing interest payments, and it is not clear that we are going to have enough to meet our obligations if we base it on the estimated outcome, when you see the huge uptick in the appropriation of the 2025-26 Budget. How was that figure arrived at? If it is simply half of the 2024-25 Budget, noting that this bill continues for six months, we will see challenges in the interest payments.

Furthermore, funds needed by the government businesses in 2025-26, according to the budget papers that we are not progressing, are very large amounts. These are included to enable a large proposed injection into TasNetworks for the North West Transmission Developments, and we have heard that is not included in the supply bill, and also potentially for the Marinus Link project. There is none in the supply bill for that either.

That being the case, if an election is called, can we be assured, as I asked a moment ago, that the whole-of-state business case is made available and no unilateral decisions regarding such a huge investment are made without full transparency - noting, as I said, the need for a supplementary appropriation bill to fund these projects can only progress with a functioning government and parliament?

What about the $127 million needed by the Tasmanian Risk Management Fund as described in the budget papers? It is the first time it has had an appropriation to top it up based on actuarial advice; but I assume that, because it was not there in 2024-25, there is no allocation for that and, as we are seeing increasing claims, particularly personal injury claims, that is the reason it has an appropriation in the budget papers. These are all questions I would have asked through budget Estimates. Here we are now; what does that mean? Does it mean we will not have adequate funds to cover liabilities as they emerge?

Then, there are all the grants and subsidies in Finance-General that mainly administer to expenses, such as local government grants and concessions for utility payments like the energy bill relief and those sorts of things. Are these included in the supply bill? If they are, which ones and how much? We do need a meaningful breakdown and time to consider them.

What happens in Finance-General encapsulates the fiscal issues facing the state and how the government tackles them. Hence, it is grossly remiss of the government to ask for any amount of funds even without limited justification or explanatory detail as we have seen with this supply bill.

We have a bill where all the line items are compressed, there is change in the departments, so that what did appear last year is now appearing differently because they have been compressed into other portfolio areas. There is no explanatory detail and even the clause notes gave us no clues.

I say it again. This looks rushed and there is little to no explanation. It does not give the parliament any ability to fully scrutinise it or exercise oversight. We cannot and should not be expected to authorise hundreds of millions of dollars without such clarity. I know it is a supply bill, and I understand the circumstance, but that is not an excuse for us to not do our job. I know we should and really must support this bill in the interest of good government and to ensure the wheels of government keep turning, but I expected a bit more information.

What is very clear is that the future is uncertain in this state. Who knows what will occur over the next six months? If we go to an election, we are even further in debt, if the two previous elections are anything to go by. What happens if we have another election and after six months the Budget is not passed, either because no-one offers a credible pathway out of our desperate financial situation or we have not been able to get a functioning parliament or government? Unthinkable, perhaps?

Ms O'Connor - Well, I think we are better than that.

Ms FORREST - I think we are - but I will keep going. It was unthinkable that that could occur a number of years ago, absolutely, but now we see all the things that are going on. I do not need to remind members of another stuff-up of monumental and costly proportions. Less than a year ago, who would have thought the government could forget to build, or be incapable of building, a critical new berth for a new Spirit of Tasmania vessel? Who would have thought? This really should be called the berth balls-up, not the ferry fiasco, by the way. The state was in charge of building the berth through a state-owned company. The ferries were built in Finland, even though that has not gone entirely smoothly, for some reasons well outside the control of the state such as the Ukraine war, but the last early election interrupted critical decision-making related to the ferries. That was the last caretaker period when we had the extra €50 million agreed to be paid to the Finnish shipbuilder. Arguably, that was the way it was done; it was scrutinised by PAC, but it left unanswered questions.

I could name many other truly unbelievable occurrences under this government. We should be able to work together as a parliament, across the parliament, and use our best people to address these challenges in the face of such a looming financial catastrophe. Sadly, black swan events are happening with increasing regularity in this state. 

I reiterate my comments and concern regarding the impending decision on Marinus Link, noting the timing must be of the essence. If an election is called, we need to see that whole-of-state business case and we need to be assured that no unilateral decisions regarding such a huge investment will be made without full transparency.

As I said, we saw that issue with the additional €50 million being paid under the last caretaker period, in a manner that was less than transparent.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=13.2_D=24.0_C=0.71] I will repeat some of the matters that I raised in an opinion piece yesterday in the Mercury. If an election is called, full transparency must follow immediately. Under section 5 of the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007, the Treasurer is required to publish a Pre-election Financial Outlook (PEFO), an independent report detailing the real state of the budget. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=38.0_D=7.9_C=0.67]  Despite the 2024 PEFO only providing an update on risks, in light of the financial stakes and ongoing misinformation [Bookmark: Phr4_O=46.5_D=3.7_C=0.81]  it is critical that this report is prepared as soon as possible [Bookmark: Phr5_O=51.6_D=6.2_C=0.85] , to inform voters of the truth - regardless of the recent budget, which did not pass parliament, and regardless of this bill.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=58.6_D=6.7_C=0.72] This is critical as the government is in possession of the Marinus Link whole-of-state business case [Bookmark: Phr7_O=66.6_D=8.5_C=0.55] . I ask that this be released, in full, in the interest of transparency and full disclosure to the members of parliament.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=76.0_D=17.0_C=0.77] Treasury is in a unique position to access all data to review the real cost of the stadium, the escalating needs of the health system, the pressure on TT-Line and Bass Strait services, the totality of unfunded infrastructure promises [Bookmark: Phr9_O=93.8_D=19.3_C=0.80] , and provide a credible assessment of the true state of the Tasmanian budget. Tasmanians deserve a full and independent picture before casting their votes. 

All parties seeking election must then respond to the PEFO with a clear, detailed strategy as to how they will manage the very real challenges facing the state. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=115.4_D=26.2_C=0.79]  This will require real leadership and courage and a long-term plan. This is critical. It is about responsible government, transparent leadership and the integrity of democratic institutions. Parliament must never become a rubber stamp for executive overreach, especially where public money is at stake. Tasmania is at a crossroads economically, politically and institutionally. If you do not believe that, just have a look at what happened last week. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=142.3_D=5.6_C=0.82]  This is not a time for blind optimism. It is a time for honesty, transparency and responsible leadership.
 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=148.9_D=5.4_C=0.77] 
There are a number of large 'elephants in the room' ready to start a stampede [Bookmark: Phr13_O=155.3_D=26.1_C=0.81]  - critical and large investments on behalf of the state. In my view, these are all immediate and real problems and going into an election makes it even more difficult to herd them. These are critical decisions that should be considered by the parliament, not a few members in caretaker mode.

Let us name a couple: TT-Line. TT-Line is in a financial world of pain [Bookmark: Phr14_O=182.7_D=12.6_C=0.78]  - likely to need additional funding, and it is unlikely TASCORP will enable them to borrow even more to deliver critical infrastructure. We simply cannot have a state-owned company on the brink of financial disaster.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=196.8_D=5.3_C=0.68] Here we are, at the end of the financial year, going into the next financial year [Bookmark: Phr16_O=203.5_D=8.9_C=0.75] . Marinus Link and the North West Transmission Developments - huge and important decisions that should be determined openly and transparently, not behind the closed doors of a caretaker convention. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=214.2_D=9.2_C=0.71]  It is a matter for government as to who is briefed, should a decision need to be made. This should include all members of parliament, not just the opposition minister, the shadow minister and leader.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=231.8_D=23.6_C=0.79] Then there is the Macquarie Point stadium. The Tasmanian Planning Commission process will continue, as it is only parliament that can resolve to remove it, unless the Tasmanian Planning Commission itself believes there is no reasonable chance of success. Is there adequate funding to ensure MPDC and the government can provide all the necessary information to the Tasmanian Planning Commission to enable it to do its job?

 [Bookmark: Phr21_O=256.6_D=28.1_C=0.81] I could go on, but suffice to say the situation we find ourselves in is an absolute mess - a mess of the government's own making. They should blame no-one else. Rather, take responsibility, accept the will of the House and fix the mess they have created. 

In this moment of political instability, truth and transparency are now more important than ever. If we are to repair our finances and restore public trust, it starts with full disclosure and it starts now.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=285.4_D=14.6_C=0.74] I have asked myself, should we vote against these bills leaving downstairs no alternative but to set aside their games of brinksmanship that are distracting and driving the people of Tasmania crazy, and simply get on with discussing and passing the proposed or amended budget on the table? [Bookmark: Phr23_O=300.8_D=4.0_C=0.52]  It seems now, Mr President, this is entirely in Her Excellency the Governor's hands. I will, subject to the Acting Leader's response, support this bill. However, my concern stands that we continue to kick a heavy and unwieldy can down the road and not take real and urgent action to correct our fiscal trajectory.

I said we are in a mess of the government's own making, many years in the making. All members of parliament need to be aware of this and respond. We simply cannot keep going on the same way expecting a different outcome.

[3.05 p.m.]
Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre) - Mr President, I have a brief offering - a lot of it has already been said by the honourable member for Murchison. It is pretty clear that what we are dealing with today is a mess. I also asked a couple of questions through the briefing and thank the honourable Acting Leader for that opportunity. I will take the opportunity to put them on the public record.

One other question that I have is that it is important for the people of Tasmania to understand what the cost of a new election might look like for them.

Ms Forrest - More than last time.

Ms RATTRAY - More than last time. That is one of the issues that we have been talking about out in the community: that there are some new arrangements in the parliament since the Electoral Amendment Bill that was passed - in November 2024, from memory?

Ms O'Connor - It was 2023.

Ms RATTRAY - Gosh, time goes quickly, doesn't it? We need to have some understanding so that the people of Tasmania have a really clear indication of what the cost is going to be. That is going to impact the next part of any new budget coming forward, no matter who is part of the government or what the arrangement might look like, whether it be a power-sharing arrangement or whether it be a majority government. If that is available, I am sure somebody has crunched a few numbers between last Thursday and this Tuesday - to have that for the state of Tasmania, and particularly the people that I represent. They will want to know how much this is costing, additional to what has been proposed and projected.

As a member of the Public Works Committee, certainly there will be works that will not proceed if there is an election called. I am interested to have some understanding of what impact that might have, particularly on the Kings Meadows Community Health Centre. It is partly through the Public Works assessment process. I am interested in whether that completely falls over for now. There is a DA, I understand - that is public knowledge - with the Launceston City Council. Where does that go? Is it just kicked down the road for a time? I know that you can just pick up a reference, but of course you have to have a government in place, you have to have members of parliament who sit on that committee, then you have to find time to go back to those matters. That is just one really important piece of infrastructure. 

The Public Works Committee was meeting on Monday of next week to assess the hospice in Launceston - another project that has been long-awaited. Again, if there is an election called between now and Monday, then assessment of that project will not proceed either. There are a number of others. A road project - Midway Point dual lanes - we know it is a bit of a bottleneck out there. Again, that is a Public Works project that has had its site visit and hearings, but is still waiting to proceed through the process.

Three really important projects: it is important we have some understanding of where they are, particularly about the Kings Meadows Community Health Centre, when a DA has already been put into the Launceston City Council.

On page 6 of Schedule 1, about the capital services for the Department for Education, Children and Young people, under the Minister for Children and Youth, there are some capital services of $12.391 million. I asked in the briefing what that related to and it is to progress the youth justice facility and some IT. I am assuming that that project will proceed, albeit there will be the DA process where there will be opportunity for representation from any of the community and there will be a Public Works assessment process through that now. I am just interested if that is the entire capital services budget, is that one youth justice facility proposed for the south of the state and what the component is for the IT. I think that is probably all.

In the briefing, it was interesting, a question was asked by the member for Hobart on the Minister for Racing, which is page 8, and the $40.117 million in operating services. We understood from the answer received that the arrangements for providing the deed funding is to do with a time factor there - that has the $37 million deed requirement in that as well - just to have that confirmed would be useful.

My final observation, I have no intention of not supporting this supply bill, because there are an enormous number of people who rely on the state of Tasmania for their salaries, for programs, for supporting other Tasmanians. I will be supporting it but, again, I support some of the aspects that were indicated by the member for Murchison and support that yes, it feels like a mess, it looks like a mess and it is a mess.

I congratulate the member for Huon for picking up the mistake that we are going to deal with as a request for amendment to the bill and it will have to go back to the other place. We will continue to do our work in regard to scrutiny and there is not much else to say when it comes to where we are, right now, today.

[3.14 p.m.]
Ms PALMER (Rosevears - Acting Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I will seek some advice.

Mr President, I thank members for their contributions. I have some answers to questions that came out of those contributions. I will start with the member for Murchison who had some questions about Marinus. Project Marinus, as we know, is a vital part of our energy future and one that the government is pleased to have bipartisan support from Labor with the industry through Clean Energy Tasmania. It is vital for the future of our economy as it grows and as we continue to electrify. The project is at a critical juncture which, without passing the 2025-26 Budget, does raise complexities for any equity calls beyond July. The Budget was to make provision for equity contributions for Marinus Link and the North West Transmission Developments so that we were ready for a potential positive Final Investment Decision (FID). No equity calls on Tasmania are expected before the end of July. Discussions are ongoing, including with the Commonwealth as the largest shareholder in Marinus Link, about funding for the project, should a positive FID be taken.

Some advice: there is also an option for an incoming government to consider any appropriation bill. I am also advised that Treasury officials are in conversation with the Commonwealth.
The supply bill does not include equity for new items included in the 2025-26 budget paper. Any future equity contribution will need to be addressed in appropriation bills expected to be brought back to the parliament late in the calendar year 2025. If there is a pressing need for an equity contribution, this would be dealt with under the caretaker convention.

Questions you had on the Treasurer's Reserve. The supply amount for the Treasurer's Reserve is $25 million. This reflects 50 per cent of the budgeted amount. This supply provision reflects prudent capacity to manage the likelihood of uncertain and unforeseen costs.

You then asked about the digital transformation. The digital transformation initiative in Legislature-General is funded through the Finance-General $25 million Digital Transformation Priority Expenditure Program. This is not new purpose expenditure from the perspective of Finance-General and is, therefore, funded in the supply bill.

Questions about Finance-General grants and subsidies. The supply amounts for grants and subsidies through Finance-General follow the general methodology for operating services supply. Therefore, the supply bill covers items including the First Home Owner Grant in the Finance portfolio; Home Warranty Insurance scheme, Treasurer; energy retailer concession, Treasurer; TT-Line pensioner concession subsidy, Treasurer; and other grants and payments as reflected by items which had 2025-26 estimates in the 2024-25 Budget.

The provision does not provide for new policy decisions, in particular, equity payments which are significant in the tabled 2025-26 budget papers, including the Tasmanian Risk Management Fund (TRMF). With regard to the TRMF, there is no coverage of this item in the supply bill as this is a new item in the 2025-26 budget papers. This item can be addressed at any time, including in a future 2025 appropriation bill, and in the past has been included in supplementary appropriation bills. The appropriation for the Tasmanian Risk Management Fund included in the 2025-26 budget papers reflected the latest analysis and advice regarding increasing liabilities and changes to potential claims estimates. There is sufficient funding to cover this year's liabilities. Additional funding is required to ensure long-term sustainability of the fund.

I think there was a question about debt servicing as well. The amount included under debt servicing in the supply bill is $124 million. This reflects the timing of when interest is due to be paid. The amount for Energy and Renewables equates to approximately 50 per cent of the 2025-26 Budget of $25 million and amounts to $12.5 million.

There was a question about Housing, Planning and Consumer Affairs. The portfolio has appropriation through the Department of Justice and the Department of State Growth. This reflects the administrative orders on which the 2025-26 Budget was developed. For this portfolio, the Department of Justice is funded $5.6 million for WorkSafe Tasmania, $2.73 million for the Tasmanian Planning Commission, and $5.99 million for Consumer, Building and Occupational Services. The Department of State Growth is funded $131.48 million for Homes Tasmania, $1.11 million for the State Planning Office and $20.14 million for Housing and Planning. The administered payment to Homes Tasmania is made early in the financial year and thus the supply bill reflects the standard payment timing of that grant. Descriptions of the purposes of supply for these outputs can be found in the 2024-25 budget papers.

I now have some answers to questions from the member for McIntyre, who asked about the cost of an election. An approximate cost for a new election is $5.75 million, and that is the current best estimate.

Ms Rattray - That includes the payment for votes?

Ms PALMER - I would have to seek some advice on that.

Ms Webb - It does not include pork-barrelling either.

Ms PALMER - The member for McIntyre also asked with regard to the Racing portfolio. The minister for the Racing portfolio has said:

Appropriation through the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRET) for racing regulation and policy, as well as administered Tasmanian racing assistance. The Tasracing Operating Grant must be paid in early July; hence it is reflected in full in the supply bill.

Ms O'Connor - Just to confirm, that is as a result of the arrangements in the racing deed?

Ms PALMER - That is my understanding, yes.

Ms O'Connor - It should be scrapped for budget repair.

Ms PALMER - You also had some questions about funding for the Kings Meadows Community Health Centre funding, of which $10 million is from the Australian Government - it will continue, as this was included in the 2024-25 Budget.

You then had some questions about the capital in education. Capital projects covered by the supply bill for the Department for Education, Children and Young People include existing projects under the portfolio of Children and Youth and for Education. For Children and Youth, supply provides funds for youth justice facilities and enhanced case management for children and young people in detention and out-of-home care. 

Thank you very much to the officials. I am just going to seek some advice to finalise that question.

Ms Rattray - I did ask about the Public Works process as well.

Ms PALMER - Would you please repeat your question about Public Works?

Ms Rattray - My question was about the process of what happens when money is allocated, but they cannot proceed because there is still an approval process through the Public Works Committee on foot and not completed.

Ms PALMER - Okay. I will seek some advice on that. While I am waiting, I can tell you the approximate cost of a new election is $5.75 million. That is our current best estimate and I am advised that is for the TEC to cover their administrative costs to run the election.

The advice that I have been given, member for McIntyre, is that it would depend on where the project is at in the process. If the approval of the committee was required, the project would have to wait until parliament resumes.

Ms RATTRAY - Madam Chair, I have a question in regard to clarification of the cost of elections. My understanding is that the $5.8 million for the TEC is for operating costs. Also, my understanding is that from 1 July there will be public funding under the Electoral Amendment Bill that was passed previously so there is funding for parties and there is funding per vote. What is that cost going to be because that will be on top of [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.2_D=4.5_C=0.89]  the $5.8 million? It is only fair [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.3_D=9.0_C=0.84]  the people of Tasmania know how much an election is going to cost. Can I have an update, thank you?

Ms PALMER -  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=44.9_D=1.9_C=0.50] I will take some advice. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=56.2_D=8.4_C=0.49] 

Ms O'Connor - It is operating in the slightly hypothetical at the moment though, isn't it?

Ms Webb - It starts on 1 July.

Ms O'Connor - We have not had an election called.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=66.9_D=1.9_C=0.43] Ms Rattray - So what are we doing?

Ms O'Connor - It might be [Bookmark: Phr8_O=78.5_D=6.5_C=0.64]  half the election comes under the act and the other half of it does not because it did not come into effect on 1 July.

Ms PALMER - I am advised, and this is an estimate based on the last election, that it is just over $2 million in campaign funding.

Ms RATTRAY - That was my understanding as well. Now it is on the public record, so it is $5.8 million plus $2 million and obviously we have no way of knowing how much the per-vote cost will be because it is $6 per vote that comes into play.

My question is, does the $2 million that has been proposed need to be paid in this supply bill - because it is campaign funding - so does that need to be paid now or whenever this supply bill is enacted? I am interested to know whether that $2 million for campaign funding comes out of this allocation in the supply bill.

Ms PALMER - I am advised that it does not need to be in this bill because it is funded by reserve by law.

Ms O'CONNOR - Madam Chair, there are two line items that relate to the environment in the supply bill. One is in NRET and one is in the Department of State Growth. Both of them are just a fraction of the amount of money that is given towards Racing, for example. Can the minister tell the Council where the climate funding is? Is it in State Growth under the Renewables portfolio, or is it within NRET under the Environment allocation? Given that there is no line item for climate in the supply bill, which is noteworthy in itself, can you tell us where the Climate Office and the Climate Action Plan, for example, are funded in this supply bill, not in terms of the administrative arrangements?

Ms PALMER - I can advise the member for Hobart the climate funding sits in the Department of State Growth, Minister for Environment: Operating Services, on page 10.

Ms PALMER - I move a request in my name. Schedule 1, page 9 -

That the House of Assembly be requested to amend item 10 in respect of the Operating Services for the Premier, by deleting '28 862' and substituting '26 863'.

In speaking to that request, this request for amendment to the other place is to correct an error in a number. As provided within the request for amendment, item 10, in respect of the operating services for the Premier, should read $26,862,000 rather than $28,862,000. I think all members can appreciate that these are unprecedented circumstances, with many hardworking officials working very quickly to ensure the delivery of these supply bills, including the one currently before the Council.

Importantly, the totals do add up. However, it is, of course, of most importance that we ensure that the bill is correct. I want to thank members and particularly the member for Huon for raising this issue and for the members' patience as we work to rectify this as soon as possible.

Ms O'CONNOR - Madam Chair, I would just like to unpack this line item a bit and I know, Chair, in your really enlightening contribution, you did question the money that is front-ended into Housing. Given the report on Homes Tasmania, which found very significant issues with the way it is established and running - and that is no discredit to any of the good people who are working there - can we have some real clarity on that $152.735 million?

I know you answered before when you answered the member for Murchison's question about it, but is that TASCORP loans? Is that funding that is required to operate the social housing portfolio?

Again, because of the lack of detail, I do not know what this really means. It is a vast sum of money. Wouldn't it be great if it is all being spent on housing?

Ms PALMER - In answer to your question, I have some figures to break down that larger amount. For Housing and Planning, it is $20.1 million; State Planning Office, $1.1 million; and Homes Tasmania, $131.4 million.
What comes into that Homes Tasmania budget is the operating funding for grants, borrowing costs, bills and maintenance.

Ms O'CONNOR - Thank you, so a decision was made not to list any of that under Capital Services because it is part of some of the construction works and the bills are being captured as an operating expense for Homes Tasmania?

Ms PALMER - I am advised it is because it is grants.

Postponed clause 4 -
Issue, application and appropriation of $4 583 430 000

Ms RATTRAY - Madam Chair, my understanding is the reserved-by-law public funding for campaign funding for the House of Assembly is included in the sum out of the Public Account. Can it be confirmed that $2 million is there and if it has to be paid in this supply budget? Is it there? Or where does it come from if it is not included in that $4.58 billion?

Ms PALMER - I am just seeking some advice, Madam Chair.

Thank you. Again, I can confirm it is not in the supply bill. Because it is reserved by law it is not a decision of the parliament. It is not in the supply bill; it is in another statute.,

Ms RATTRAY - I acknowledge we are in unprecedented times, but I am trying to get my head around how we can have public campaign funding for House of Assembly elections. Even though we perhaps are not at an election at this point in time, it sort of feels like it. Otherwise, we possibly would not be doing this today.

I do not understand, if it is not reserved by law, but it is not there and it has to be paid within the next six months, how you can have campaign funding to House of Assembly parties and members if there is an election in the next six months. I do not understand that. Forgive me if it is very plain to others but, as I said, these are unprecedented times and I do not understand.

Ms PALMER - Madam Chair, what this is, is an automatic appropriation. If I can give you an example of something else that comes under this so you are able to compare it, it is like judges' salaries. That is another piece of legislation that the parliament has agreed to that says this will be an automatic payment, therefore it is not in the supply bill because it is not a decision of the parliament. That decision is being made in other legislation, so it is an automatic appropriation just the same as for our judges' salaries.

Second Reading

[4.02 p.m.]
Ms PALMER (Rosevears - Acting Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, I move -

That the bill be now read a second time.

In accordance with the current appropriation convention, two supply bills have been prepared, one to provide funding for the services of the government and the other to provide funding for the services of the government in respect of parliamentary and statutory offices.

I recently outlined the need for the supply bills to be introduced to parliament this financial year in my second reading speech on Supply Bill (No. 1) 2025. The information provided in that speech applies equally to this bill. Supply Bill (No. 2) 2025 seeks parliament's approval to provide for the appropriation of $29.6 million out of the Public Account for expenditure on operating services in 2025-26 until the budget appropriation bills are enacted. I commend the bill to the House.

Bill read the second time.
