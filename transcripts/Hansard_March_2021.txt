Tuesday 11 November 2025

The Speaker, Mrs Petrusma, took the Chair at 12.00 p.m., acknowledged the Traditional People, and read Prayers.


STATEMENT BY PREMIER

Absence of Legislative Council Ministers and Mrs Archer

Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I advise the House that as the Legislative Council is also sitting at 12.00 p.m., the Legislative Council ministers are therefore not able to be in attendance today. In their absence, I will take questions from their portfolios. 

I also advise that minister Archer will be absent from the Chamber due to illness. In Mrs Archer's absence, I will also take questions on her portfolios.


QUESTIONS

TT-Line - Insolvency

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

You said you've intervened, but this has gone from disaster to catastrophe on your watch. The Auditor-General determined that TT-Line was insolvent in August. When were you first made aware that the Auditor-General had determined TT-Line was insolvent? What steps did you take once you were informed? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. If my memory serves me correctly - we can get a timeline for you - the shareholders were the first informed on 21 July, I'm advised.

I want to state that the Tasmanian Auditor-General is entitled to his opinion and commentary. The fact is that TT-Line is solvent, and the government will ensure their continued trading and operation. TT-Line directors have confirmed that the company remains solvent. This determination has been made on independent advice from external experts. The company continues to pay its debts as and when they fall due. The company has approximately $400 million in undrawn government guaranteed debt, I am advised. The 2025-26 Budget contains an additional $74.5 million in an equity contribution.

The directors and management, with the assistance from specialist advisers continue to work on developing a range of long-term financially sustainable options for the government to consider. We commend the ongoing transformation of the business under the leadership of TT-Line Chair Ken Kanofski and CEO Chris Carbone. 

Yes, we did intervene. We recognise the long and arduous journey when it comes to the delivery of the ships and the associated wharf infrastructure. We intervened. There is new leadership in the Chair, the board and the CEO. I have enormous confidence in their ability.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Did the Premier seek further information from the Auditor-General around his determination, or has he just accepted TT-Line's version of events just like the member for Bass, Michael Ferguson, did?

The SPEAKER - The Premier can answer - you have gone a bit further down that path of inquiry.

Mr ROCKLIFF - TT-Line sought independent advice, as I stated in my answer, and TASCORP and TT-Line have been working on these matters.

Mr Willie - Point of order -

The SPEAKER - If your point of order is that the Premier is returning to his seat, I cannot put words in the Premier's mouth. You can ask another question now, Mr Willie

Mr Willie - It was whether he had sought information. He didn't go anywhere near it. 

The SPEAKER - Is that your next question?

Mr Willie - No, that's a point of order. 


TT-Line - Insolvency

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF.

[12.05 p.m.]
You have said you have intervened, but things keep getting worse. The Auditor-General determined that TT-Line was insolvent in August. As a state-owned company, TT-Line is subject to the Corporations (Tasmania) Act 1990, and its directors have a duty to prevent the company from trading and incurring debts if it is insolvent. Are you confident that TT-Line and its directors have not broken the law by trading while insolvent?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. Under the Corporations Act, it is the directors who determine if a company is solvent and they have an ongoing obligation to prevent a company from trading while insolvent. TT-Line's directors have confirmed that the company remains solvent and continues to pay its debts as and when they fall due. Before allowing a company to incur a debt, directors must consider if there are reasonable grounds to suspect it is insolvent or would become insolvent by incurring the debt. Directors face civil penalties for trading while insolvent and can be personally liable for the debts incurred while the company was insolvent - your question, et cetera. I have every confidence when it comes to the board and their actions.

Supplementary question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Has the Premier sought any information from the Auditor-General, who has made a determination that the company is insolvent, or is he just taking TT-Line's word for it? 

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I understand that Treasury has met with the Auditor-General. Can I make the point that TT-Line is a government business, and a government is not going to let a government business fall under the circumstances of trading while insolvent. That's why we support TT-Line and the investment and the board of directors. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, that's enough chatter in the room.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Impact on Budget

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[12.07 p.m.]
There's a stadium-sized hole in the budget that you're desperately trying to fill with cuts to essential services. Across the budget period, there will be a $27 million reduction in annual funding for services for children and families and youth justice. The commission of inquiry's initiatives for foster carers, intensive family engagement and support for young people leaving care have all been cut. There's no money to support strengthening the Integrity Commission's ability to investigate child sexual abuse, which was a critical recommendation from the Weiss review. There are cuts to family violence intervention, to legal aid and to outpatient hospital services. The 26Ten literacy and numeracy program will be written off. 

Just the government's payment of interest on the stadium's debt would cost at least $50 million a year. That's enough to fund all the programs I've mentioned and much more. Will you finally admit that building the stadium will result in more cuts to essential services?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for her question and the fact you will draw every bow possible when it comes to the stadium and your disagreement with it. I, however, believe it's a very sound investment for the future of Tasmania, not only in terms of generating jobs and growing our economy - of which, can I say, according to the Business Council of Australia, we're second when it comes to places to invest around the nation, and I believe we topped the NAB Business Confidence Survey released less than an hour ago. We want to keep that momentum so we can continue investing in the essential services that I care about and you care about. On those services, we do align. 

I will check my facts, but I believe that Legal Aid is supported, more than ever before, when it comes to their investment. Our government committed $424.5 million in the 2024-25 Budget and forward Estimates for the ongoing implementation of the commission of inquiry recommendations, including $92 million in 2025-26. This builds on funding of $55 million provided in 2023-24 prior to the acceptance of the commission of inquiry report. For 2025-26, $46 million was allocated through the initial supply bill, with further committed funding to be provided in the interim budget.

In addition, this Budget allocates $155 million to deliver the new Tasmanian Youth Justice Facility now that the site master plan and development applications are completed. This is in addition to the $50 million already allocated for the delivery of the new Youth Justice Facility in previous budgets, an additional $30.8 million to deliver a new human resource information system across government to link up employee information, which is a critical enabler to deliver the recommendations of the commission of inquiry and the Woolcott Review; an additional $2.9 million for the State Archives to digitise and make accessible files to victim-survivors, and $8.3 million over the forward Estimates for enhanced management of children and young people and the youth justice system and out-of-home care. 

This is long-term reform, and it was expected that funding profiles would change - and this reflects our commitment to genuine meaningful reform. However, with our additional investments this year, the whole-of-government budget to deliver the commission of inquiry has increased from $425 million over the forwards to over $600 million. In addition, we have set aside a further $600 million to compensate victim-survivors of child sexual abuse in our institutions.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - Thank you, Premier, for listing those things. Despite the amounts that you listed, the fact remains that cuts to the delivery of all the services in the question will occur and you will need to find an extra $50 million a year to pay the interest. The question still is: do you agree that that will mean more services will have to be cut to find that $50 million a year?

The SPEAKER - In regard to your original question, Dr Woodruff, the end of your question was cut off because you had exceeded your one minute. I draw the Premier back to the original question, but the end of your previous question was actually after the minute you had to ask.

Dr WOODRUFF - Thank you. I think I finished with 'it will result in more cuts,' and I missed out 'in essential services.'

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You've asserted such matters and I reject the premise of your question. We will be investing in areas of need across all portfolio areas. For example, we have significant new and additional funding to protect community safety, support the justice correction system, and invest in rehabilitation programs, and $4 million towards the ongoing increased demand for services provided by Tasmania Legal Aid, and I thank them for their services.


Budget Consultation

Mr O'BYRNE question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[12.13 a.m.]
Last week you handed down your self-titled 'interim budget', a budget that has deferred many of the big decisions and commitments made at the last election until next year's budget. Each year, Treasury walks through a consultation process with key stakeholders and communities, but next year's budget will be different. We all recognise the task before us and the importance of our decisions being attuned to the needs of all Tasmanians. Given that, the business-as-usual consultation process will not cut it, can you commit today that you and your government will do more than just phone it in? Will you do targeted, deeper consultations with unions, community organisations, and those in our community who have the most to lose from a budget that will seek to save rather than consolidate?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Franklin. We are a consultative government, always have been, and will continue to be. In delivering the budget in 2026 on 21 May, we will be consulting with the community. Letters have already gone out to numerous community groups - I understand around about 300 of those have already gone out. What I would say, and I would make a call from this parliament, that any organisation that would want to have input should make contact either through the portal, or through the letter of invitation that's been sent out to Treasury. Indeed, my office is always willing to listen, to learn and do whatever we can to serve the community to the very best of our ability. 

However, as a government, we are very mindful of the fact that we were sent to an early election in relation to the issue of what was claimed at the time or the terminology used at the time of 'budget repair'. We have listened to that and there will need to be some improvements made in relation to the forward Estimates. That said, we are always willing to listen, to learn, take into account the views of the community and many of those community organisations that serve our whole community so very well. 

We are all ears in relation to that. We are more than willing to listen and take on board. Some decisions will need to be made, so I can't promise that everything will be delivered, but what I can promise is that due diligence will be undertaken, that we will listen, that we will consider every single point of view that is provided to us. 

Supplementary Question

Mr O'BYRNE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Mr O'BYRNE - Thank you for your answer, Treasurer. Based on your answer, it seems very much that the responsibility is on people to raise it with you. The point of my question was putting the shoe on the other foot: that the Treasury and departments actually overtly contact and talk to groups that may be the subject of a decision that may not go their way. 

The SPEAKER - Honourable Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - When I said that this is a government which is consultative, I am speaking - I am sure - for and on behalf of each and every one of the ministers who sit behind me at the moment. What I'm saying is that I have no doubt they will reach out to the various stakeholders in their portfolio responsibilities to consider their concerns, their aspirations, and how they might be able to assist as well in the issue of a budget improvement. 

Over 300 letters have gone out already, but I'm more than willing to communicate. If Mr O'Byrne has a list of favourites, I'm more than happy to deal with those as well.


Budget - Revenue Raising Measures

Ms JOHNSTON question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[12.17 p.m.]
You've turned your back again on the experts, this time by ruling out raising revenue to repair the budget. Economists, like Saul Eslake, say we need payroll tax reform, duties on luxury vehicles, property-based levies, and salmon and mining royalties. Your own Treasury boss says, 'Concerted action is required involving both revenue and expenditure measures', but you're ignoring revenue options. You're relying too heavily on spending cuts, affecting Tasmanians who need hospitals, schools and community services. At the same time, though, you continue generous government assistance to industry grants, subsidies and equity injections. Is your message to Tasmanians that your private sector mates are more important than those in genuine need? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. One of the most important revenue bases for the state government is, in fact, from federal sources. Two-thirds of our funding comes from Canberra. The honourable member referred to health. Can I say that, on 2 September, there were 80 people in our public hospitals ready for aged care but unable to find an aged care bed. Whose responsibility is that? The federal government. Similarly, there were 21 people in hospital beds ready for discharge but unable to find a home because the National Disability Insurance Scheme was not looking after them as it should. That is 101 bed-blockers in our public hospital system. That amounts to three wards with bed-blockers. 

Can I invite the honourable member, and indeed everybody else in this Chamber, that when they seek increased revenue, instead of trying to get more money out of the pockets of their fellow Tasmanians - because that's what you're asking for - why don't you knock on the door of Canberra and invite Canberra to live up to its responsibilities, such as in health? Indeed, if they don't live up to their responsibility in health, we will be shortchanged over $600 million over the forward Estimates.

What I say to Ms Johnston - and I accept her concern for those in need of healthcare - is that we, as a state government, are backfilling those 101 beds and the cost of that, when those people should be discharged from hospital but they can't be because of the neglect of the federal Labor government.

I encourage all Tasmanians who are genuinely concerned about the budget situation that we're facing, especially in the area of health, to knock on the door of Canberra to make them live up to their responsibilities, rather than seek to take even more money out of the pockets of their fellow Tasmanians.

Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms JOHNSTON - In his answer, the Treasurer indicated that we should be increasing our revenue through Commonwealth assistance grants. Is the Treasurer suggesting, therefore, that we should not be growing our own source revenue, that we should forever only be trying to grow revenue for the Commonwealth assistance program?

Mr ABETZ - Absolutely not. That is why I want to see the economy growing and that's why I'm so supportive of the stadium, which the member for Clark opposes. I say to the honourable member for Clark that yes, we have a task of growing our economy. When you grow the economy it also grows the opportunity for government revenue, which then enables us to invest further in health, education, police, and infrastructure.

Yes, I can see where the honourable member is coming from, but I say to her, with respect, look at the situation. The biggest source of revenue we are being denied is not from our fellow Tasmanians, but from Canberra.

The SPEAKER - Honourable members, as today is Remembrance Day, I acknowledge Garry Ivory and his brother, Kevin, in the Speaker's Reserve. They are the nephews of Teddy Sheean VC. Thank you for coming here today.

Members - Hear, hear.

Macquarie Point Stadium - Impact on Budget

Mr BAYLEY question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[12.22 p.m.]
The stadium austerity budget lays out cuts to so many critically important government programs. If that's not bad enough, you've said that the real crunch will come next year. Your government has gone full Trump playbook, setting up a team to look for your next set of cuts. The embarrassingly titled Efficiency and Productivity Unit (EPU) has been tasked with finding hundreds of millions of dollars of savings from a public service that is already struggling to meet community needs.

Given the size of the savings the EPU is supposed to find, we're already hearing concerns that your goal is for cuts to the public service to increase next year: 2800 job cuts is already a confronting figure. Will you rule out increasing the target in next year's budget or could the number keep growing?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, it's interesting how everybody seeks to put their own label on this particular budget. In relation to the stadium, I invite honourable members to have a look at the budget papers and see what the expenditure levels are. I have in front of me the necessary information.

In the budget that was delivered on Thursday there is $18.6 million allocated to the stadium. The following year: $26.6 million. Is that going to fund public service pay rises over the next two years? Of course it won't. That is where there has been exaggeration by those opposed to the stadium, basically asserting that if you don't build the stadium you will have $1 billion each and every year for the forward Estimates, not accepting the fact that one is an operational cost, the other is a capital cost -

Mr Bayley - 50 million.

The SPEAKER - Order, the Deputy Leader of the Greens has asked a question.

Mr ABETZ - which is a one-off and will last for 30 to 50 years. Whereas, if you were to poke that $1 billion into wage increases this coming year, that would then be baked into the budget for each and every year thereafter. For this year, you might be able to get rid of a stadium - well, what are you going to do the following year and the year after that?

Dr Woodruff - What are you doing to the public service, that was the question.

The SPEAKER - Order, Dr Woodruff. You can ask your own question later on.

Mr ABETZ - There will not be the funding. What's more, and this is the disappointing thing, I am absolutely convinced that the Deputy Leader of the Greens understands that to be the case but is not willing to admit it because it will undermine the narratives that he is employing against the stadium.

Mr BAYLEY - Honourable Speaker, point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question was all about cuts to the public service. Would he rule out increasing the target in next year's budget, increasing it from 2800 jobs or could the number keep growing. There's a minute left.

The SPEAKER - I draw the Treasurer to the original question.

Mr ABETZ - I am more than happy to answer that, but the member is now embarrassed by the introduction to his question because that's what I was addressing, which undermined the then question that was tacked on to the very end of his question.

Does anybody want to downsize the public service? Of course not, but when you know that 46 per cent, rounded up to 50 per cent, of the budget is employed or used for public service wages, and those opposite and the Greens sent us to an early election saying there was a need for budget repair -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The Treasurer's time has expired.

Mr Abetz - Oh, what a pity.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Mr BAYLEY - The Treasurer still hasn't answered the question about job cuts, so could he come to that? He also talked about capital costs and operational costs in the budget. Now, the Premier has provided us the cost of servicing the Macquarie Point Development Corporation's debt, and that is around $30 million in 2030-31 and it sits at about that level, but he has not provided, as was promised to the budget panel, the cost of funding the state borrowings of $375 million. Will he do that ahead of Thursday's debate on the stadium order, because we know that that bakes in -

The SPEAKER - Mr Bayley, you are going into a new inquiry. You have a few seconds remaining. Can you refer to your original question and the Treasurer's answer without diverting from that, please?

Mr BAYLEY - Treasurer, would you confirm that you will not increase the target for public service cuts above 2800 in next year's budget?

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - This is one of those questions people ask when they're living permanent opposition. It's one of those questions of 'gotcha'. What I say to you is that we will seek to right-size the public service to ensure that that which is required by our fellow Tasmanians and that which we can afford will be delivered. If you want us to continue to increase the debt, the very issue that you sent us to an election on, there has to be some consistency and integrity in relation to that.

Dr Woodruff - How much more?

The SPEAKER - Order, Dr Woodruff. You still have more questions remaining. You can make a contribution then.

Mr ABETZ - That said, at this stage, there is no indication that that will be necessary.


TT-Line - Insolvency

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[12.28 p.m.]
You said you've intervened, but you forgot to build a wharf, built the ships wrong and sent the company broke. The Auditor-General determined that TT-Line was insolvent in August. Can you please explain why you think that they're solvent now?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question, laced, as it was with negativity. We have owned up -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. I ask the Premier not to incite interjections, please.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Alright. Laced with negativity, as that particular question was. Have you been through the ship? Have you been through the new ship? It is fantastic.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The only one speaking at the moment is the Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We've been through the new ship, it is fantastic, and the wharf is back on track after our intervention, which is fantastic to see. There are local companies such as VOS Constructions, BridgePro, employees on the site doing their job, and it will be magnificent infrastructure as the two new ships will be servicing Tasmania. In a year's time, the two ships will be transporting people to and from Tasmania, increasing and strengthening our visitor economy. 

Mr WILLIE - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. I asked him to explain how he thinks the company is solvent now; he's going nowhere near the question.

The SPEAKER - That was in the original question, Premier. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I was highlighting the fact that I did not agree with the premise of the honourable member's question, because we have intervened. Many Tasmanians are being employed, there will be that extra capacity in terms of passengers and freight, and in a year's time they will be in service and it will be a very proud moment for all Tasmanians.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, I ask the Leader of the Opposition to allow the Premier to finish. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is important to note that on 25 July, TASCORP approved a temporary increase to the vessel replacement borrowing facility from $990 million to $1.4 billion until the 31 October 2026 plus the maintenance of the company's $45 million working capital facility. The then-treasurer provided the guarantee to TASCORP that the maximum amount guaranteed by the state for TT-Line increased to $1.45 billion.

The new board has been systematically working through the short-, medium- and long-term financial challenges. The directors and management, with the assistance from specialist advisers, continue to work on developing a range of long-term financial sustainability options for the government to consider. The Chair has advised that this work will be given the highest priority, and the advice will be presented to government in the coming months.

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Can the Premier point to what has changed for TT-Line's financial position for them to be able to meet their longer-term debt repayments? The loan facility increase happened before the Auditor-General's report.

The SPEAKER - That is really on the verge of a new question. If you go back to your original question on solvency - 

Mr WILLIE - It's related. I asked him to explain how they're solvent now. He didn't do it. 

The SPEAKER - That was the original question. You didn't use those words just then. 


TT-Line - Insolvency

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF.

[12.32 p.m.]
You've said you've intervened. TT-Line has not received any equity contributions, only an increase in its loan facility, which was made before the Auditor-General determined the company was insolvent. How can TT-Line trade solvently today? Are you saying that the Auditor-General is wrong? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. TT-Line has advice contrary to the Auditor-General. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - There were two parts to that. How can he be confident? He's saying that the company has advice; has he seen that advice? Is he saying that the Auditor-General is wrong? 

The SPEAKER - Honourable Premier. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I've gone through the director responsibility regarding solvency, and I don't need to repeat that now, but I'm very confident in the leadership, both at the CEO level and Chair level about solvency. We will never let TT-Line fall over because it's a government-owned business - 

Mr Willie - It's a state-owned company - 

The SPEAKER - Order. I ask the honourable Leader of the Opposition to stop interjections. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - and that's why we're working with TASCORP, Treasury, State Growth and TT-Line to ensure its future financial sustainability. 


Salmon Industry - Surveys Before Florfenicol Treatment 

Mr GEORGE question to MINISTER for ENVIRONMENT, Ms OGILVIE

[12.24 p.m.]
What baseline surveys were undertaken around all salmon pens in Tasmania before the industry was given the go-ahead to treat its diseased fish with a new antibiotic, florfenicol? Given the mounting evidence in Chile about the damaging impact of florfenicol on marine bacteria in wild fish, benthic health, and the general marine environment, what research has been undertaken by Australian marine scientists into the impact of florfenicol on marine life? How will the government monitor the impacts on our marine environment's health? Will the minister guarantee that impacts made by florfenicol are publicly revealed?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, there were a few questions in that question, and I will endeavour to answer them all. I will also just reflect; I think you did ask some of these questions in the recent briefing and we've committed to give you some answers there as well. I will sketch that for people to know that this is part of an ongoing dialogue. 

Our government has strengthened the Environment Protection Authority's (EPA) role as an independent regulator to ensure Tasmanian salmon industry operates sustainably and transparently through comprehensive environmental monitoring and regulation. It's important that we get that on the record. 

The EPA, as Tasmania's independent environmental regulator, has implemented rigorous monitoring of environmental impacts, including mortality waste, antibiotic use and dissolved oxygen levels. These measures are backed by science and collaboration with industry and community stakeholders. I'm advised, as I indicated at the beginning of this question, that the EPA has held comprehensive briefings with those members of parliament interested in their work. Indeed, I attended the briefing with Mr Peter George, where he asked similar questions. We have, I believe, already committed to provide you with some of that information, and I'm sure that will be forthcoming. 

I am also advised that we are continuing our investigation into the matters that occurred in 2025. It is important also to note that as a government we have a number of ministers and departments involved in this area. When it comes to public health matters, that's a matter for the minister for Health. The agriculture sector is a matter for the minister for Agriculture. 

You asked a couple of specific questions in relation to baseline surveys. I obviously don't have that to hand. I would be happy to ask that question, but if you could just remind me, I think you did already ask that in the briefing of the EPA.

Mr George - I'm asking you in parliament. 

Ms OGILVIE - I'm the minister for the EPA but I've said many times in this area: I do not direct the EPA. The EPA is an independent organisation. The question has been asked of the EPA, but I'd be happy to follow that up for you. Thank you.


TT-Line - Insolvency

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[12.37 p.m.]
You said you've intervened. Have you or your government sought or received any legal advice on whether TT-Line has been trading while insolvent? If so, will you table it?

Mr Mitchell - Go on. Take some responsibility. 

The SPEAKER - Order. Honourable member for Lyons, the question has been asked. I ask that interjections cease.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I will check the legal advice - 

Ms Finlay - You don't know if you've asked for advice? 

The SPEAKER - Order. Honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I've just asked for the interjections to cease. The Premier has only been on his feet for 10 seconds. Please allow him to answer the question. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - The directors' responsibility - that is their responsibility in terms of directors - I outlined their responsibilities before, of which I have every confidence in.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - It's extraordinary. The Premier doesn't know whether advice has been sought. Why not? 

The SPEAKER - Honourable Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I accept responsibility for all matters, as you know. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Interjections will cease or I will start warning members. I'm very conscious that it is the Leader of the Opposition's reply today. I encourage all opposition members to be quiet for the remainder of Question Time so that you can stay in the House for the leader's speech. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you. I said that I will seek some advice and inform the House as per your question. When it comes to the Audit Tasmania annual report of 19 August 2025, it states that:

In my opinion, the accompanying financial report of the company is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including giving a true and fair view of the company's financial position as at 30 June 2025 and of its financial performance for the year ended; 

B) complying with the Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporation's Regulations 2001. [tbc]

The SPEAKER - Honourable Premier's time has expired. To confirm, you will get some information on notice? 


Short-Stay Accommodation Levy - Government Policy

Mr BAYLEY question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ 

[12.40 p.m.]
At the 2024 state election, the government announced a policy to expand the stamp duty discount for first-home buyers and simultaneously promised this measure would be largely paid for by introducing a levy on short-stay accommodation. In September last year, the Greens asked for an update on the levy. The minister, Mr Ellis, told us that work was under way and the levy was, 'Actually really important because the revenue for this is committed to stamping out stamp duty.'

After handing down the Budget last week, your first press conference was promoting the results of your stamp duty policy. Still, the short-stay levy is nowhere to be seen and it's not listed in the Budget papers. Can you confirm the government has abandoned its short-stay levy policy? If so, why have you sacrificed $44 million in income when the budget is in such crisis?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, sorry to disappoint the Deputy Leader of the Greens, but I can't confirm that. In fact, it is still government policy and we have every expectation that it will be operational, subject to the parliament, as of 1 July 2026.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - A supplementary question, if I may. 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr BAYLEY - You're confirming that you haven't abandoned the short-stay levy policy, but it's just not implemented, is that correct? When will it be implemented, if that is the case?

Mr ABETZ - This is one of the problems when you have a supplementary question prepared without listening to the answer. I indicated:

It is still government policy; and

Subject to the parliament approving it, we have every expectation it will commence as of 1 July 2026.


TT-Line - Insolvency

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[12.42 p.m.]
You said you've intervened - this is the biggest infrastructure stuff-up in Tasmania's history and it keeps unravelling. Since finding out about the Auditor-General's determination, have you required TT-Line to provide updated solvency statements or financial assurances?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, the best of my advice is yes, but they've also had external advice contrary to the Auditor-General.

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Mr WILLIE - Is the Premier saying that the Auditor-General is wrong?

The SPEAKER - I remind the House that you cannot go down a new path of inquiry. If you want to ask a supplementary question, as I have said a number of times, it needs to accurately and actually relate to your original question. So if you go back to your original question -

Mr Willie - It asked about the Auditor-General's determination. Then I asked the Premier, as a supplementary, whether he was saying that Auditor-General was wrong.

The SPEAKER - That's the different part of the question, if you go back to your original question. Anyway, next question.


Budget - Funding for Youth Detention

Mr Di FALCO question to MINISTER for JUSTICE, CORRECTIONS and REHABILITATION, Mr BARNETT

[12.44 p.m.]
Can you confirm how much of the increased public order and safety funding in this year's Budget is associated specifically with youth detention and whether that amount is enough to meet staffing and rehabilitation needs?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question, much of which relates to the Minister for Children and Youth, but also there is a crossover there in terms of the justice system. I thank you for your question and your interest in that matter of youth justice and community safety.

For the government, that's a top priority for us, community safety. The Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Management has been very active in that space in bringing forward legislation and initiatives - just last week introduced Daniel's Law, or the week before - and we're very active in that space.

Regarding the corrections system, just to indicate that we have some $180 million in infrastructure upgrades over the forward Estimates. That's a very important initiative because we have to keep people safe in our community. We've invested in 257 new correctional officers. I want to say, as the Minister for Justice, Corrections and Rehabilitation, thank you. Thank you for your service to our correctional officers and the staff within our correctional system. It's really important.

You made reference to community safety. We are absolutely investing in initiatives too, in terms of electronic monitoring. There are different ways of keeping people safe, ensuring that those who do the wrong thing are treated and responded to in an appropriate way. It doesn't always have to be within the prison system. Regarding electronic monitoring, this is something that we have boosted as a government and will continue to do so. It's a really important initiative. 

However, with respect to related matters, I'd be more than happy to connect directly with the member for Lyons, Mr Di Falco, to respond to any queries that he has, and connect with the Minister for Children and Youth, and respond more directly with the honourable member.


Federal Government - Funding for Health Services

Prof RAZAY question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ, answered by PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[12.47 p.m.]
In your answer to the honourable member for Clark, you mentioned that our budget is going to experience a $670 million shortfall and that we should speak to the federal government to increase their contribution to our budget for health, which is well short of 45 per cent you are looking for. You also mentioned that there are many people waiting for nursing homes, which is part of the federal government. This has been going on for years.

How can we make federal government and state government work together and reach a really constructive solution? Our health system is struggling because it's an inefficient way to use our resources. I'm worried if we can't get an agreement, then it might lead to cutting our healthcare services.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his good question, and I agree with you. Federal and state governments should be working more solidly together when it comes to investment in healthcare. My view is, clearly, and the view of many other states, is that the federal government have invested. Successive governments have not invested enough when it comes to primary healthcare, for example access to GP services.

As a state government, we've had to reach in and invest in those areas of need ourselves, particularly our primary healthcare sector. Not only investment, which is dollars, but also freeing up red tape as well, such as allowing greater access to our pharmacies for example, and broadening the scope of practise.

The fact remains, however, to what the Treasurer's very good point was before, there was an agreement between all states and territory leaders in December 2023. That agreement pointed to an uplift for Tasmania of some $673 million more over the five-year period. It seems that the federal government has not lived up to that agreement, which is very disappointing. Had they lived up to that straight away we would have that $673 million more within our Budget to be able to support people in need. It is a two-way street. I had a good working relationship as health minister with Mark Butler, and we worked to ensure we had a single-employer model for GPs across Tasmania. I know minister Archer, who I'm representing today, also has a good working relationship with Mr Butler.

However, the federal government needs to take heed of every single state and territory which are united in the fact that the federal government needs to invest more in health and allowing, for example, the bed-block situation. We have far too many people that are ready for discharge in our hospitals who simply have no aged care placement, or no placement in a NDIS facility, for example. They need to do more. We're doing our bit, in fact, reaching into the primary healthcare sector and other areas, but you're right, we need to work together. The federal government has the responsibility to listen to all the states of all colours and come and meet us on that December 2023 agreement.


TT-Line - Insolvency

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[12.51 p.m.]
You said you had intervened, but the Auditor-General has determined TT-Line to be insolvent. According to TT-Line's annual report, in addition to increasing the company's credit facility with TASCORP, the government has also increased its guarantee to pay TT-Line's debt to TASCORP. How much is the guarantee for?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I want to repeat that the Tasmanian Auditor-General is entitled to his opinion and commentary. The fact is that TT-Line is solvent and the government will ensure its continued trading and operation. TT-Line has external advice to say that it is solvent, of course. The Chair himself has said:

The new board and CEO of TT-Line has been working closely with the Tasmanian government and particularly the Department of Treasury and Finance regarding the financial position of the company. The board is confident that the financial issues will be satisfactorily resolved.

Although it occurred outside the reporting period, TASCORP approved a temporary increase to the vessel replacement project facility in July 2025 until 31 October 2026. This temporary increase, in line with TT-Line's borrowing limit, will provide the company with the confidence it needs to continue its planned operations. Spirit of Tasmania is facing increases in capacity for both airlines and freight, leading to flat demand for services. The TT-Line board and CEO are focused on getting the new Spirit of Tasmania IV and V vessels into service in October 2026 and selling the existing vessels, addressing the substantial financial issues, improving safety both onboard and landside, establishing a new competitive positioning for the business, and reducing an unsustainably high cost base. [tbc]

I have every confidence in the Chair, the CEO, and the board.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker. 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - TT-Line is going to need more money. How much is the government's guarantee?

Mr ROCKLIFF - TASCORP's approval was subject to the receipt of written confirmation from the Treasurer under the Tasmanian Public Finance Corporation Act 1985 that the maximum amount guaranteed by the state for TT-Line is increased to $1.445 billion. This guarantee was given to TASCORP on 26 July 2025 in accordance with caretaker conventions. I'm advised that you were consulted on this.


Budget - Funding for Climate Change

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[12.54 p.m.]
Viewed rationally through the lens of global heating, your government's interim budget is a man-made disaster for this island and its people. While national and state climate risk assessments are telling your government the climate threat is pressing and requires urgent action, your budget prioritises over $600 million this next four years into a third stadium. At the same time, it underfunds our TFS, SES, Parks, and forestry firefighting services when we know more frequent and intense fires are threatening communities and major population centres like Hobart. As usual, the budget continues to prop up the logging and burning of carbon-bank native forests and funding to the Climate Office was slashed by more than $7 million a year. It is shameful and alarming. You've ignored experts again and prioritised a stadium over keeping Tasmanians safe from accelerating climate change. Why are you doing that?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for her question. There's a bit to unpack here in terms of social licence of language and Armageddon and all sorts of things that may have been mentioned. We take strong action on climate change. You mentioned our emergency services; we invested across various services enormously. Over $700 million to strengthen our emergency services' communications, which is an extraordinary amount, but also much needed in that sense. I thank minister Ellis for leading that particular reform and investment as well.

We were briefed yesterday about bushfire plans for this year and I have every confidence that the learning from successive events, including last year, will be highly valuable to our preparedness as well. We remain committed to taking strong action on climate change, as we have said many times, as Tasmania was the first Australian jurisdiction to achieve net-zero emissions and we have maintained that for the last nine years. Our government will continue activities to support what is a very impressive milestone and something that we and our forebears can be very proud of. 

To continue this good work, we have dedicated more than $9.5 million in this budget to support the work of the Climate Change Office in Renewables, Climate and Future Industries Tasmania (ReCFIT). The Climate Change Office works to deliver the important initiatives from Tasmania's climate change action plan and six sectoral emissions reduction and resilience plans. The emissions reduction and resilience plans have been developed to support greenhouse gas emissions reduction to assist our businesses and industries in the transition to a low-emissions economy and to build resilience to climate-related risks.

The action plan includes 98 practical cross-government actions that improve knowledge about climate change, reduce emissions, and build resilience to the changing climate. This plan builds on the significant investment of more than $250 million in climate change activities already underway across government, so our approach is a coordinated, whole-of-government response to climate change, and we believe in those matters very seriously.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - Honourable Speaker, the Premier said that our question was implying Armageddon. I said a disaster for this island and its people and that national and state climate-risk assessments are telling your government the climate threat is pressing and requires urgent action. Are you saying national and state assessments are over-egging the reality of the disasters that we are confronting and the real threats?

The SPEAKER - I say, again, that the Premier did give a substantive answer, so we just need to be careful about questioning. You can clarify, but don't take it down a new path of inquiry.

Dr Woodruff - It was clarification. He specifically used that term.

The SPEAKER - Honourable Premier. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Well, I did because every question you ask is Armageddon in nature and that we're about to confront the worst thing in the whole history of the world. That's the premise of all your questions, with respect. What I have already outlined to you is the fact that I reject the premise of your question because I have outlined a range of activities and a large amount of investment in this particular area.


R.A. Rodda Museum of Pathology - Unauthorised Human Remains

Mr GARLAND question to ATTORNEY-GENERAL, Mr BARNETT

[12.59 p.m.]
You sent me a letter on Monday last week, acknowledging the profound grief and trauma experienced by families affected by unlawful collection and display of autopsy samples in the R. A. Rodda Museum of Pathology. That letter included a very brief update. It is important that further details about how the government intends to respond to this distressing situation are put on the public record. Will you provide this parliament with a ministerial statement on the government's response to the Coroner's report? Can you please advise the date when this ministerial statement will be given so affected individuals can arrange to be in the parliament for it?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I acknowledge that and his interaction with me and my office, likewise, with other members in this Chamber who've contacted both me and the Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing directly. I thank you for your special interest in responding to the concerns of your constituents. They are very real and meaningful.

I confirm that the government's received and considered the Coroner's report. They are very troubling historical practices. I acknowledge how traumatic and devastating the recent coronial processes and revelations that have occurred have been for families. I have heard that, both first-hand and through the various MPs who have been in communication with affected families, and I have responded to that on behalf of the government.

As members are aware, the Magistrates Court, including the Coronial Division, is separate and entirely independent of government, and indeed the parliament. That is an independent statutory body, the Coronial Division, it operates free of any external influence, including political.

The Coroner has confirmed that between the 1950s and early 1990s, 177 specimens of human remains were retained without lawful authority or consent. I advise that following the release of the Coroner's report, I wrote to both the Director of Public Prosecutions and Tasmania Police to make them aware of the report, and for their consideration of this matter.

I further advise that the Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing has instructed her department to undertake further work to establish, as far as is possible, the identity of any employees within that department during the period of the 1950s through to the early 1990s, who may have been involved in the retention of remains without lawful authority or consent.

The government also intends to develop, in consultation with those affected, an appropriate form of parliamentary apology, which all members of this House and the other place will have the opportunity to acknowledge and contribute to. It is the intention of the government to provide a further update to parliament on this process and other actions I have mentioned before the end of the year. I can certainly advise on the relevant date, following further consultation with those families affected.

Finally, in May 2025, I announced a review of the Coroners Act 1995 to be conducted by the Tasmanian Law Reform Institute. I thank the institute for taking on that important work. I will be engaging with them directly on behalf of the government, including to ensure that families affected by this troubling matter have the opportunity to contribute to that review.

Time expired.


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Regional Breast Cancer Screening - Cost

Mr MITCHELL question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mrs ARCHER

[1.03 p.m.
The government continues to fail women living in regional Tasmania who require breast cancer screening. Gaye has been trying since August to apply for reimbursement for travel and accommodation that you said would be available after you took a mobile breast screening clinic off the road. More than two-and-half months later, Gaye still hasn't got a straight answer about who she should apply to and how long reimbursement will take. Why are women in regional Tasmania who need a breast cancer screening examination bearing the cost of your government's failure to manage the state's finances?


Tasman Highway Upgrade

Mr FERGUSON question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

My constituents in the north-east of Tasmania are extremely supportive of the government's plan to undertake the next stage of the Tasman Highway upgrade between Scottsdale and St Patricks River. Will the minister please advise me on the next steps to achieve this once in a lifetime upgrade for our north-east community?


Density Incentive Grant Scheme

Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

My question is on behalf of Tristan and is about the  [Bookmark: _Hlk213763100] Density Incentive Grant Scheme. Tristan writes as a concerned individual, not as a large corporation or a business, about the funds that he's put into his small but significant development. He raises several concerns about the department's poor notification process and the lack of consultation with stakeholders like himself, who have invested considerable time and resources in preparing the applications, but have not yet fully submitted them. He is a local developer committed to increasing housing supply and affordability in Launceston, and over the last 10 years has personally invested significant amounts of financial resources into this project.

A summary of his concerns are: the notification application status and impact on the program's closure, contradiction to government claims, and financial and policy implications. Given that, Tristan is asking that he has his application reconsidered and honoured under the original terms of the scheme, or at least be given an opportunity to complete and submit his existing application within the revised timeframes.


The Sand Enduro Race and Shorebird Breeding

Ms BADGER question to MINISTER for PARKS, Mr DUIGAN

My question is from constituents in St Helens who are pleased to see that Parks has backed zoning changes to prohibit dogs from a section of Dianas Basin and the St Helens Conservation Area, a move that will protect threatened nesting seabirds and shorebirds. These constituents are a little bit confused, however, as dogs are being prohibited in a part of a conservation area where vehicles are permitted to drive on the beach and the annual Sand Enduro race is held at the peak of bird breeding season. Is the Reserve Activity Assessment for the Sand Enduro race, which has already taken place, now complete? On the basis of consistently protecting these birds, will you at long last collaborate with event organisers to change the race date outside of the bird breeding season?


Mining Opportunities for the West Coast

Mr JAENSCH question to MINISTER for BUSINESS, INDUSTRY and RESOURCES, Mr ELLIS

The Prime Minister and the President of the United States recently signed an important agreement to secure supply of critical minerals and rare earths, backed by over $1 billion in new investments and supply chains across both nations. Given Tasmania's growing role in the production and processing of critical minerals, how will this agreement and investment make a difference on the ground for our mining industry and the communities of the west coast, in our electorate?


Ambulance Availability in Mole Creek

Ms BUTLER question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mrs ARCHER

On Sunday, a Mole Creek constituent sustained multiple injuries in a bike accident. Both arms, wrists and multiple teeth were broken, as well as a concussion and shock. An ambulance was called. Four hours later, Ambulance Tasmania advised they were not coming. A local resident drove the injured resident to Latrobe Hospital where she was treated, but no beds were available. At 1.30 a.m., the injured bike rider was driven back to Mole Creek. Why were no ambulances available on Sunday in Mole Creek? Does this pass the pub test?


Health Assessments in Emergency Waiting Areas

Ms ROSOL question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mrs ARCHER

A constituent has raised concerns with me about medical consultations being conducted in public waiting areas in the emergency department. They report that a family member was asked for personal health information while surrounded by other patients. Later, they overheard sensitive and traumatic details of another person's health issue as another assessment was undertaken in the waiting area. I have heard similar stories from many people and they all find the lack of privacy shocking and embarrassing. Why are patients being assessed in emergency department waiting areas that have no privacy? Is this practice reflective of hospital policy, a lack of available beds, or staffing pressures within our health system? What action will you take to ensure patients are afforded privacy during very personal health assessment?


Bus Services to Swanwick

Ms BADGER question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

My question is from constituents in Swanwick. The public bus route 744 currently goes along the main Coles Bay Road where there are no bus stops. However, in Swanwick itself, there is a perfectly good bus stop right outside the recreation ground. At the moment, school kids are being forced to wait on a main road. Will you expand public bus route 744 to go through Swanwick? It is not a particularly large area to drive through and is a rapidly expanding area where we are seeing more children. 

Will you expand the bus service through Swanwick and Coles Bay into the future? What are your plans? This is an area where there is also an ageing population that needs to be able to come to Hobart for medical appointments, to visit families, and an area where people would like to come to, to visit the national park by public transport as well.

Parliamentary Standing Committee of Public Accounts -TT-Line Spirits Project - Interim Report

[1.10 p.m.]
Mr JAENSCH (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I have the honour to bring up the following report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Public Accounts:

TT-Line Spirit of Tasmania Vessel Replacement Project Interim Report.

Report received.


MESSAGE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL

Assent to Bill

The SPEAKER - I am in receipt of a message from the Legislative Council:

The Legislative Council has this day agreed, without amendment, to a bill entitled A Bill for an Act to Amend the Expungement of Historical Offences Act 2017, C. Farrell, President, Legislative Council, 6 November 2025. 

The Legislative Council, having this day agreed, with amendments, to a bill entitled a Bill for an Act to amend the Residential Tenancy Act 1997 now returns the same to the House of Assembly and requests its concurrence therein. 

C Farrell, 
President, 
Legislative Council, 
6 November 2025.

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Treasurer) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the last mentioned message be taken into consideration at a later hour.

Motion agreed to.


MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Financial Management

[1.12 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House take note of the following matter: financial management.

I rise to talk about this important matter in the wake of the ferry fiasco. We know that the Premier has done everything possible not to take responsibility. He was happy to throw his colleagues under the bus. We had the member for Bass, the former treasurer and Infrastructure minister, who paid a high price, but the Premier seems to escape the scrutiny. It's not just in this area that he does that. We know that the Minister for Racing has been thrown under the bus so the Premier can keep his job. We also know the new Primary Industries minister was set up to implement a political witch hunt so the Premier could keep his job. 

However, on this matter, he can no longer escape scrutiny because he has told Tasmanians he has intervened. He has intervened in the ferry fiasco, which means that he is now taking personal responsibility for everything that happens from here. We know that this is a serious matter because the Auditor-General has determined that TT-Line is insolvent. I respect the Auditor-General; Martin Thompson does a great job for this state, and I would suspect his office would have had some serious deliberations around a determination like this because, knowing full well the ramifications for the company, the people involved, the directors and the government; it is a serious determination that the Auditor-General's office has made and this government gets no benefit of the doubt.

When they are questioning the Auditor-General's determination, I think many Tasmanians would say are you just going to take the TT-Line's word for it again? Again, without providing any evidence? I know who I trust, honourable Speaker; that's the independent oversight of the auditor in this state. This is a serious matter because, as a state-owned company, TT-Line is subject to the Corporations Act 1990 and its directors have a duty to prevent the company from trading or incurring debts if it is insolvent because it is a state-owned company, not a government business enterprise.

It is a state-owned company, it needs to comply with that act, that's how serious this is. We have a Premier who's now saying he's intervened; he's taking responsibility. We have serious question marks about this ongoing saga. We have an independent oversight body in the Auditor-General's office who has determined that the company is insolvent. In fact, what they said, and I will read the Auditor General's words in from yesterday because it's [Bookmark: Phr2_O=31.1_D=16.4_C=0.84]  important. He said:

During the conduct of my audit, I formed an opinion that TT-Line was likely to be able to meet its debts as and when they fall due, across the relevant period to August 2026.

Just to this year in August. 

Concurrently [Bookmark: Phr3_O=48.2_D=26.3_C=0.83] , I developed reasonable grounds to suspect that the company would not be able to meet its longer-term debts that fall due after the relevant period. 

As a result:

I issued my audit report on the 19 August 2025, at that date it was my opinion that TT-Line was insolvent.  [TBC]

A very serious determination from our independent oversight body, our Auditor-General. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=75.5_D=3.3_C=0.80]  There were some serious questions for the Premier today [Bookmark: Phr5_O=79.2_D=25.8_C=0.81]  in Question Time, and I think many people would be questioning whether he's across the issue or taking this seriously. It seems like he's taking the company's advice again in saying that they have independent advice to say that the company is solvent. He had to seek information; he had to take a question on notice to seek information, whether he had advice and what he has done to question the situation [Bookmark: Phr6_O=105.8_D=2.8_C=0.82] , whether he has sought further advice from the Auditor-General [Bookmark: Phr7_O=109.3_D=16.5_C=0.87]  and I think that's concerning. 

This government gets no benefit of the doubt when it comes to this issue. If it has breached the Corporations Act 1990, the company that is, that is a very serious matter and members of the government should take that seriously, including the shareholder minister over there. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=127.5_D=12.1_C=0.83]  To have this dismissed, that the Auditor-General is somehow wrong, without providing any evidence to the contrary, leaves the question begging. We will not stop holding this government to account on this matter [Bookmark: Phr9_O=140.2_D=22.5_C=0.82]  because this is starting to impact Tasmanians.

There's already a bailout in the state government Budget. We know that this ferry fiasco is going to cost a fortune, and there are more bailouts coming. This government is not being honest about the scale of the bailouts or the impact to Tasmanians because this has been the biggest infrastructure stuff up in Tasmania's history and it seems to continue.

[1.17 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Treasurer)  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=164.4_D=6.0_C=0.74] - Honourable Speaker, the Labor Party continues to bang the drum in relation [Bookmark: Phr11_O=170.9_D=25.4_C=0.81]  to the TT-Line. The government has acknowledged that there were, to put it very politely, suboptimal behaviours by previous management. I would use a lot stronger language. The Premier has acknowledged the issues and has gone about with his government and ministers to rectify them.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=197.2_D=3.3_C=0.71] Let's be exceptionally clear: the new board [Bookmark: Phr13_O=200.9_D=24.6_C=0.89]  of the TT-Line is a body of highly credentialed and professional individuals. They would not risk their professional reputation by trading in a company that is insolvent. The legal consequences for them would be huge. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=226.2_D=5.0_C=0.79]  They sought independent advice - as I understand it, from Alan Mitchell of HSF Kramer - [Bookmark: Phr17_O=254.5_D=16.3_C=0.88]  and, as a result, satisfied themselves that they were not insolvent. 

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=271.5_D=15.2_C=0.86] With respect to the Auditor-General, independent statutory authority office holder, came to a determination - that is for him to explain and that is fine. I would ask anybody [Bookmark: Phr19_O=286.9_D=9.7_C=0.84]  in this Chamber, or indeed outside of this Chamber: does anybody reasonably believe that [Bookmark: Phr20_O=297.2_D=7.4_C=0.90]  this company would be allowed to fail? Of course it wouldn't, and therefore its solvency and capacity to continue to pay debts will continue to be there.

As we speak, as I understand it, every single bill has been paid when it fell due. This is the TT-Line that is continuing to trade. What Labor unfortunately are seeking to do, which is always they wont, they talk Tasmania down. They talked down the TT-Line.

What that does then, is have consequences for the market. People then wonder, 'Oh, is it safe to book on the TT-Line,' courtesy of the denigration by the Labor Party, when everybody knows that this is a vital piece of infrastructure for our state that will continue to be supported and guaranteed by the government of the day, irrespective of its colour or hue. Mr Mitchell shakes his head. I dare say that indicates -

Mr Mitchell - I'm shaking my head at your cheek. Your refusal to accept reality.

The SPEAKER - Order, Mr Mitchell.

Mr ABETZ - that the Labor Party would not be backing in the TT-Line.

Members interjecting.

Mr ABETZ - Well we do, on this side of the Chamber. Speaker, the motion was allegedly about financial management. Well, the way that Labor left the books when we came to office with the superannuation liability -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The Treasurer has the floor.

Mr ABETZ - Over $1.5 billion raided out of an account, and still they had to sack nurses, police and teachers to try to cobble together some sort of a budget. I indicate that we as a government are into financial management big-time, not only for the TT-Line but across all the government's endeavours. We seek to provide sound administration of the monies that we collect for and on behalf of the people of Tasmania.

Let's be very clear: in relation to TT-Line, there is no suggestion that it is or will be insolvent. 

Mr Mitchell - Or was?

Mr ABETZ - It never was insolvent. It continued to pay its bills when and as they fell due and they have sufficient money in store.

Time expired.

[12.22 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to make the Greens' contribution to this topic of financial management. I have to say, as much as I like seeing the Liberal and Labor parties slugging it out across the parliament about their own perspectives when it comes to financial management, we have to take into account that the TT-Line saga has been an absolute fundamental fiasco. It's a gift that keeps giving to the opposition, it's really clear.

The thing that just beggars' belief in the context of the big debates that this parliament is having is how the Labor Party can endorse the stadium and back in the stadium because if we think the Spirits is bad enough, the stadium is going to be the Spirits on steroids. We look forward to having that debate in substance later on down the line.

Failure really characterises financial management from this government over the last 10 years; ideological failure, policy failure, and of course priorities as well. Starting with the ideology, which we heard again today in Question Time as a response, that you can grow your way out of this problem, that 'We've got to build this stadium because it's going to grow the economy'. That's the Treasurer speaking directly counter to the advice of his own treasury in the Pre-Election Financial Outlook (PEFO). Let me read from page 2 in the PEFO the key findings:

The State Budget has a structural problem. Economic growth correlates weakly with general government sector revenue growth in Tasmania. Accordingly, this structural problem will not be resolved through future economic growth. Explicit policy choices are needed. [tbc]

It's there in black and white, Treasurer. You can't grow yourself out of this problem and you need to make other difficult decisions that you're not willing to, to fix this problem, and that starts with avoiding unnecessary spending like on third billion-dollar stadium at Macquarie Point.

The problems here go deeper though, because there are the personal ideologies as well. We know the Treasurer believes in smaller government. We know he believes in not passing on intergenerational debt, but he's willing to put that one aside for the moment, and it's an absolute fail. The other fundamental failure when it comes to policy is not being willing to raise additional revenue; not being willing to make big corporations pay their fair share, tax some of the industries that are paying less than the average mainland rates, and raise revenue so that we can spend it on the services that Tasmanians need and deserve. 

While the Treasurer fundamentally refuses to rule out raising revenue, he keeps pointing to this failed ideology of growing our way out of this problem. It's just simply not going to work. Saul Eslake has been abundantly clear that we need big policy change. He says that the situation we're in at the moment is all about policy decisions. It's about too much pork-barrelling during election time, it's about not being willing to raise revenue, and it's about debt; continuing to debt fund projects. 

The Greens found a billion dollars of savings in our election commitments. We identified $900 million worth of additional revenue raising, and, when you took into account the new spending that we identified to support the community to meet some of the needs that they are crying out for, the budget would be $1.4 billion better off. Budgets are about policy as well and about priority. What we're seeing in this budget are issues around health, housing, child safety and literacy not being addressed. We're seeing the financial commitment from the state fall off a cliff going forward, and that's at a time when the current system is not meeting the needs of Tasmanians already. 

Debt is out of control, and debt is a real risk to our credit rating. If our credit rating does get reduced, then the cost of servicing that debt is going to be even more expensive; $7 billion by the end of next year or by the end of the financial year, $10 billion by the end of the 2029 financial year, and Saul Eslake predicts that it could get as high as $16 billion in 2035. It could be even worse than that. 

Of course, the stadium is central in this conversation. The figure of $1.8 billion over the next 10 years is an estimate based on the $945 million construction cost. We know that's blown out to $1.13 billion, and that's not the end of it. We, the taxpayer, are on the hook for every single one of those cost blowouts.

Prof Gruen said it shows all the hallmarks of mismanagement. Treasury has identified that there are significant risks when it comes to the cost estimates and that it is likely - or it could possibly - blow out, and the Tasmanian Planning Commission is absolutely unequivocal that we should not build it. It's going to cost us tens of millions of dollars every year simply to service the debt, let alone pay it off. 

[1.27 p.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to talk about this matter of public importance because it is absolutely critical, especially to the north-west economy. What is going on with TT-Line? This saga just continues and continues. The financial management of this operation has certainly got big questions to answer.

We have the independent Auditor-General of Tasmania saying, in his report, that TT- Line was insolvent on 19 August this year. This is an independent auditor saying that on 19 August TT-Line was insolvent. What do we hear from the Premier, who, I have to remind people, said that he had intervened and this project was back on track? A few months after that, 19 August, the Auditor-General says TT-Line is in effect broke. What does the Premier do? He just accepts it.

TT-Line has apparently received independent advice that says otherwise - that says they're not broke - and the Premier just accepts it. We've been here before. We've stood in this place and we've asked question after question after question about TT-Line, and all we get are assurances that everything is just fine. Remember the wharf? Remember the berthing facilities in Devonport? We were assured that everything was on track; everything was on track because TT-Line said it was on track. It turned out to be a complete disaster; a massive blowout in its budget, and still not completed. Now, we have TT-Line insolvent on 19 August.

We also know that this state has forked over $75 million as a bailout to TT-Line. We also know that TT-Line has more debt to go. The $75 million bailout must be just keeping their head above water, because we know that TT-Line has to take on more debt. The debt facility isn't fully extended and yet they were insolvent on the 19 August, according to the Auditor-General. We know that they'll be taking on more debt and they'll be having more expenses. That means TT-Line is going to need even bigger bailouts. Now, why can't this government and this premier, who has intervened apparently, just be honest with Tasmanians and give us a full and frank update of where TT-Line is at? 

Instead, we're going to come into this place in maybe another couple of months' time when the government announces that TT-Line needs another bailout. Why can't they just be honest right now? What sort of management of the finances is this state and Premier doing? They could be honest. TT-Line, their balance sheet - if you pardon the pun - is absolutely taking on water. They have these new ships; they have to be staffed. They have to be fuelled, they're running fuel, they're burning fuel, and they have to be parked somewhere. This is costing TT- Line money every single day. 

What we're hearing now from the annual report of the TT-Line is that their income is down. Their income from their current ships is down. They've got less income, and they've got more expenses. The Auditor-General says they are insolvent, the government is having to bail them out, and now we hear everything is just fine. Apparently, there is independent advice that the Premier is relying on, and he just accepts it. 

Well, we know that the situation is not fine. TT-Line is 100 per cent going to need another bailout. Treasurer, you know that the TT-Line is going to need another bailout. You absolutely know it. Why can't you be upfront and give us a true picture of TT-Line's position instead of us having to drag it out of you, kicking and screaming, question time after question time? We will have weeks of denials and then there'll be a press release saying, 'Oh, by the way, they need another $100 million.' Just be honest with the people of Tasmania, we've had to drag this out of you every single step of the way. 

The Premier says he's intervened. What have we got? Bailouts. We've got more stuff-ups, and the government is not being honest. Why can't you just be honest with the Tasmanian people, Treasurer? Why can't the Premier just be honest?

Independent advice, are you serious? How can you be sure, Treasurer, that they are solvent? Are you sure that they are solvent? Because you're going to get a tap on the shoulder in a couple of weeks saying, 'By the way, we need another 100 million bucks to stay afloat.' This is just not good enough.

[1.32.p.m.]
Mr JAENSCH (Braddon) - Deputy Speaker, here go again with Labor. They did this last week as well. What they will do is grab any line from a reporter, a headline that they think they can make some hay from and roll it out and try to use it to smear the capabilities or intentions or the responsibilities of this government. This Premier and government has intervened, has taken responsibility to address a great range of challenges facing our state's essential ferry service as it undergoes significant changes in its assets, equipment and its ports and operations as it confronts a series of failures of management and governance, which are laid out in the report that I tabled here today and are subject to a review and inquiry, which is ongoing and will yield more detail. 

As it did last week, Labor again seeks to wrap this up in party-political spin to try to question the government's capability, willingness to take responsibility and the effectiveness of its interventions. I will just reiterate here for everyone who is listening, the government's interventions have taken a number of different forms, including forcing the organisations involved in the management of TT-Line at various stages, as the reports tabled today will show, to work better together to bring in integrators, to bring in independent oversight and coordination; to bring about the change of leadership of those organisations, the resignations of key people with responsibilities for not avoiding some of the failures that have been reported; increasing the borrowing limit of TT-Line; delivering an equity injection when it's been shown to be needed. 

As the Treasurer, the shareholder minister and the Premier have said today, this government will continue to invest and take action and to intervene where needed to ensure the future sustainability of this state-owned company. It is a state-owned company, but in any general assessment, Tasmanians see this as a critical piece of infrastructure and service for Tasmanians and for our economy and for our industries.

Under very slightly different circumstances, this might not be classified as a state-owned company, but as part of essential government infrastructure and services. It could be a government department. If in those circumstances, the government needed to inject additional money from time to time to ensure the service was delivered and to ensure that it was done affordably, I could imagine we'd be in a position where the Labor opposition would be insisting that we ran the whole thing at a loss so that we could make it more affordable for people to go on with their caravans and to bring freight. 

These are the sorts of things that could happen under a very slightly different set of circumstances. What we heard today from the Treasurer and the Premier is that we know this is a special essential piece of infrastructure and service for Tasmania. It is a state-owned company.

We will and we have been and we will continue to do what's needed to ensure that it continues to operate, that it continues to operate sustainably, and that we will apply assistance from the state where we need to ensure that, as any owner of any business would when a business is going through a challenging time upgrading its infrastructure, owning four ships while only two of them are earning any revenue, running those ships, the existing ships, at times a sub-economic model in order to be able to meet demand by running extra day sailings et cetera, upgrading two significant ports to receive the new ships.

This is a very complex period for the financial operations of any company, and it is reasonable at these times that the owner of the company intervenes. Accepts greater borrowing risk, provides more equity to ensure that the business can trade through. This is what a state-owned company and its state owners do on behalf of their people to ensure a service like this can continue.

Labor will have you believe today that any question or questioning ever of the solvency or risk of insolvency of a company like this is evidence of government failure or mismanagement -

Members interjecting. 

The SPEAKER - Order. The only one who should be speaking is the minister.

Mr JAENSCH - The matters to do with delays, the provision and the costing of wharf infrastructure and ships, is a matter for the Public Accounts Committee inquiry, and you will see the details today.

Time expired.

[1.37 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I thank Labor for bringing this MPI on in relation to financial management, and they have raised the issue of what was writ large in the Auditor-General's report tabled today in this House. It recognised the likely insolvency, named it up, insolvency of TT-Line. Able to pay debts in the short term, but in the long term there is the issue of insolvency for our major carrier of freight and business and tourism to this state.

We know as the Leader of the Opposition and members of the opposition have raised time and time again, and they remind us, that this has been the state's major infrastructure stuff-up in Tasmanian history. It certainly rings alarm bells for all of us, or it should. But when we heard this morning from the Premier it was about denial.

There was an Auditor-General's report, and one listens to the Auditor-General or should be listening to the Auditor-General and taking heed. However, quite often, unfortunately, it seems the Premier's behest, and some other members of the government, to deny that advice that's writ large in that report. We've seen various other reports and other economic commentators, like Saul Eslake, raising concerns about the Budget. We as the Greens, as Mr Bayley has already said, are very concerned about this budget, as is Deloitte's Mr Hodges, and there has been comment on the Budget. If we go back to the Auditor-General's report, and I don't believe Labor has talked about this, but it's the debt-to-equity ratio which is also of concern. 

If you look at one of the tables in that report, there is a 209 per cent debt-to-equity ratio and concern for TT-Line Company. There are $894 million of borrowings and over $56.5 million dollars will be interest paid on that. That is significant. What I'd like also to point out, and we've talked about the biggest infrastructure stuff-up in Tasmanian history, but I put a caveat on that, what about saying, naming this up as the biggest infrastructure stuff-up to this date? What about the stadium, and what about the likelihood of this being the biggest white elephant and the biggest millstone around Tasmania's neck?

I feel sorry for the Treasurer who's just about to leave the Chamber. I feel I have a modicum of sorrow to you, Treasurer, because it's as if you've inherited an intergenerational debt from your forebear, the previous treasurer, who has handed you this dud of a budget from May that didn't get delivered, but this is an intergenerational treasurer's debt and concern because the Treasurer has had to put the Budget together. Mark my words, and the Greens have been saying it loud and clear: this stadium will be of significant concern for financial management and mismanagement of the state.

[1.42 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, in relation to the Auditor-General of Tasmania who's just audited our state-owned companies and GBEs, the Premier said, 'He's entitled to his opinion,' as though the Auditor-General of Tasmania had just selected his preferred XI for the Ashes or something like that. The Auditor-General's opinion when it comes to the auditing of the financials of our government businesses, in particular TT-Line in this case, is really important and fundamental to the governance structures of the way government businesses actually operate. It is not something to simply say, 'Oh well, he's entitled to his opinion.' It's his opinion which has been required by law, not just state law but also by corporations' law federally, it is an opinion which is informed by decades of experience.

This is an Auditor-General who the government outlined when they appointed him - and I will read from the former treasurer, now member for Bass, Mr Ferguson:

The Rockliff Government is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr Martin Thompson as the new Auditor-General of Tasmania, effective 1 May 2024.

He said:

With 30 years' of extensive experience in the provision of audit and insurance services, Mr Thompson is a highly qualified professional who has served in senior roles with distinguished organisations such as the Australian National Audit Office and the Victorian Auditor-General's Office. [tbc]

It goes on. The question that the Treasurer put to the House earlier was: do we really think the board would risk their reputation? Do we really think that Martin Thompson, the Auditor-General of Tasmania who is required by law to audit this organisation and required by corporations law to determine whether this company is solvent or not, would risk his? No, he wouldn't. It is not something, as the Premier did just sort of push away and say, 'Oh, well, he's entitled to his opinion.' It's actually something really fundamental to the governance structures of government businesses, which of course is where the biggest failures of this government have been - our government businesses. TT-Line is fundamental to freight, to tourism, to this state, and it is 'taking on water', to borrow a phrase from my friend.

It is almost under water. This is a huge problem for the state, and it is going to require further cash to bail it out. I am concerned about the lack of interest, frankly, from the Premier of Tasmania earlier today, as he sort of wished it away. I'm concerned about the idea that if you don't like the Auditor-General of Tasmania's opinion, you can just go and get another one. I trust the Auditor-General of Tasmania. I'm not sure that's a controversial thing. I don't think it is still today. This House must have trust in the Auditor-General. If we are to have trust in the institutions and government structures of the state, all of us must treat the Auditor-General's advice very seriously and accept it.

However, the government doesn't. Today, the Premier of Tasmania effectively said, 'He's entitled to his opinion,' but he prefers another one. I prefer the Auditor-General of Tasmania's opinion. I trust what he has said, and I trust the evidence he has provided within his excellent report. It does talk, as the Greens member for Clark said earlier, about the debt-to-equity ratio and we've seen other government businesses have very high debt-to-equity ratios over the last few years, primarily TasNetworks. However, none of them have ever come into this problem where the Auditor-General of Tasmania is raising these sorts of concerns. This isn't an issue that's going to go away. 

Further, it's not an issue of negativity. What other state and what other government would ever have taken an issue so seriously like this, and then to their political opponents, stood back, pointed across the Chamber and said, 'You're just so negative? All we did was forget to build a berth for the ship. All we did was bail out a finished ship company with $80 million of Tasmanian taxpayer money and didn't tell anyone. All we did was see the project go $400 million over budget. That's all. Then, all we did was send Tasmania's premier freight company broke.' That's all they did. Those of us on this side need to stop being negative. That's what they say - we should just be more positive about this. Bravo for bailing them out with $75 million so far. Look forward to the next bailout, which will definitely happen in the next budget as part of the black hole that's been brought on by our new Treasurer, the fourth in 12 months.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 2025 (No. 63)

Second Reading 

Continued from 6 November 2025 (page xx).

[1.47 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, it is an honour to rise today to respond to this budget, my first as leader of the Labor Party and leader of the opposition. It is a privilege to stand here representing Tasmanians across our state, from the west coast to the east, from the north to the Huon. People who work hard, look after their families, and love this place dearly. As Labor leader, I take this responsibility seriously. After 11 long years of Liberal rule, Tasmanians deserve something better. I rise to respond to the third budget in just over a year, delivered by a third different Treasurer.

After the member for Bass, Michael Ferguson, delivered his 2024-2025 effort, he was asked by a news presenter whether he was the worst Treasurer Tasmania had ever had. He didn't answer the question then, but thanks to the former treasurer and now Attorney-General, Guy Barnett's, efforts, who will go down in history as a treasurer who couldn't pass a budget through the parliament, the member for Bass can now answer that no, he wasn't.

Now, we have Treasurer Abetz. If you travel back in time and told Tasmanians on the street that Eric Abetz will end up becoming Treasurer, I reckon you would get some pretty interesting responses, because Eric Abetz doesn't come to the job with a clean slate. Tasmanians know his staunchly conservative views. They know how he feels about same-sex marriage and abortion rights. They know he hates debt, and they know how he wants to get rid of it. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=13.8_D=17.9_C=0.79]  Tasmanians remember his record in Canberra - 14,000 jobs gone and deep cuts to public services. Now he's been handed the state's cheque book, and Tasmanians know exactly what that means: more cuts, poorer services and more pain for working people.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=32.5_D=14.0_C=0.89] When the Liberals came to office in 2014, there was money in the bank, but after 11 years they have taken Tasmania from having no net debt to the worst finances of any state or territory [Bookmark: Phr4_O=47.7_D=5.9_C=0.89]  and, after all that time, Tasmanians are still getting less for every dollar spent [Bookmark: Phr5_O=54.4_D=8.8_C=0.89] . They are spending more but achieving less. The government says it's investing in education and health, but outcomes are worse. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=64.1_D=7.8_C=0.86]  More money, worse results because they do not listen to the workers who deliver the services, and those workers have had enough.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=72.6_D=10.9_C=0.89] This budget shows net debt rising to $10.4 billion by the end of the forward Estimates, with interest payments averaging over $500 million every year [Bookmark: Phr8_O=84.8_D=13.2_C=0.91] . That is almost $2 billion over the next four years that won't create a single job, educate a single Tasmanian student, provide a single hospital bed or build a single house.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=98.8_D=10.6_C=0.77] The Liberals aren't using debt to build the future. They've pork-barrelled and lurched from scandal to scandal into this situation all by themselves [Bookmark: Phr10_O=110.4_D=24.4_C=0.73] . Through sheer incompetence and mismanagement, this government has spent over $500 million to cover cost blowouts that pushed TT-Line to insolvency and triggered a $75 million bailout from the pockets of Tasmanian taxpayers; an $80 million bailout payment to a Finnish shipbuilder; a $400 million cost blowout for berth 3 at Devonport; a $13 million blowout on the price of ships [Bookmark: Phr11_O=135.5_D=3.8_C=0.72] , $5.9 million and counting in Scottish storage fees [Bookmark: Phr12_O=140.0_D=5.9_C=0.86] ; and $9 million for hull and fender upgrades when the ships haven't even spent a day in service [Bookmark: Phr13_O=147.1_D=16.6_C=0.88] . That is $500 million a year lost in economic activity for the state, and now the bailout for TT-Line. I have no doubt there is more to come.

The Treasurer claims this is an interim budget. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=164.3_D=4.2_C=0.78]  Well, if this is a warm-up act, Tasmanians should be terrified for the main event [Bookmark: Phr15_O=169.7_D=7.7_C=0.86]  because the real cuts, the job losses, the service reductions, the pain are all baked into next year's budget. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=178.2_D=5.4_C=0.88]  Departments were ordered to find $300 million from public services that are already stretched thin. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=184.8_D=2.6_C=0.88]  Now they have been ordered to find 'efficiencies [Bookmark: Phr18_O=188.2_D=11.2_C=0.76] ' to pay for pay rises for teachers and nurses. That means cuts to services, staff, and to support for the people who keep this state running.  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=200.6_D=19.0_C=0.73] It is straight from playbook Mr Abetz used in Canberra when he sacked 14,000 public servants and boasted about it. He calls it right-sizing, but Tasmanians know that that means fewer teachers, nurses, and child-protection workers, and worse outcomes for them.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=220.3_D=15.7_C=0.84] The Liberals got us into this mess through poor management and wasteful decisions. Now the Liberal Party, propped up by the Greens and Independents, have put Mr Abetz in charge of cleaning it up by slashing the very services that Tasmanians rely upon. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=237.3_D=7.6_C=0.89]  Tasmanian workers have spoken loud and clear on this budget. It does absolutely nothing for them.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=245.6_D=8.4_C=0.81] The Tasmanian Council of Social Service (TasCOSS) is deeply concerned about what this means for the community sector and those in our community who are vulnerable [Bookmark: Phr23_O=255.2_D=8.7_C=0.89] . Where are the industry groups coming out in support of this budget? Usually, they can find something positive to say. Absolute cricket [Bookmark: Phr24_O=265.1_D=4.3_C=0.86] s. This budget fails to deal with Tasmania's biggest crises [Bookmark: Phr25_O=270.0_D=11.0_C=0.87]  - health, housing, education, and the growing number of young people leaving the state in search of better opportunities because they can't see a future here and that is a tragedy for all of us. [Bookmark: Phr26_O=282.5_D=7.4_C=0.85]  This budget is proof that after 11 long years, this tired Liberal government has run out of puff, and it's run out of ideas. [Bookmark: Phr27_O=291.1_D=3.7_C=0.79] 

I also want to talk about what's missing from this budget. [Bookmark: Phr28_O=295.8_D=7.9_C=0.75]  After rolling out all the merch, the hats, the jackets, the balloons, the shopfront - who can forget the fake shopfront in Launceston [Bookmark: Phr29_O=304.1_D=0.9_C=0.29]  - TasInsure? The Premier's signature election policy has disappeared. This Premier promised struggling Tasmanian families savings of $250 on their premiums and he even promised to make groceries cheaper. It was never real, it was just a stunt to win votes. It was a cruel election hoax. TasInsure tells Tasmanians everything they need to know about this government. It is a marketing department masquerading as a government. More spin doctors than ministers and more scandals than solutions. They over-promise, under-deliver, and blame everyone except for themselves.

After 11 years, this government cannot tell Tasmanians the truth. The Premier might be a nice bloke, but when you are leading the state, words actually matter. The only thing real about this government is its capacity to let Tasmanians down. Election commitments worth hundreds-of-millions of dollars are not in this budget. Either they are commitments that will never be delivered or they will add hundreds-of-millions of dollars to Tasmania's debt.

The Premier has written to community groups and local organisations, telling them that their election commitments will have to wait until next year's budget. If you have a letter from Mr Rockliff promising you something next year, you should be worried. Whatever you do, don't frame it and don't take it to the bank, because we've all seen what this Premier's promises are worth. Just ask the salmon and greyhound-racing industries. Ask his colleagues.

Tasmanians deserve a better government. Government should run on purpose and ideas. They should lead the way to the future. For a time, I concede that this one did. When a government runs out of talent, ideas and direction, it is time to go. When they start failing Tasmanians, as they have in managing the budget, the economy and supporting communities with health, education and housing. When they are incompetent, as they have been with the Spirits of Tasmania. And, when instead of focusing on Tasmanians, their sole priority becomes holding onto power, they need to go. That is this government - 11 years old, tired, divided and directionless. It happened to the Morrison government, it happened to the Howard government and I concede that it has happened to Labor governments. There comes a time when every government runs out of puff and this one is absolutely gasping for air.

Post-election bargaining with the Greens and independents has broken trust with Tasmanians. Members who once stood proudly for their communities have been forced to abandon them. A Racing minister forced to shut down an industry she promised to protect just to keep this Premier in his job. A new Primary Industries minister whose first order of business was to set up a politically motivated review into the state's largest primary producer, just to keep him in his job. Under this Liberal-Greens arrangement, no job is safe and no promise is guaranteed. The government's only purpose is survival and the Greens only exist to shut ideas down.

The government stands for nothing and it is fragile because it has sold its soul. That's why they have stitched up deals with the protest parties who stop things instead of building them. Tasmanians deserve a better government. They haven't been able to turn to Labor and that's something we need to change.

In my first few months as Leader of the Labor Party, I have travelled from one end of this beautiful state to another. Queenstown, Zeehan and Strahan on the west coast; Burnie and Devonport in the north-west; Derby and Scottsdale in the north-east - I've been to Launceston, where I grew up, every week - I went to Triabunna and St Helens on the east coast; Kingston, the Huon Valley, Geeveston and Dover in the south; and even to Flinders Island. Everywhere I go, I hear the same message from Tasmanian families, 'Life is getting harder.' People tell me about the rising cost of groceries and rent, and about waiting months or sometimes years for healthcare. They tell me about their kids moving interstate because they can't find a job or afford a home. These aren't isolated stories, they are the lived reality of thousands of Tasmanians.

Teachers tell me they're paying for classroom supplies out of their own pockets. Facility attendants tell me their workloads have become impossible and the government won't listen to them. Nurses tell me that they're burnt out, but still turning up because their patients need them. Young Tasmanians tell me they love this state, but they're not sure it loves them back.

The Labor Party believes governments should spread opportunity among people and be aspirational for the future. I believe opportunity is spread through education. I didn't come to politics through a party machine; I came here through the classroom. I was a primary school teacher, like my mum and dad before me. They taught me that education is the most powerful tool we have to change lives. It is not about lessons and exams; it's about shaping futures. Every day I saw how the right opportunity could change a child's life. That's why education is not just another policy area for me; it is who I am, and it will be at the heart of everything I lead Labor to do.

One student I'll never forget is Maya, who is here in the gallery with us today. I taught Maya about a decade ago when she was in my grade 6 class. Maya has Down syndrome and, like so many Tasmanian kids, she spent time in both the education and health systems. She experienced the best and worst parts of our education system, but at its best, it was transformative and empowering for her. Maya wanted what every child wants: friendship, belonging and a future to look forward to. More than that, she was given the tools to make it happen, and she didn't waste a second of it. Maya had teachers who believed in her and a school community that wrapped around her. She was very much the school celebrity and she loved it. Her mother, Sandy, who's here today with Maya, gave so much of herself to ensure her daughter had the opportunity to reach her potential and become who she wants to be.

Sandy is the first to acknowledge the challenges that Down syndrome present to her and Maya; but importantly, she also speaks about the gifts it gives to all of those around her, too. The way Maya walks into the world is truly something special. Her days are driven by this incredible strength of will and unbridled curiosity for whatever life may hold for her future. The people who support, empower, and love Maya are equally touched and changed by her kind nature and the purity of her joy. I certainly was. 

If you talk to Sandy, she will tell you about how powerful having the right education environment at the right time was for both Maya and herself. She took great comfort in knowing that Maya was surrounded by people with the time, resources, and compassion to provide for her daughter's needs, while also valuing the meaningful contribution Maya made to their own lives. It gave Sandy respite from the worry of a wrong environment and it helped Maya overcome her anxiety, so she could truly explore who she is. Good education helped to give Sandy and Maya agency in shaping their future.

Over the years I have stayed in touch with Maya and her family, including visiting her in hospital in a group of her old teachers after a very serious operation. All these years later, I often think about her school experience. Seeing what education did for Maya reminds me why I got into politics in the first place, because every child, no matter their circumstances, deserves the same things: the right support, the right opportunities and a future that they can look forward to here in Tasmania.

I look at what's happening in our schools today, I hear from my former colleagues, and I worry that too many children like Maya are being left behind again. Teachers are burnt out and they are crying for help. They recently lost confidence in the Education minister to support them. Support staff are stretched to breaking point. I know those classrooms; I've been in them. I've seen the transformative power of education in our public schools, and I've seen what happens when a government stops listening; when opportunity dries up; when young Tasmanians start looking interstate for a future that they should have here. Education changed Maya's life and it can change Tasmania's future, too. That's why I will always fight for it.

Services are in decline everywhere. Schools, hospitals and community organisations are stretched to breaking point, and they're only held together by the extraordinary Tasmanians working in them. Years of Liberal rule have left Tasmanians with less opportunity and an uncertain future. This government's best days are behind them, and Tasmanians need to be able to turn to Labor for a future they deserve.

Labor is the party of public education, universal healthcare, affordable housing, fair wages and secure jobs. Labor governments build things for Tasmanians. We built the Hydro, we built Basslink, we built our first wind farms and irrigation schemes. We bought the first Spirits of Tasmania on time and on budget. We built child and family centres and introduced launching into learning. Labor didn't just promise things, we delivered. We are the party of responsible budgets and ambitious ideas. When Labor governs, Tasmanians do better. Those opposite see government as something to just manage and sell off. Labor believes governments should lift people up.

Today marks 50 years since the dismissal of Gough Whitlam, one of the towering figures in our party's history and in our country's story. Whitlam understood that the government's job is not to withdraw from people's lives but to expand the horizons of what's possible. He believed in free education, universal healthcare, equal opportunity for women and a fair go for working people. The Whitlam government changed our nation forever. It opened the gates of our universities, built what is now known as Medicare, recognised First Nations Australians, and gave people hope and pride in the country and what it could be. Those values - fairness, inclusion and opportunity - are the same values that drive the party I lead today. That's what Labor has always stood for, and it's what will stand for again: a government that builds, includes and believes in the power of education and the community to transform lives. 

When I talk with parents, people like Sandy, who raised Maya with love and determination, I hear the same quiet worry beneath every conversation. What kind of Tasmania will our children inherit? Parents don't expect life to be easy. They work hard, they make sacrifices and do everything they can to make sure their kids have a better life and to get ahead, but they want to know the state will do its part too, that the government will back them in. They want a Tasmania where their children can dream big and stay close to home; where good education leads to a good job; where owning a home isn't out of reach; where healthcare is there when their family needs it; and where, no matter your postcode, you could build a life with dignity and purpose. That's not too much to ask. It's what every parent wants: security, opportunity and hope for their children's future. It's what I want for my three children when they grow up.

Right now, too many Tasmanian parents feel like they're doing it alone. They're being asked to carry the cost of government failure. It doesn't have to be this way. Tasmania can be a place where every family in every corner of the state feels supported, where a child born in Ravenswood, Brighton or Latrobe has the same chance as a child born in Sydney, Melbourne or anywhere else in Australia. That's what Tasmanian Labor wants to build, a state that gives every child a fair go and every parent the confidence that their hard work will be enough to give their family a future. Tasmanians can have a better future - here. We have all the ingredients - renewable energy, world class produce, clever people, proud communities and people who care deeply about this place.

We are a state of creativity and innovation, from MONA to local festivals that fill our small towns, from artisans and musicians and makers who share their stories with the world. Creativity isn't a luxury in Tasmania; it's part of who we are. Our arts and culture don't just enrich our lives, they attract visitors, grow jobs and showcase the best of us to the world. Tourism is one of the Tasmania's greatest success stories, built not by governments spin but by the hard work of local operators, guides, producers and small businesses who make our island one of the most sought-after destinations on the Earth.

They remind us that Tasmania's future lies in playing to our strengths. We can harness our clean energy advantage to create jobs and opportunities for future generations right here. We can power jobs and opportunity in our own backyard. We can use our strength to make Tasmania an economic powerhouse for the country once again. 

What we need now is a government with purpose, leadership that builds, not blames. Tasmanians need a Labor government from a Labor Party back at its best. We know Tasmanians have lost faith in politics. We're not just going to ask for their trust, we're going to earn it. We will outwork this government, we will hold them to account and, when the time comes, we will be ready. We will ensure every Tasmanian can reach their potential through quality education that begins in the early years and continues through school and into vocational education and university. We will manage the budget responsibly, so services are reliable and no one is left behind.

This government has no plan for the future. They have run out of steam. They lurch from one mess to the next, and I make this promise to Tasmanians today: when that stumble becomes a fall, Labor will be ready. We will have done the work, built the trust and earnt the right to govern again. 

Tasmanians told us in July they didn't think we were ready to govern, and we heard them but we will be ready next time. We will outthink them, we will outwork them, we will outpace them. Every time this government fails Tasmanians, we will be there. Every time they break a promise, we will be there. Every time they try to shift the blame, we'll be there, because that's what Labor does when we're at our best. We're there for Tasmanians. We don't protest, we build; we don't tear down, we lift up. We're not a party of grievance. We are the party of the future for Tasmania and for Tasmanians. Today, we draw a line in the sand. The Liberals are tired, inept, they're a marketing department. The protesters can only stop things, never build them. Tasmanians need Labor back at its best. There's no time to waste. We can do this and we're already doing the work.

[2.11 p.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Speaker, this is a budget for Tasmania's prosperity today and for the future, building on the plans that we took to the 2014 election and created a new Tasmania, a prosperous Tasmania where the unemployment rate is still record lows in this country. It balances strong economic and social achievements and the need to respond to the challenges we face and the challenges that all governments face across this nation and indeed the globe as well.

Make no mistake, Tasmania is a state on the rise and it continues to build on the momentum that Tasmanians have created over the course of the last 11 years, backed in just today by the Business Council of Australia when we are second in the nation when it comes to places to invest. Backed in by the National Australia Bank, where we're first when it comes to business confidence in the nation, despite the fact that those opposite for their own selfish grab for power plunged this state into an election. Despite all that uncertainty, there are still many, many people who believe in the future of this state - strong confident and full of opportunity.

Over the past decade, Tasmanians have worked together to build a strong economy and create conditions of growth. This budget underpins a responsible and robust fiscal strategy that delivers targeted strategic investment together with sensible debt management. It delivers responsible budget management through a return to surplus over the forward estimates. 

As laid out in our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future and our government's economic statement, it delivers focused investment on enabling infrastructure, workforce participation and industry support. It contains targeted government efficiency measures to maintain service quality whilst also improving value for taxpayer dollars, and it maintains debt within sustainable limits.

Frankly, as I alluded to before, we should not be here in November debating this budget. It should have been done and dusted back in June, but Tasmania was plunged into limbo by an unworthy and unseemly power grab by those opposite, and it is obvious that they have not learnt and obvious they have not corrected themselves. Indeed, the new Leader of the Opposition promised a new approach. The new Leader of the Opposition said he would consult and correct and promised a new Labor, but it is proving to be an empty promise when a large part of his contribution today was actually talking down Tasmania and Tasmanians and being negative. Same old Labor.

The Labor Party continues to talk Tasmania down and they are defined and forever will be defined - until they can come up with a policy idea - by their relentless negativity and opposition with no vision and no plan. In contrast, on this side of the Chamber, we have a strong plan for this state's future. 

A plan this budget reflects. It aims to deliver an economy where businesses have the conditions, where they can grow and employ more Tasmanians: 51,000 Tasmanians [Bookmark: Phr3_O=28.9_D=1.0_C=0.90]  more, working [Bookmark: Phr4_O=30.5_D=7.5_C=0.84]  for themselves and their families and their communities, than when we came to government in March 2014 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=39.3_D=25.8_C=0.77] , where red tape is removed, approvals are processed in a timely manner, and projects can progress; where trade, industry, tourism and hospitality can thrive; where world-class industry and energy projects deliver regional prosperity.

Yes, we have enormous opportunity when it comes to build on our net zero strengths, our renewable energy, that our forebears [Bookmark: Phr6_O=65.2_D=3.6_C=0.84]  worked so hard to create. We've backed in that [Bookmark: Phr7_O=69.5_D=27.0_C=0.80]  with the tough and courageous decisions when it comes to the Marinus Link, a difficult conversation but a worthy investment, just like hydro industrialisation was a worthy investment. I note the opposition leader's speech just now talking about the renewable energy opportunity, but I remind the honourable member that his team could not make up their mind for two years [Bookmark: Phr8_O=97.4_D=1.8_C=0.56]  whether they supported Marinus Link or not.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Sorry, Premier. I remind members that it is convention in this House that when the leaders are speaking on this that they are given respectful silence. Honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition, you will have your opportunity to make your contribution very soon. I ask that respect is shown, especially today. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, honourable Speaker. Where skills and training are aligned with emerging workforce needs [Bookmark: Phr10_O=126.0_D=3.1_C=0.73]  and infrastructure is developed that unlocks housing, industry and jobs. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=129.5_D=25.8_C=0.86]  A strong and growing economy enables us to deliver the social services and the infrastructure that this state needs and this Budget delivers exactly that. It delivers record investment in health, including over $915 million to meet increased health demand, $70 million more to support elective surgery four-year plan, a plan [Bookmark: Phr12_O=156.2_D=4.8_C=0.82]  designed and will be delivered by the clinicians themselves [Bookmark: Phr13_O=161.6_D=2.6_C=0.91] , which is working, very clearly. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=164.7_D=6.2_C=0.82]  This will enable us to continue to deliver record volumes of elective surgeries, more elective surgeries [Bookmark: Phr15_O=172.2_D=1.2_C=0.90]  than ever before.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=174.0_D=15.6_C=0.88] I commend each and every health professional, nurse, doctor, surgeon within our health system who do work under very difficult conditions with our rising health demand, for what they have achieved, despite the negativity of those opposite. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=190.0_D=14.4_C=0.88]  The Budget contains record investment to keep building a better health system for Tasmanians now and into the future, with over $770 million invested across the forward Estimates, which includes redevelopments at all our major hospitals.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=204.8_D=13.8_C=0.79] Let's not forget, for two elections in a row, Labor had no funding at all for upgrading hospitals and health infrastructure, and while this budget does the heavy lifting in health, it's a task made more difficult [Bookmark: Phr19_O=218.9_D=16.4_C=0.81] , as I said this morning, by a federal government who not only will not take responsibility, but will not back up their commitments to state and territory leaders in December 2023, and that's not just me talking as a Liberal premier [Bookmark: Phr20_O=235.8_D=3.9_C=0.86]  or the Queensland Liberal premier, but every other [Bookmark: Phr21_O=240.7_D=29.4_C=0.80]  premier across this nation. Labor premiers and chief ministers as well, united that the feds need to do more when it comes to reaching into our health system. I'm the first to acknowledge where we have had key partnerships and I've provided an example today where we do acknowledge that contribution, but there is a lot more to be done because there was a commitment by 2035 that they would fund [Bookmark: Phr22_O=270.2_D=8.8_C=0.78]  45 per cent of the health system and it's going backwards now to below 37 per cent if my memory serves me correctly.

 [Bookmark: Phr23_O=280.0_D=25.0_C=0.87] While this budget does the heavy lifting in health, we need the feds to do more. As the Treasurer has said, for too long the federal government has chronically underfunded Tasmania's health system, and as I said this morning, to the tune of $670 million over five years. That's equivalent to being able to treat 1.2 million more people in our emergency department. It is time the federal government paid their fair share. It is time as well, in the spirit of bipartisanship, that we all need to unite, Labor and Liberal, in this place, to call for and advocate for a better federal deal on health. I know you'd be doing it if there was a coalition government, but it doesn't matter what colour the federal government is. We need more support from the federal government. 

When I say 'we', I say Tasmanians. The Tasmanian people need more support. Rather than spending a lot of time speaking about mistruths about the health funding in this budget, I call on those opposite to join the advocacy campaign, like other Labor governments are doing around the nation when it comes to getting our fair share for health. Let them stand up with us but for Tasmanians. 

The cost of living has rightly been front of mind of millions of Australians over the last few years, and particularly for vulnerable Tasmanians as well - all Tasmanians, in actual fact, but particularly vulnerable Tasmanians. Cost pressures have included hikes in groceries, insurance premiums and interest rates, which of course impact on mortgage and rental affordability as well. Our government is providing real action on the cost of living in these areas within our control. This includes offering over 100 different types of concession and discounts for Tasmanians on low incomes. 

This budget also includes significant measures to reduce the cost of living, including halving bus fares for a further year. All fares, all routes, regional and rural, saving Tasmanians thousands of dollars. Delivering, $356 million over for the next four years in concessions assisting those eligible with significant relief with the cost of power bills, local government rates and water and sewerage. For power bills, this year's concessions have increased by 2.13 per cent and the annual relief is about $646. When Hydro makes money, Tasmanians save money, with Hydro dividends in excess of $90 million returned to Tasmanians through the Renewable Energy Dividend Scheme. For water and sewage bills, the Budget provides for a maximum concession of just over $240, an increase of two per cent of the last year. For local government rates, it means assistance of up to $385 per annum for TasWater customers or up $566 for non-TasWater customers.

In the budget, we're also delivering our Healthy School Breakfast program, expanding and extending the school lunch program, including kitchen upgrades. Providing for the Energy Hardship Fund that directly supports Tasmanians with their energy bills through the Salvation Army, providing significant funding for food relief and resilience, continuing the Neighbourhood House Community Connector program as we promised at the 2024 state election, and delivering ongoing support for our multicultural communities, older Tasmanians, carers, veterans and community appeals. 

It also secures funding for Hamlet and Troublesmiths - who I had the pleasure of being with the other day - and extends funding for the Tasmanian Bike Collective and Dress for Success, all helping to break down the barriers for seeking employment. It continues funding for the Area Connect program that provides transport in regional and rural areas to connect Tasmanians to jobs and training. In other words, this is a government with heart. This is a government, despite our challenges - and we've invested in enabling infrastructure - we've invested in areas of the economy so we can grow the economy to support more Tasmanians in need. We will never let Tasmanians down or never let a single Tasmanian be left behind, because we care about Tasmanian people. We care about the fact that investment in those concessions, supporting vulnerable Tasmanians, are so critically important because every single Tasmanian deserves to have equal opportunity in this state.

We always talk up this state and so should we; look at where we are. Look at our environment, look at the skills of our employees, our businesses and the advanced manufacturing, the tourism industry - as the honourable member the Opposition Leader said before - and I agree. The enormous opportunity we have and we celebrate that, and so we should celebrate that, but we should never leave a single Tasmanian behind and that's why we make the decisions we do, with sensible fiscal responsibility and budget measures - not ripping the heart out of the budget like in 2011, where constricted the economy and we lost 10,000 jobs in the process over those four years, if my memory serves me correctly - but sensible budget management, where we do have a surplus in the forward Estimates, albeit, yes, a small one, but a surplus nonetheless. 

I know the Treasurer, who is doing a fantastic job, and all of us, as Cabinet ministers, will take collective responsibility to ensure that is delivered. We're a government that grows the economy, supports more investment, supports people into work, trains people into work to ensure that they can contribute to their economy, but also ensuring that we are working hard to never let vulnerable Tasmanians down.

That's why we support the organisations that support vulnerable Tasmanians. I know full well that organisations such as TasCOSS will quite rightly always stand up for vulnerable Tasmanians and their organisations, and so they should, which is why in 2024 we committed to growth funding for community organisations so they could plan better for their workforce and plan better so they can as community organisations support Tasmanians in need.  

There will always be more to do, and I accept organisations such as TasCOSS will always continue to advocate for that, but the Budget clearly demonstrates that this is a budget that, yes, has fiscal responsibility, a surplus in the forward Estimates, but does not let vulnerable Tasmanians down.

It continues the funding for the Area Connect program that provides transport in regional and rural areas to connect Tasmanians to jobs and training. In other words, breaking down all those barriers so that people can participate not only in education but also the workforce and the community, as well and stamping out stamp duty policy continues and this has already assisted over 6000 Tasmanians into their own home. We are legislating our $30,000 first-home builder grants, making it easier for young people and families to get a foot up on the property ladder, and that's three times the current grant rate. We want Tasmanians to aspire to have and own their own slice of Tasmania, the great Australian dream, and we must never lose sight of how important it is to ensure that aspiration always continues so people know when they go into training, when they know they are going to get a job, that they have that opportunity, at some point in their life, to own their own slice of Tasmania, their own home for their families and themselves.

I recognise that that's not possible for many, many people, which is why we must continue to invest in social and affordable housing and put roofs over the heads of Tasmanians to ensure that they are safe, and I recognise how important it is to continue to deliver those 10,000 social and affordable homes, and this budget also includes funding for five new units at the Hobart Women's Shelter. So important.

The Budget provides more housing support for women facing homelessness at the former Bethlehem House. We have also reduced home deposits by 2 per cent under the MyHome program, helping hundreds of householders into their own home. We have already delivered our $100 Eat Local, Stay Local vouchers, helping Tasmanians get out and enjoy Tasmania's wonderful hospitality and tourism offerings. When I was in Strahan recently, I was pleased to meet a table full of people that, indeed, took that opportunity up, and we continue to deliver thousands more bulk-billed doctor appointments through our mobile GP clinic.

When they sit there and whinge that the feds should be doing more, which they should - I have said we do not just do that - we also reach into their responsibility and fund those essential primary healthcare services, such as those bulk-billed doctor appointments. That's right - we're also assisting older Tasmanians with two $100 vouchers to stay active through our Ticket to Wellbeing program. The Budget also continues delivery of our promised 12.5 per cent indexation, as I mentioned before, for community sector organisations over four years, and, through increased investment, we're helping more low-income Tasmanians from all areas of the state get access to no-interest loans for household essentials.

We've delivered support to thousands of Tasmanians with emergency relief grants after severe weather events and also through drought and bushfires. We will always step in when we need to. Our government has and will continue to deliver real practical action on the cost of living, and it's backed by real funding and commitment to Tasmanians doing it tough as well.

Our government's priority is to safeguard children and young people to support them, their families and caregivers. We have committed to implementing the 191 recommendations of the commission of inquiry, as well as significant ongoing funding for implementation across relevant agencies and, in line with the commission of inquiry, there is also funding for the operations of the implementation monitor, provision for claims related to child sexual abuse in state care, and funding for implementation of the Weiss review. The whole-of-government budget to deliver commission of inquiry reforms has increased from $424 million over the forward Estimates to $600 million. As I said this morning, in addition, we have set aside a further $600 million to compensate victim-survivors of child sexual abuse in our institutions.

Across government, the budget also includes funding for the Bringing Baby Home program designed to support vulnerable parents and babies remain together at home. There's funding for the new Child and Family Learning Centres as well as outreach funding to engage more young children in rural and regional areas. There are capital upgrades for our out-of-school care at priming and district schools. A one-year uplift for foster and kinship carer supports payments to reflect the reform work underway. Continued funding for the Intensive Family Engagement Service for families with complex issues that impact on the safety of children and young people.

Additional funding for children and young people in out-of-home care and the Transition to Independence program to support young people in care beyond the age of 18. Significant funding for the new Tasmanian youth justice facility and funding for the new Commission for Children and Young People.

There is also funding more broadly for Camp Clayton and Glenhaven Family Care, supporting children and families in Sheffield and Ulverstone, and funding for the development of a youth participation framework. Significant funding is also provided for specialised therapeutic support services for victim/survivors of sexual abuse and violence, both children and young people and adults. There is also additional funding for child and youth mental health, delivering our healthy school breakfast program, our school lunch program.

The Budget demonstrates our government's continued strong commitment to education with a record investment for the Education portfolio of more than $2 billion in this financial year alone and $8.9 billion across the four years.

I acknowledge the honourable members passion for education - and why wouldn't it be there, as a former teacher within the education system? - and we need to ensure that we continue to invest and ensuring that all children, irrespective of circumstance or background, have access to quality education. Because we do know that the more young people can be supported in our education system, the more productive and healthier lives they will have, which is why we've had reforms over the last 10 years.

It means working together for vulnerable three-year-olds; our extension to years 11 and 12 offerings across our high schools; the continued growth in funding and education of two bilateral agreements, one in 2017, which did focus particularly on investing in trauma informed practice and indeed supporting students with disability.

Other growth funding more recently signed by minister Palmer continues that growth trajectory where we could actually benefit from that right now with an uplift in funding to support our Tasmanian children. Our government understands the role that built environment has in supporting high-quality teaching and learning and student engagement, and through this budget we're investing over $294 million over the next four years for education facilities. I have seen and visited schools that have had massive improvements over the last decade, when it comes to the built infrastructure and a learning environment more conducive to engaging young people in school.

The new Brighton High School is fantastic and I commend all those involved with the Brighton High School, but to see a room there dedicated to young Tasmanians with severe disability and enabling them through that infrastructure to engage in school and education is extraordinary. To similarly see that at, of course, the new Legana Primary School as well, but other upgrades over the many years, over the last 11 years, in all areas of Tasmania.

We are continuing to grow our investment, making sure our children have the best start in life by lifting literacy skills. It is clear, lifting literacy strategy is working, and through this budget, we are backing our schools to continue on this transformative journey by providing $12 million in the 2025 school year to supercharge literacy resources. I commend our education minister's ongoing commitment to our school children and parents, our teachers and our support staff as well in taking on the challenge of that education portfolio and for the time and dedication in visiting as many schools as possible, listening and, most importantly, learning what our school leaders and our principals need, what our teachers need, and creating an environment where there is an uplift in funding in education and to ensure that our young people get the best possible opportunity.

I mentioned students with disability; $287 million in this financial year as we continue to support Tasmanians living with disability. This investment delivers a range of supports including funding specialist disability support services provided by the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Along with growing our economy, we recognise the need to ensure Tasmanian taxpayers' funds are being spent wisely and that departments are looking at ways to deliver services to the community as efficiently as possible. All Tasmanians would expect that.

We are continuing to focus on reshaping public service delivery, enhancing fiscal transparency and embedding structural changes that support a more efficient public sector. The newly created Efficiency and Productivity Unit, supported by independent analysis, will assist in delivering the efficiency improvements that we need. I can, today, update the House on progress with the online portal launched just this week to give state servants the opportunity to share their ideas of making the service more efficient and effective.

In the first four days, the survey attracted 258 new ideas from 153 public servants from across the service - great engagement. The highest number of ideas came from our frontline workers such as police, teachers, doctors and nurses and we welcome those contributions, listening and learning so we can act. I commend this input and we look forward to continuing to work shoulder-to-shoulder with the State Service in this important endeavour.

As I have noted, this budget will continue our commitment to grow the economy. Since we came to govern, almost 50,000 more Tasmanians have been employed, up almost 20 per cent. Our unemployment rate has gone from 7.4 per cent to 4 per cent, still the highest in the nation - lowest in the nation, sorry, I was going back to Labor's time. Never has it been so low. Annual wage growth has gone from the lowest in the nation to the highest as well, and gross state product is up over 26 per cent, with almost $8.5 billion new value added. These are outstanding outcomes delivered, of course, in partnership with the Tasmanian community. Partnership. Policy settings of government and, together, Tasmanians invest and care for their fellow Tasmanians and I have mentioned the Business Council of Australia released its latest report, which points to all good things for Tasmania, but we must continue that momentum. We're number 2; we need to work on being number 1, and we will. That's our focus, that's our determination. It's about looking into the future. It's about building a better Tasmania and continuing to deliver for Tasmania. 

I acknowledge the Treasurer and the Treasurer's team for their fantastic work in a very short timeframe for the interim budget. I will just say this: I have worked with minister Abetz for many decades now, and known him for almost 35 years, or probably even longer. I thank you for your contribution to public life, and I thank you for all the work that you are doing and the work you've done across some really challenging areas, particularly Treasury. I commend your interim Budget and we will work solidly on the May budget next year, Treasurer Abetz, to again deliver for Tasmanians. 

It might be an interim Budget, but it paves the way, as the Treasurer has said, to keep our finances strong so we can ensure a strong future for our great state.

I commend the bill to the House. 

[2.41 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to give my contribution to this interim Budget following the 'It's not my fault' speech from the Premier, Jeremy Rockliff, today. He spent a lot of time talking about the Australian federal government, which he said is responsible for this lack of health funding, and 10 minutes later he said, 'But we shouldn't whinge' about the thing that he spent the first 10 minutes whingeing about. 

We're in this budget mess because of the of the Rockliff Liberal government's inability to make the right decisions and make tough decisions, and their continued determination to kick every tough decision down the road. That's what we've seen over the last few years. That's why we've seen massive deficits. They're the sort of deficits that no one would have ever believed Tasmania would have seen only 10 years ago, but yet, they're deficits that now seem normal.

Mr Shelton - You voted for them. Labor voted for the past budgets. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Interjections will cease. 

Mr WINTER - Honourable Speaker, I welcome the interjection. The member for Lyons said only a few weeks ago that it was our fault that the government decided to shut down the greyhound racing industry. Today, he's just blamed us for voting for Liberal budgets. Is the member for Lyons now saying that no-one should support supply in this House? I certainly hope not. These are the sorts of interjections we get from the member for Lyons every now and then because he's stuck in a little box here. Like so many other members of this government, he's stuck in a government that he doesn't support the policies of. 

One of the great greyhound speeches given in this place was given by Mr Shelton only last year. He spoke so passionately about his passion for greyhounds, about how if you shut down greyhound racing you would actually end the breed. I thought, 'There's someone who's passionate about racing. There's someone who's always going to stand up for this industry'. Right in front of him is Mr Ellis, a man who said that racing was a part of Tasmanian way of life. A man who stood with greyhounds - I have the name of it here actually, Paul Young and Speak Now. Do you remember Speak Now, Mr Ellis?

Mr Ellis - I certainly do.

Mr WINTER - It's the name of a greyhound that Mr Ellis had befriended, and Mr Young, who is a great racing person. He built a real friendship and affinity with that group before he joined with Jeremy Rockliff, and of course Mr Shelton, to shut the industry down.

These are people who only 12 months ago said they had the backs of these people, and now they're preparing to sell them out. That's what this government does now: it sells people out. Tasmanians know that if you get a letter from Jeremy Rockliff, it's worth absolutely nothing. He sold out to the Greens and the green Independents to save his job. They know his word means nothing. If they get that letter, they know they need to watch out; not just for Mr Rockliff, but for minister Howlett, minister Ellis and Mr Shelton, who are now after the greyhound racing industry who backed them and trusted them, who now can't trust a word they say. 

I put it to the House: what would Mr Ellis have said if Labor entered government with the Greens, shut down greyhound racing and took up 80 per cent of Peter George's salmon policy? Just think for a second about what he would have said. He would be completely off the show. He would be apoplectic about it. He wouldn't be able to contain his enthusiasm for the argument and the fight. He sits there now muted and unable to speak about the things he used to speak for and the people he used to speak for. That dog was called Speak Now. It's not just the name of the dog. It's something that members of the Liberal Party should think about as this Premier prepares to railroad and destroy the livelihoods of people that thought you had their back. It's shameful what has happened.

It was minister Howlett who said that she wouldn't shut greyhound racing down. Of course, the Premier is the man who wrote to Ben Englund of the local greyhound racing club and said that he had their backs. He said:

The Government is committed to supporting the longevity and sustainability of the racing industry which, as you know, generates $208 million in economic activity in Tasmania which involves more than 6,400 people. [tbc]

That is 6400 people potentially impacted by this decision. This shameful decision that prepares to take people's jobs. This is a government that wants to talk about business confidence, but of course this is a business community that has lost confidence in this government. The Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) expressed its deep concern about the Liberal government's salmon announcement. Michael Bailey said:

Business and industry requires policy certainty in order to invest and create jobs. We just had an election where both major parties expressed strong support for the salmon industry, which resulted in a parliament where over two thirds of the elected members nominally support that sector. Yet now, as a result of post-election political machinations, we have a completely different policy announcement which turns that upside down. Today’s decision sends the message that Tasmania is not a safe place to do business. [tbc]

This follows on from only 12 months earlier where the same business lobby said it would be hard to ever trust this government again. That's where we are.

I remind again the Premier that in his contribution about his standing up for Tasmania no matter what government is in Canberra. I still remember, and it wasn't that long ago, back in 2018, when the GST deal was going down, and we had the prime minister, Mr Turnbull, and the treasurer, Mr Morrison, who were out for blood - blood of Tasmanian taxpayers in a GST deal that would severely, detrimentally, and in the long term, be a huge loss for our state and for our budget with the GST deal.

Horizontal fiscal equalisation suddenly became a term that Tasmanians became familiar with because we were frightened of what the changes would mean for our state. Initially, the then-deputy premier, Mr Rockliff, then-treasurer, Mr Gutwein, and then-premier, Mr Hodgman, held the line and defended Tasmania's interests. Until all of a sudden, they sold Tasmania out and gave the political ammunition that the federal government needed to sell Tasmania out. We've ended up now in a budget that is perilous because of the continual reliance on the no-worse-off guarantee that we need to continue to have extended because we voluntarily and inexplicably agreed to the new scheme.

It is shameful and it's an example of where this government hasn't stood up to Canberra. On this side of the Chamber, we have shown that we are prepared to stand up to the Australian government. It was only last year, we spent so much of our political time and capital battling to preserve the jobs of those workers at Macquarie Harbour. As I said then, I don't care who's in Canberra. I don't care who the Prime Minister is or what colour their political side is - we are going to stand with workers, and we have continued to do that and we will continue to do that. It does not matter to us who's in Canberra. We will work with people that want to work with us, as we have with Prime Minister Albanese who is doing an incredible job. When we need to, of course, we will stand up. We've got that record and the Liberals unfortunately do not.

This is a budget which is severely challenged by growing expenditure and a government that is now choosing to believe that it can keep expenditure increases at record low levels over a long period of time, at the same time claiming that we are not going to lose any services.

This is not a magic pudding, but that's what they are proposing. This is this is a budget which is more challenged than any other state in Australia and has become challenged not over the course of the last 20 years, and not even over the course of the last 11 years. Only over the last few years post-COVID, where we've seen this explosion of spending and a government that hasn't been prepared to make any tough decisions. 

If you have a mine that needs to be bailed out, they will bail it out. If you have any requirement, any funding that's needed, this is a government that will find it to solve political problems. This is a government that's overseeing government businesses that are now costing our Tasmanian budget huge sums of money, likely in the billions of dollars now just for TT-Line. The Auditor-General's report that we saw yesterday outlines the severe challenges that now face our state and our non-financial public sector area which, as I said, is severely challenged. 

The debt-to-equity ratio on companies like TT-Line and TasNetworks is not sustainable and hasn't been for quite some time. Not just unsustainable: we're now standing here debating a budget when we know that TT-Line, a government business, worth billions of dollars is, according to the Auditor-General of Tasmania, insolvent. TT-Line, according to the report that came out yesterday, on the date of the audit in August was insolvent, and since that time there's been an additional expansion of the loan facility of another $400 million. There's a promise in this budget of an extra $75 million in equity injection, but anyone who can read this thing knows that's not going to be enough.

We suspect the government has a figure in mind. We suspect the figure will probably come out in May's budget. It is yet another example of a black hole within this budget, a black hole that's been caused by complete ineptitude. Yes - and I note that the report was tabled by Mr Jaensch earlier today - people can read it for themselves. Yes, huge ineptitude on the board in management of TT-Line. The same can be said and should be said for TasPorts and their failure to work together. Though more importantly than anything, the lack of oversight by the then treasurer of Tasmania, the member for Bass, and by the Premier who didn't seem to know anything about it. 

Yet again here today, the really critical issues, huge issues. It's not just about the berth, it's not just about the ships, it's also about the finances that actually allow them to operate. The embarrassment now for the state is that, not only could we not build a berth for our new ships, but the company also that's running them is probably insolvent. It was just sort of flicked away by the Premier this morning. You know, 'That's his opinion, that's his opinion'. Well, it's actually more than an opinion; it's a legal requirement. It's actually really important.

When it comes to the statistics around this budget itself, we have some pretty significant concerns. They're concerns that are within this budget, but of course they're not concerns that are new. These are concerns which are long-standing that haven't been raised just by Labor or by the crossbench or by Saul Eslake or by any other commentary, by S&P or Moody's. They've actually been raised by Treasury in a publicly available document; it's a wonderful read and members on the other side might like to read it one day. It's called the Tasmanian Government Fiscal Sustainability Report 2021, the next one's due next year. There's a fair bit to it. I can't read it all into Hansard, but perhaps go back, just acquaint yourself with the advice that you were given years ago on page 7 on the Executive Summary if I'm not mistaken. I've read this so many times I can almost recite it - 

The size of the corrective action required to maintain fiscal sustainability increases over the projection period. [tbc]

What that means is, if you don't do anything about it now - that's four years ago - this is going to get much worse. In receipt of that advice, from Treasury to the government, then tabled in the House - we talked about it - they did nothing, just did nothing at all, just let it get worse. Here we are today with a Treasurer that has a plan to cut 2800 Tasmanian public sector workers. The reason, because the size of the corrective action is now at such a point that massive changes need to be made, and the longer this goes, the worse the situation. It's the workers and the people that rely on their services that I feel most sorry for because every dollar of interest that's now being paid on this massive and growing debt is caused by the decisions of this Tasmanian Liberal government.

Saul Eslake, in one of his many reports into this, points out that every single one of these issues goes down to policy decisions made by the government. No-one else is to blame for this. It's you. You did the whole thing. You have been in government for 11 years and pointing to the former Labor government - I think you might have given up on that now, it's been 11 years. Now, it's about looking for someone else to blame. That's what the Premier's speech was this morning - This is the start of the next campaign, who can I blame?

He is going after Canberra now, and blaming them for 11 years of government, for massive debt and interest. That means that instead of paying for schools and hospitals, for nurses, for teachers, for people that are so important for our community, we're spending it on interest. That's this Liberal government.

Mr Jaensch - Are you sticking up for Canberra?

Mr WINTER - As I said earlier, Mr Jaensch, we stand up for Tasmania to Canberra no matter what colour is there and we have done that repeatedly and consistently. On the GST issue - where you went missing - it was Rebecca White, as leader of the opposition, who was the last one standing to say this is a bad deal for Tasmania. Even when federal Labor was voting for it, she stood here and said it was a bad deal for Tasmania. I remember it. I think Bill Shorten was opposition leader at the time, and it was the Liberals who sold Tasmania out and agreed with the deal. 

Last year on Macquarie Harbour. We will always stand up for Tasmania's best interest and I am very proud that we do.

To sum up my contribution today -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The only person who should be speaking right now is the member for Franklin.

Mr WINTER - Tasmania has the most extraordinary opportunities in front of it. When I go around and see the level of investment that wants to come to Tasmania in renewable energy, for example, it is absolutely extraordinary. All the private sector is looking for is some certainty and some confidence - and some competence - that their investments can happen, but they don't have that. They don't have that because we have a Premier that writes letters and says one thing and then goes and does the exact opposite.

They don't have confidence in the competence, for example, because of the hydrogen action plan. Where we had four of the largest companies in Australia here trying to invest but couldn't and there's a big impact on those things, Mr Jaensch. There's a big impact on that because of the lack of business confidence, but also the lack of flow through into our economy, the lack of renewable energy generation coming into the grid from projects like Robbins Island, which was held up for seven years within Tasmania's planning system.

The problems we're dealing with TasNetworks, a government business that doesn't seem to be able to deal with the private sector to make projects a reality. These are serious and big challenges that hurt our economy. If we are going to have a strong economy and a strong budget, business and workers need to have confidence that this government is going to do what it says and, at the moment, they don't because how could they?

You have a Premier that writes a letter to the salmon industry and says we will not trade you away during any negotiations and then, with Mr George - and credit to you, you got exactly what you wanted - did exactly what he said he wouldn't. He goes to the greyhound racing industry and says we have your back, then, in an appeal to Ms Johnston and the Greens, does the exact opposite.

This is a shameful attack on people working in the aquaculture industry and people working in racing, and it goes to a lack of confidence and certainty to invest. The opportunities are there, but the competence in government is not. We need to see significant changes in the way that these issues are dealt with.

The budget itself is an interim budget not just in name, but in substance. It is not a budget that deals with any of the large issues: The debt still doubles, the issues are still there, and they are still pretending they can reduce expenditure growth year by year and not cut any services. If you talk to public sector workers, they will tell you that is not true.

In my role as shadow treasurer, I look forward to working with public sector workers and the unions that represent them - because that's what unions are, they represent the workers, that's how it works - to try to find a way through this. As challenging as the situation is, as much as the Budget is a complete mess, as much as business confidence has been destroyed by the deals the Premier struck, we have to try to make Tasmania better.

The opportunities are there. They are there in renewable energy, in tourism, freight, mining, and advanced manufacturing. They are there right across my electorate. They are there in building and construction as well if we can get through the planning issues that are in plague proportions. They are there, but we need the government to do better.

Our job in this term is to be a strong opposition that holds the government to account. Things like our GBEs, the budget, service provision, that's so important. That's what we're going to do, and I look forward to doing it.

[3.00 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I am very pleased to stand here today in support of the budget. I pass on my sincere congratulations to the new Treasurer, Eric Abetz, and acknowledge the hard work of him and his team.

First, I acknowledge that today is Remembrance Day, a very special day for our community. People are commemorating the more than 100,000 lives lost across our great country in the First World War, of course, some 15,000 Tasmanians served and an estimated 3000 made the ultimate sacrifice. I acknowledge that. It was an honour to be the minister for Veterans' Affairs over many years, but I acknowledge upfront Gavin Pearce, who's our newish Minister for Veterans' Affairs, served this nation for more than two decades, including in East Timor, and gave so much of his life to his nation. He served well and is now continuing to serve in public service in this parliament. Thank you, Gavin Pearce, for your service.

I acknowledge the presence earlier today in the Chamber of Garry Ivory and his brother, Kevin. Garry fought for 32 years to achieve a Victoria Cross for his uncle, Teddy Sheean. It was great to be with Garry, Kevin and Rob Fairs, a member for Bass, at a small presentation of a replica of Teddy Sheean's VC and other medals at MACq 01 Hotel earlier today to honour the memory of Teddy Sheean.

Turning to the Budget, it seems that the cat has been belled in terms of - is it Wooden Willy and Robust Rocky? The passion of our Premier in responding to the opposition leader's response today is palpable. You can see that he's a Premier of integrity and ambition, and someone who really cares for his community and he's stood up and outlined the vision in this budget for our great state of Tasmania.

Not one alternative measure to provide for budget repair from the opposition leader or the shadow treasurer. Not one measure put forward to improve the budget. We've heard from the opposition leader and the shadow treasurer. Not one. Relentless negativity, it goes on and on, and it seems they have not heard the message from the election nor from the public since then. This continuous, relentless negativity goes on and on. Yet today, what have we heard? The National Australia Bank's business survey put Tasmania at the top of the list when it comes to business confidence in all Australia. This is on the back of an election that we were forced to have thanks to Labor and the Greens and those opposite, that Tasmanians didn't want. Yet, business confidence is still that high, across the nation, when you compare Tassie's business confidence to the rest of the nation. 

On top of that, there's the Business Council of Australia and their regulation rumble - their annual report. What does the annual report say? It says very positive news for Tasmania, and it backs us in as having the second-best business conditions in the nation. As the minister for Small Business, who's had decades of advocacy for small business, it's such an honour to be in this role; but to be able to reflect on that, it is absolutely brilliant. 

What did the Business Council of Australia say in terms of their annual scorecard assessing regulations such as payroll tax, business licencing, red tape, stamp duty, planning approval schemes and workers compensation schemes? The BTA chief executive, Bran Black, said Tasmania was: 

Punching above its weight compared to many of the biggest states when it came to cutting red tape and streamlining planning systems. Tassie's success lies in its focus on efficiency and certainty for businesses. 

He said 

Clear time frames for approvals and a nearly complete statewide planning scheme give business confidence and speed up decision-making. [tbc]

Tasmania came in first for planning certainty, with legislated timeframes for decision-making across the planning system. It came second for competitive land tax and stamp duty rates and efficient development application processes. That is good news. Let's welcome it, let's acknowledge it, put it on the record. Thank you for that annual update. Of course, there's more work to do. We have a clear vision as a government to cut the red tape, streamline the process, and make it easier for business to do business, to employ more people.

You see so many of those small businesses - and there's more than 42,000 of them in Tasmania - employing more than 100,000 Tasmanians. This is backing in the private sector. That's what we're doing as a government, and there is more work to do. Part of our election manifesto outlined a whole range of red-tape reduction measures, and the Premier outlined some of those in his budget contribution just a few moments ago.

The proof of the pudding is in the eating, with the 51,000 extra jobs since we came to government in 2014. That's positive. It's a net positive. It's a $40.5 billion economy now. It's 26 per cent bigger than when we came to government in 2014. We are now sitting at the lowest, or record low, unemployment rates in history in Tasmania. This is encouraging news. We're not saying it's all hunky dory for everyone across the state; that's not the case. I accept that. I get feedback as minister for Small Business accordingly, but I get feedback on the positives as well as the negatives.

I wanted to do a bit of a shout out to Fiona Turner and her team at Bitwise Agronomy. As minister for Trade, I was there with the Premier just in September a few months ago, and they'd benefited from the accelerating trade grant of up to $10,000. This particular grant provides - across all of those grants - $500,000 in the last 12 months, delivering a $34 million return in terms of exports. That's a really pretty good return on funds invested for and on behalf of the taxpayer. As minister for Trade, with an ambition to get to $15 billion in exports by 2050, that's our ambition, and we're heading that way. 

Fiona and her family and her team, Bitwise Agronomy, this is a small business employing ten people just outside of Launceston, taking advantage of our trade policies and initiatives. It's taking Tasmanian technology to the world, it's absolutely brilliant, using artificial intelligence, and I know the minister responsible is excited about that. It's looking at harvest predictions and benefiting not just those in Tasmania and Australia, but across the globe, and it's Tasmanian ingenuity, AI, all coming together as a result of their efforts, with $1 million recently secured in terms of capital raisings. Congratulations. It's a small business that's in the trade space that's exporting. Of course, when it comes to our exports, that's very exciting news, with now more than $6 billion in our exports, a 5 per cent increase. That's much higher than the average across the nation. Of course, it goes up and down a little bit, but we are aiming for $15 billion by 2050.

This is very encouraging news for Tasmania. In short, let me make it very clear what our plan is as a government, and that is to grow the economy so that we can use the funds that come through back to government to reinvest into our essential services. For example, health, education, housing, police and community safety. You need a growing economy to reinvest into those essential services. Guess what? That's exactly what we're doing. I would like to pay a tribute to the new minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing, Bridget Archer, who's doing incredible job in just a few months in the role and delivering. In fact, it's delivering $10 million a day as is set out in the Budget papers. That's the biggest part of our budget, some 34 per cent. An absolutely brilliant job and it's growing. Let's be very clear, it's in the Budget papers and it's growing. 

On the back of that, I want to pay a tribute, likewise, to the Minister for Education, the Minister for Children and Youth and the Minister for Disability Services, Jo Palmer, who is doing incredible job in that space. That's one of our essential services. Every week, she is in and out of our schools learning, listening and contributing to those students and families and supporting our teachers and those in our education sector. I'm very pleased to stand with them on those particular matters.

In terms of those essential services, in terms of new police on the beat, this is happening under our government. In terms of justice and legal reforms that we're contributing to in our budget, and I've made it clear it's an interim Budget and we will have more to say in May next year, but we have some fantastic reforms in terms of justice. Over the last two years since I've been an Attorney-General and Minister for Justice and now more recently Corrections and Rehabilitation, I'm honoured to be in that role, but we have a very substantial body of reforms in terms of the commission of inquiry and implementing all 191 recommendations.

More recently, establishing plans to establish the new Commission for Children and Young People. We debated that just very recently, and thank you to those in this Chamber for that terrific support. I want to say thank you to the Implementation Monitor, Robert Benjamin, for his role, recently appointed, playing a very important role. I pass on congratulations to Robert Hay KC, the new Chief Commissioner of the Integrity Commission that I announced earlier today, in that role, a very important role. 

Of course, in terms of keeping the community safe, I've mentioned earlier in the Chamber today, Daniel's Law. Thank you to the Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Management for helping keep our community safe. I've introduced, more recently, the counterterrorism powers and legislation that we've locked in and I hope can progress positively through the parliament again to keep our community safe. 

One of the best reforms, of course, in the last decade in the justice space is the establishment of Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (TASCAT). That is like a one-stop shop. It's cutting the red tape, streamlining the process, and helping business and community members and individuals and families to have their concerns heard and resolved. I thank TASCAT for the work they do. It was great being at the opening of the new TASCAT facilities in Launceston just in the last couple of weeks.

In terms of Legal Aid, contrary to the views that were put wrongly by the Leader for the Greens earlier this morning, Legal Aid funding has increased $4 million over the next two years. I'm pleased and proud of that. It is so important to support those who are vulnerable, those in need. Our Legal Aid funding and support is there in the Budget. All those reforms strengthen our justice system, improve community safety, and ensures fairer access to the law for all Tasmanians.

In terms of Corrections and Rehabilitation, we're delivering. There's more to do and we'll have more to say about that.

Before I conclude, with respect to the small business sector, I pay a tribute to Geoff Fader from the Tasmanian Small Business Council. He was recently given life membership to the Small Business Council, and I was likewise honoured to receive that life membership just some few weeks ago, but his advocacy for small business is so important for Tasmania and I thank him for it.

It's consistent with the small business growth strategy through to 2026 and I thank the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Tasmanian Small Business Council, for their feedback to me, to my office, to the government with respect of how we can grow our economy and make it easier and better for business.

Reducing the cost of doing business, the cost of living wherever possible, and we should mention the renewable energy dividend and all because if Hydro does well, Tasmanians will do well and save money. Our renewable energy credentials in Tasmania are bar none across the country, indeed across the globe, with 100 percent fully self-sufficient in renewable energy. We have worked so hard to progress Marinus Link and, yes, the funding is in the Budget, contrary to Labor being so equivocal for a couple of years. Now they do support it, which is greatly appreciated, but we worked so hard despite the constant criticism to get that project up and going and I'm really pleased and proud of the funding support in our Budget for that - the North West Transmission - and this will deliver benefits in fact more than $400 million to return to Tasmania on average from 2031 from the start of Marinus Link going forward. I just wanted to put that on the record. 

I thank Nick Duigan, Minister for Energy and Renewables, for his terrific leadership in that regard. I wanted to also indicate in terms of wrapping up that the Ethnic Business Awards was an excellent awards on the weekend to acknowledge the multicultural businesses across Tasmania and across our country. 

The minister for Multicultural Affairs, Madeleine Ogilvie, Eric Abetz, I and many others were there to celebrate that wonderful award evening. Joseph Assaf, who has for 36 years led that awards event, congratulations to you.

Before I wrap up, in terms of cutting red tape and the business community, I was at the building ministers meeting just a couple of weeks ago and made the call for and on behalf of the Tasmanian government: 'No more red tape.' We have led the nation in that regard. There's now a nation-first six-year freeze on new National Construction Code 2025 requirements. I'm very glad to have the support of the industry groups, the Housing Industry Association, the Property Council of Tasmania, Master Builders Tasmania. Thank you for your support for that. This is an election commitment we have delivered on and will continue to do so. I'll have more to say about how we can deliver further on keeping costs down for business, and we're getting on with the job.

In conclusion, it's also an honour to be the member for Lyons and to stand up for those rural and regional communities across Tasmania of course littered with small businesses, because we're a small business state and they are the lifeblood of those rural and regional communities, standing up for the productive industries that need that support, obviously agriculture, forestry, mining, aquaculture and the like.

To put a plug in for our water infrastructure projects, the Greater South East Irrigation project, we've led that charge when I was minister for primary industries and water. We secured $5 million for the review assessment feasibility and, guess what, now we have the commitment from the federal government. That is so good. That's a $300 million investment in the Greater South East. It will be our biggest water irrigation scheme in Tasmanian history. It will deliver benefits not just to the rural and regional communities but our economy as a whole. I'm so excited about that irrigation project and our history as a state in terms of accessing federal funds, state funds for our rural and regional communities.

Water is liquid gold. We're backing it in and making that contribution again - that is in the Budget. In summary, our Budget is an interim budget. The Treasurer has made that very clear. It is one that will deliver sustainability and focus on productivity and efficiency, getting a return on funds invested. There's more work to do and we'll see that in the May budget next year. Congratulations to Eric Abetz, the Treasurer,  the Premier, all of my colleagues on this side of the House, and I do commend the Budget to all members and call for the support of the Budget as it is before us. I thank the House.

[3.20 p.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Deputy Speaker, I rise this afternoon to give my contribution on the Budget before the House. In doing so, I want to create some commentary and some truthfulness in the way this government represents the financials of Tasmania and the way this government represents the Budget that it is putting forward before Tasmanians. I also want to share some stories about what it really means when it is not honest about the circumstances in Tasmania. What it really means to Tasmanians - to individuals, to families, to communities - when it does not speak the truth, that it raises expectations and then pulls the rug out from under hard-working, valuable members of our Tasmanian community.

I start with a bit of a picture about a small town in the northeast of Tasmania, an incredible town of somewhere between 200 and 300 people: the town of Branxholm. The town of Branxholm is an incredible indication of things that are possible in Tasmania. The town and its businesses and its community deliver incredibly to the local families, to individuals. They gather at the pub, they have a great time together. I've been many nights at the local pub where there's been local birthday celebrations or local community celebrations. Also, within this little town, we have businesses that construct and deliver unique items right across the country. We have businesses in this tiny little town that are regarded across the country for the work that they do in this community. We have a great mill that does really important work for the state of Tasmania. The truthfulness of this Budget, the pressure of the decisions that this government makes, the tightness that it creates within different departments and different government businesses across Tasmania impact towns like Branxholm. They impact communities that live there.

I want to use the example of where this government is not upfront and honest with Tasmanian people through, for instance, one of my portfolio areas - the energy portfolio - and the way that they use that to assert with our government business enterprises negotiations in, say, power deals at Bell Bay Aluminium, at the other end of the scale, a large commercial organisation employing a large number of Tasmanians, supporting a large number of businesses across Tasmania that actually rely on a great little business in Branxholm, the Branxholm Sawmill.

If this government is not honest and upfront about the pressures that it has in the Tasmanian finances in its budget, if it does not call to account its government business enterprises to act in accordance with its ministerial charters, then the impacts of those decisions that look like big politics actually have real and tangible material impacts in the lives of Tasmanians living in the northeast of Tasmania. The Branxholm Sawmill has a very diverse range of offerings, one of which is significant - the things that it constructs specifically and uniquely for Bell Bay Aluminium, which is a significant part of its business. In the event that Bell Bay Aluminium, by the next 12 months, is unable to secure its power deal, then businesses like Branxholm Sawmill will have a critical impact on that local community. It will mean less jobs for locals. It will mean less jobs for apprentices. It will mean less jobs for people that live in and around that community. It will mean pressure on the local pub. It will mean pressure in the other businesses that rely on having that workforce available. It will mean pressure on the local schools. 

When this government doesn't stand up and is not honest about the things that impact Tasmanians, it hurts our community, and that really upsets me. What actually drives me in this place is the way that we can work together across a parliament to support individuals and families, that we can support communities to actually lift Tasmanians up. What gets me down in this place is the inability of this government to be honest and truthful about the work that it is doing, the work that it is not doing, the mistakes that it is covering up, and the way that they simply seek to try to blame others for the circumstances that they've created. 

A little bit of commentary about the Budget: it is easy for the Premier to stand up and say, 'Things are difficult', or for the Treasurer to stand up and say, 'Things are difficult', and blame COVID, and then blame the chapters of time since COVID; but we know, and it's on the record, and it's reported, that this government, 11 years in government now, before COVID, were already running the state into financial disrepair. It was already on a pathway for budget mismanagement and financial mismanagement before COVID hit. 

Yes, COVID did have an impact in Tasmania, but for the years since, there are many reports that lead to the fact that the financial circumstances that we find ourselves in, in Tasmania right now, are directly due to the decisions that this government makes. They are directly due to the policy decisions that this government has made. 

They're ignoring the reality and ignoring the pressures in Tasmania, and continuing blindly down a road that is sending Tasmania broke. They're continuing down a road that is actually having a real and tangible and material impact on young Tasmanians, businesses in Tasmania, and community sectors in Tasmania, because of their high disregard for reality, and their high disregard for looking after Tasmanians before they look after themselves.

On the weekend, again in northern Tasmania, I had the absolute delight to attend the Ringarooma show. It's a show put on by the school students in a small community that is tight and connected. I'm a real believer that what happens in one level in a system happens in another level in a system. Ringarooma is a great indication of what can be possible in Tasmania. It is a community that comes together, supports each other, wraps around themselves. Even when it's bucketing with rain, they're outside having a great time together. Even in difficult times they stand up with each other. 

However, when you talk to Dorset House, that were represented at the show on the weekend, there is grave concern about the challenges for our communities and our community sector being able to continue to support Tasmanians in the area that Tasmanian Labor really care about; in the area of housing, support for housing, education, and health for Tasmanians. There are greater and greater pressures being applied to our community sector organisations, both in our cities, where we see it front and centre all the time, but also in our regional and rural communities. They're the communities that worry me. They're the communities that, when we're making decisions here in Hobart or in offices in Launceston or Devonport or across the coast, we need to remember. The small communities are the heart of economies in Tasmania. 

When we have our community houses expressing concern TasCOSS deeply concerned about the impact of this budget, which is full of cuts and broken promises, then this government needs to take a step back, stand up, take a breath and go, 'You know what? Maybe the time has passed for us to just keep kicking the can down the road. Maybe the time has passed for us to try and paper over the mistakes that we made. Maybe now we need to stand up and be honest with the community'.

When this government and this Treasurer - the third or fourth treasurer in as many months, as its been in Tasmania - says we're on a pathway to surplus, it grates me. The reality is, and the truth is, that it is not true. What annoys me - sorry, media - is that it gets reported because he says it. I know it's not true. 

What it means is that Tasmanians have this little glimmer of hope; but the little glimmer of hope is actually raising expectations, perhaps encouraging someone to spend a bit more than perhaps they have available to them, because they think things are going to get better. If this Treasurer can't actually create a positive cash outcome in his budget, then he can't stop debt, and if debt doesn't stop, then we can't make our way to surplus. He knows that. The government know that. Treasury officials keep telling them that, but they continue to ignore it and continue not to be truthful about the circumstances with Tasmanians. 

That is not fair, because we know there are Tasmanians in households, in small and big businesses, who have invested significantly off the back of the misinformation presented by this government. It breaks me when I have these conversations. The Premier on his feet just earlier said 'We are a government who will not let any Tasmanian be left behind. We are a government that works for every Tasmanian.' I don't know when the last time was he was in his electorate office, or when he last spoke to the electorate offices for his members, but I know on this side of the House we have people in our community coming into our organisations and our offices daily, having organisations advocating on their behalf, where they are unable to secure housing for themselves and their family, or to secure appointments with specialists in the health system for themselves, not for years ahead. 

They are concerned about shortages and pressures in an education system that isn't able to support teachers or the conditions in classrooms or classroom supplies, which therefore can't support their children. It is not truthful for this Premier to say that this government has not left Tasmanians behind. This government is intentionally misleading Tasmanians and causing them to make decisions not formed on real information. That is putting them in critical circumstances. 

We know, right across Tasmania now, that it's not only the physical health of Tasmanians that is under pressure, but also the mental health. For many Tasmanians in their business communities and in their social communities, there are a lot of people under pressure. There are great organisations in this state that are under financial pressure as well, and that, because of the lack of support from this government, are not able to do the work required to ensure that they can wrap their services around all Tasmanians.

There is an increasing number - a really worrying and terrifying increasing number - of young, hard-working, successful Tasmanians that are at the brink and the edge of their mental health, and that's not okay in the state of Tasmania. 

One of the things over the week ahead that I'm going to be calling on and interrogating through the Estimates process as we go forward, but also through the GBEs processes, is to bring out the truth of the Budget and bring out the truth of the financial circumstances for the people of Tasmania, because Tasmanians deserve it. This government needs to be held to account. You've heard our Leader and our shadow treasurer say that the role of Tasmanian Labor is to call on the government and keep them to account; to apply intense scrutiny, to put the screws down on this government who continue to let Tasmanians down; to pull out the mis-truths of this government and to have them stand up and face the realities of the circumstances that they have created. 

It is absurd that the Premier of Tasmania, just this morning, can stand on his feet and challenge the integrity of the Auditor-General of Tasmania, who, in writing has said that the circumstances around TT-Line in Tasmania have got to a point where he is concerned about their solvency. There could not be a much stronger statement made in the state of Tasmania that the credible and professional Auditor-General of Tasmania would feel compelled to put that in writing in his report.

The Premier of the day wipes that aside, and fair enough that he would trust the board of TT-Line, fair enough that TT-Line would get their own advice, but when questioned and pressured by the Leader of the Labor Party, asked whether the Premier himself had any alternate advice around the position of TT-Line and its solvency, he said: 'I don't know'. 

I don't know many premiers around the country who, when faced with a state-owned company - not a government business enterprise, as the Premier would have us believe, but a state-owned company - who, when suggested that there were solvency issues, wouldn't immediately get their own advice. If there is advice, we challenge the Premier to table it. The Treasurer himself was speaking to us about some advice today, but wasn't willing to table that when requested through interjection from this side of the House. What is written in those documents? What is coming for Tasmanians because of the absolute failure of this government to deliver on what is reputed as one of the greatest assets to Tasmania? 

Tasmanian Labor, in our past, successfully purchased and delivered, on time and on budget, the Spirits that we have servicing Tasmania now. They're important not only because they're important to the reputation of our tourism industry, but because they move the premium products that are grown and produced here in Tasmania across Bass Strait. They're important because of the freight tasks that they play. When Tasmanians were told untruthfully that there would be increased capacity on that run earlier last year, they invested in that. They invested off the back of that. Many people put themselves under financial pressure because of the mistruths of this government.

One of the things that is horrendous to continue to hear is this government saying they're being open and honest with Tasmanians; but we know that it was only relentless pressure by Tasmanian Labor that in fact ever even started the idea that the government would be honest about the circumstances that have been unravelling around TT-Line in Tasmania. 

We know that it's not at an end. We know from this government's inability to respond to questions around TT-Line in an upfront and in a straightforward way that there has to be more coming down the line. There has got to be greater hurt. 

Every time there's something that puts a financial impact on Tasmanians through their inability to deliver, it puts pressure on the system, and means that there is less for Tasmanians. The more interest that's paid on bailouts, the more money that is lent for bailouts, the more money that is put into things that this government can't deliver well, means there's less for Tasmanians, less for health services, less for housing, less for education, there's less to support young people into jobs and to support our economy. There's less certainty in investment. When this government is not honest with people, then people are challenged to make the decisions to invest.

One of the greatest intentional mistruths - and I hate sometimes where you can't use just blunt language in this place - but one of the greatest things that this government has done in recent times, where they have intentionally preyed on the pain points of Tasmanians that we don't see at all in this Budget, is TasInsure. You set aside the concerns about TT-Line that operationally might be challenging. You cannot ignore the realities of this government's intentional misleading of Tasmanians through the election to put forward an idea around TasInsure that they never intended and knew they never had the capability to deliver. TasInsure preyed on the pain points of Tasmania in the northeast, which I've spoken of already. I know farmers who have had horrendous increases in their insurance premiums, and we know that there is a problem with insurance. You can't actually pretend to provide a solution to a pain point to a problem with something that's not going to deliver because it just creates worse circumstances for our farmers, for our businesses, for individuals and households across Tasmania. 

For this government to go so far as to present themselves up with their jackets and their hats and their shop fronts around TasInsure and say - maybe they could have just stopped at the point where they said we're going to create this insurance offering for Tasmanians - but they actually went further to say that it's going to reduce premiums and reduce grocery prices. Tasmanians off the back of that sort of offer, would think, 'You know what, we're going to back in the Libs in this election because of the promise they've made.' 

However, in this budget, there's not one reference, not one reference in the Budget speech, not one reference in the Budget documents about TasInsure. It is a complete scam, and that is what's underpinning this government at the moment. When you have this government presenting these opportunities to Tasmanians, making promises to Tasmanians, and Tasmanians making their decision to support this government off the back of that, that's just something that they should be all ashamed of. That this Premier wrote letters to the aquaculture industry, to the salmon companies, to the greyhound trainers of Tasmania and said, 'You know what?' I have heard people tell me - I have heard Liberal Party voters tell me that they were told that, 'You can't trust Labor because they will just do a deal with the Greens and they will shut down the salmon industry or they will shut down greyhounds.' 

Yet right now, here and now, we have a Liberal Party that put in writing their support for the greyhound industry, for the salmon industry, and just weeks later turned their back on them. I've been out to the races, I've met some of these families who for generations have been backing in a sport that they love, have been backing in the animals that they love, who now have kids and grandkids who wanted to see a future in this industry, who have actually established themselves on a pathway to be active in something that they are passionate about. 

These are good people. These are good people from our community and without regard for Tasmanians, without regard for the impact on them, their lives, their mental health, their physical wellbeing, the wellbeing of their animals. Just to rip that out from them and the future and their futures in Tasmania is horrendous and the Premier should be ashamed.

To have written letters to the salmon industry saying that 'We back you in and there's no way under any circumstances that we would ever do a deal with the protest parties of the crossbench,' and then just weeks later to rip that out from those communities is horrendous. 

I share a story - I've shared stories of the northeast - I want to share a story of the West Coast. Interjections from across this place before said, 'Tasmanian Labor will never stand up to Australian Labor when we need to be backing in Tasmanians.' I can tell you that you can't believe anything that this government says because Tasmanian Labor are on record. When we supported the communities of the West Coast, we stood up against the Australian government. We don't mind what colour or what flavour the Australian government is.

When there's a time to stand up for Tasmanians, we will do that strongly. We will do that relentlessly. We will do that because we actually care on this side of the House. We care for individuals, we care for families, we care for communities, we care for business. We care for the confidence of investment in Tasmania. On this side of the House, we care for the communities of the west coast. When I was in Canberra recently, on the way home, I got to have a chat to Salty, a well-known legend of the West Coast, who was there on parent help with the students from Strahan Primary School. 

If this side of the House didn't advocate for the west coast communities, for the communities of the salmon industry, there might not be a Strahan Primary School. I've mentioned Ringarooma, I've mentioned the northeast. The schools of Tasmania in our rural and regional communities hold those communities together and they are at risk from the mistruths of this government. 

One of the things that Tasmanians will get to see over the years ahead is that Tasmanian Labor are determined. We are committed to creating a positive future in Tasmania. Right now, there is a void of leadership and vision in Tasmania for the future this state could be, for the things that this state could deliver. Tasmanian Labor, we're at work. We are connecting and talking to and hearing from Tasmanians. We're understanding where the pressure points are. We are doing the work to support Tasmanians at a business level and at a community level.

This government is on notice. Tasmanian Labor, we're angry about what you're doing to Tasmanians. We will be relentless in our advocacy for Tasmanians. We are going to outwork you, we are going to outthink you, we are going to outpace you and when you continue to undermine Tasmanians, when you continue to take the rug out from under their feet, we are going to stand ready to stand with Tasmanians, to support our families, to support our businesses, to make sure Tasmania can have the future that it deserves and I know that we can create.

[3.40 p.m.]
Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Management) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to give my contribution on the 2025-26 interim State Budget. As the Treasurer has outlined, we are a government that believes in strong finances, strong services and strong families, which together will deliver a strong future for Tasmania.

I think that sums up what the Budget is about, the approach that we need to have over the course of this government's term, in the next four years, so that we can deliver the kind of services that Tasmanians need in health, in education, housing and public safety and the intergenerational infrastructure that Tasmanians rely on while also, charting a position back to long-term budgetary sustainability for Tasmania. Because we know that there have been significant impacts and challenges here in Tasmania, just as there has been in jurisdictions around the world that face similar challenges.

The investments in lives and livelihoods during the COVID pandemic. I think all Tasmanians would recognise that we went through that emergency better than just about any other place in the world. That was because of the investments through this government's budget so that we could support people with their health, their wellbeing and their economic opportunities.

Then after that, the important work of the commission of inquiry which has exposed decades of failure across successive governments and government institutions to keep children safe. There is no higher purpose of government than to protect people, and particularly our littlest Tasmanians.

From that, a generational investment in the safety of young people through government institutions and ensuring that there are the supports and services, there is the law-enforcement and there is the culture that is required to protect children into the future to rebuild trust and to say to all of those who have been harmed that we need to do better, we recognise that and we will.

Through those investments and the broader investments that we can see from the Premier's approach to Tasmania about really changing the dial for Tasmania, a place that has had fewer economic opportunities than other places around Australia, a place that has had lower life chances by virtue of the fact that people were born in Tasmania.

This budget and the series of budgets that have preceded it is about transforming Tasmania's economic opportunity and social opportunity. Investing in Tasmanians so that we can grow the literacy level of our youngest Tasmanians, so that we can better care for older Tasmanians as they go through health challenges, so that we can keep Tasmanians safe, and of course, the investment and intergenerational infrastructure that will say to the next generation of young Tasmanians who are finishing school that 'Tasmania is a place for you. If you want to build a life here, if you want to get a job here, if you want to build a family and buy a home and have economic opportunities, then this is the place for you.' That's why this budget invests in Tasmania and invests big.

Of course, the Treasurer has outlined the importance of long-term fiscal sustainability, and this budget gets the balance right so that the investments that we've made in prevention, in our people, so that we can take our state forward and we can bring all of our people with us. That no Tasmanian is left behind, is locked in and secured for the future. 

Because of course, we've seen what slash-and-burn budgets have done to Tasmania in the past under other governments, particularly between 2010 and 2014. We don't want that to happen in Tasmania because we know what it does to services, and we know what it does to the economy, so it's a glide path back to financial sustainability through the Budget that delivers a surplus in the forward Estimates but also protects the generational investments that have happened in the future of Tasmanians. I thought the contrast between our Treasurer and Premier and the opposition leader and his shadow treasurer was quite telling, with the energy, the strength, the vigour, the belief in the future of Tasmania from our side, rather than what I heard from the opposition leader today, which was basically all about him. It reflected the shadow treasurer's approach when he was opposition leader and made those speeches, it was the same thing - no alternative budget, no vision, and all about the person speaking.

We heard the words 'I' and 'me' a lot during the opposition leader's speech. We heard very similar when the shadow treasurer was making similar speeches, we did not hear a lot about their alternative vision, their alternative budget, their alternative approaches. We know that the shadow treasurer is basically a feather duster these days and, sadly, it was disappointing to see Mr Willie displaying the kind of empty suit approach to politics that has clearly failed Labor in the past.

Now, when it comes to the government's investment and the approach and strategy in my portfolios, in the areas of police, fire and emergency management we are committed to ensuring that we continue to support our everyday heroes, who do everything that they can to keep our communities safe. In policing, we are growing the most trusted police force in Australia with 61 new police officers added to the force over the past year alone and, since we came to government in 2014, we have taken police numbers from 1120 to 1454. That's a growth of 334 police officers on the ground in our communities, keeping Tasmanians safe.

I pay tribute to you, Speaker, and your role as a predecessor of mine and also Mr Shelton as well. I am very grateful for the work that you both put in to continuing that growth and the investment in our people, so that they can support our community, it is paying dividends.

One reason growing Tasmania Police's general numbers is so important is that we now have a police force of sufficient size and scale for us to invest in specialist capabilities. This budget delivers funding for one of the critical recommendations of the commission of inquiry and that is to complete the statewide rollout of our Arch centres for victim/survivors. We have seen the extraordinary work that they do in supporting Tasmanians coming forward, sharing their experiences of sexual and family violence and needing help and needing choices. One of the things that the commission of inquiry demonstrated was the difficulty that people coming forward have faced in the past, when their choices are taken away through the process of seeking help. Arch centres are designed to be multidisciplinary to enable victim/survivors to choose police if they are seeking law enforcement response; social support services through partners like Sexual Assault Support Service (SASS) here in the south and Laurel House in the north. There's $4.5 million to then expand the Arch service provision to the north-west and I was really grateful for the opportunity to be there on the ground at the site in Burnie that is currently being retrofitted and delivered. It will be a beautiful facility where support can be provided in the most trauma-informed way, that gives victim/survivors agency and choice about their future at some of the most difficult times.

We have also seen significant investment in other areas of specialised support as well. Our special operations group that do incredible work to not just protect the community, but also protect Tasmanian frontline officers, are full-time for the first time and that group of highly trained operators are doing extraordinary work. We are finding that they are called out more and more because of the capability that they bring to bear, and we want to support them in their growth.

We have also seen, in a similar vein, the police safety package in this interim budget that delivers funding for key pieces of equipment that Tasmania Police need - beyond the powers and the penalties, the tools that they need to support the community and to keep themselves safe while doing so. Additional investments in new ballistics vests that are more comfortable for officers but also keep them safe in a more modern way. The taser rollout, which will be vital in ensuring that Tasmania Police have more tools in the toolkit when they are responding and have choices when it comes to the use of force.

Not to forget the wands that are key to delivering on the commitments of Reid's law so that we can make sure our police officers are able to search people carrying dangerous articles - knives, machetes and other weapons - in our public places. That funding is already backing our police officers, with 30 wands already here in Tasmania and we're keen to make sure that Tasmania Police are utilising these tools. Over the last six months, the 15 they had from the trial have helped secure charges against 300 people carrying knives and other deadly weapons in public places. We know with more investment we'll be able to take even further action on that. 

Last week we tabled Daniel's Law, so we can put the rights of children first rather than the rights of predators. I believe all parents understand that need and budgets have supported our new Family and Sexual Violence Command that has been stood up in recent years to provide additional specialised operators who can ensure that these convicted sex offenders are complying with their reporting obligations and that the community is safe. Daniel's Law will help to build on that, providing information to parents and communities that they need to protect their children and to stay safe.

The interim budget for our firies and SES delivers an additional $2.5 million for a reinvigorated Volunteer Infrastructure Investment Fund (VIIF) providing support to both the Tasmania Fire Service (TFS) and the SES. We are a volunteer-led organisation in the Tasmanian fire and emergency services. Nine out of 10 people who get on a fire truck are a volunteer; even higher rates when it comes to the SES, and the $10 million that we provided under the first tranche of the VIIF, you can see it hitting the ground in volunteer stations and units right across the state. It makes a meaningful impact on the way people engage with the possibilities of serving in the TFS. 

When you know that you have comfortable facilities that support our growing cohort of female volunteers, that provide a stronger response to the local area, and that ensure that our volunteers are kept safe through things like personal protective clothing separation. Those are the kind of meaningful investments, small but mighty, in a range of brigades and stations around Tasmania. I encourage members, when they are getting out and speaking with the incredible people who serve their state in the TFS, to go through their stations and see how these investments are helping to make the volunteering experience more comfortable, practical, inclusive and supportive, because we believe in these extraordinary people.

We are fortunate to have more than 5000 volunteers across the TFS and the SES. We're supporting them through additional investments in things like our new hubs at Wynyard, Kingston, and Rosebery. We want to grow the opportunities for these two organisations to work even more closely together in the future because they share so much in common and because when we deliver great outcomes across our emergency services, then that benefits everyone.

We have seen that strategy at work with the Tasmanian Government Radio Network, the first of its kind in the world at that level of capability; a $768 million project delivered on time, within budget, and that is simply one of the best things if you ask volunteers that we have been able to deliver collectively as Tasmanians for the safety of our state. Built on top of that, our nation-leading wellbeing program that supports our people, whether they're career or volunteers, from police, fire or SES. We even bring in our friends from the ambulance service for that journey as well.

Moving to Business, Industry and Resources, we know that Tasmania's economy is strong. We have spoken before about our record low unemployment, the highest business confidence in the nation, some of the highest wages growth in the nation. It was really encouraging to see the report that came out today that said that Tasmania is the second-best jurisdiction in the country when it comes to the ease of doing business. That is encouraging but as the Premier said, second is great but first is what we're aiming for.

We make no bones about that. We are keen to back our people who are working right across the economy, and I want to pay tribute to the Deputy Premier for his work to slash red tape through the building and construction sector through occupational licencing, trying to make a difference for the men and women that build our homes and help to build our state. There are big opportunities on top of that that I'm keen to be working through so that we can deliver a reduction in red tape, improve government customer service for people that are looking to engage and interact so that they can provide opportunities, provide services, and really help to build our state. There have been 51,000 more jobs since coming to government. When we talk about debt and we talk about some of the scale of these intergenerational infrastructure investments, think about the incredible Bridgewater Bridge, but of course the stadium, which I'm very much looking forward to supporting, thousands of jobs in construction, hundreds of apprentices, massive opportunities for tourism and hospitality right across Tasmania, not just here in Hobart. That's a transformative investment. Of course, it's a big investment, we understand that. It's more than a billion dollars, but our economy is a $40 billion economy now. We've tipped over that $40 million mark for the first time.

What that means is we have greater capacity to help grow, to provide opportunities for our young people, and to take our rightful place among the community of AFL states and attract people from right around the country to see our beautiful state. I had the opportunity to catch up with the Treasurer, or the Minister for Macquarie Point Urban Renewal, about the importance of the stadium the other day, and he mentioned that when the T20 cricket was on in Hobart, there were 1.2 billion viewers watching that cricket game and seeing beautiful Hobart and beautiful Tasmania. Imagine if that was in an iconic stadium. Imagine also if Australia had won, but I won't go too far into that. Imagine that happening in such a beautiful and iconic stadium, being able to see just what we can do here and the experiences that we can provide by coming to Tasmania. That will be a transformative opportunity. All I will say on top of that is, 'Go Devils.'

We provided a range of different support through the Budget for our major industrials: $22.5 million investment in Nyrstar so that we can help support that business, which is key to Australia's sovereign manufacturing supply chain. We want to support our major industrials. We've mentioned before the importance of ensuring that Canberra is playing its part as well. You look to the challenges that are happening at Liberty Bell Bay and Bell Bay Aluminium. It's important that the federal government steps up and matches Tasmania's support, because we understand that we need to provide support, but we cannot have one government achieve this alone. It's far bigger than Tasmania's balance sheet and that's why we believe in working with the federal government. I think it was very eloquently and articulately put about the importance of the federal government making good on their health investments. 

Also, if the world is in a more uncertain and more dangerous place than it's been since the 1940s, then we need to be ensuring that we have a federal government that steps in to back in our sovereign manufacturing supply chains because, if a country can't make things, it can't defend itself. We have a very important need to share the load. Many hands make light work and we're looking forward to working with the federal government to get a good deal for our businesses and Tasmania.

An amount of $650,000 in our renewable and sustainable forest industry to support innovation, strengthen collaboration across the supply chain, and to help bring new value-added timber to the market. We've said that the important strategic focus for the next four years is going to be uplifting value adding and getting more out of private growers in terms of timber. We will be backing that in through this project. We supported the King Island Dairy. The budget delivers $4.23 million of investment in King Island Dairy. No one in this place will forget that it was the Leader of the Opposition who called for a boycott of King Island Dairy just as that business was struggling. 

Talk about kicking Tasmanians when they're down. We are a government that doesn't kick them when they're down, we're a government that helps lift them up, and that's exactly what was achieved with the King Island Dairy. That business is now back in Australian hands. It's operational. It's delivering products. It's supplying jobs and it's supporting that beautiful community. Our Premier never gave up on King Island Dairy. The Opposition Leader called for a boycott and I'm really glad, Ms Finlay, that it's Jeremy Rockliff in the premier's Chair and not Mr Willie.

Of course, in skills and jobs, we're making significant investments, delivering with the lowest unemployment in the nation, new training opportunities. In 2024, 26,950 vocational education training enrolments supported by the Tasmanian government through subsidies. The latest data is showing that Tasmania has the highest completion rates in the nation - among our highest completions that we have had for very many years, and the investments that we're providing into TAFE and across the school are delivering results. The new student management system will transform the learning experience. The north-west Clean Energy Centre of Excellence will help to build the workforce that will power a renewable energy future. The completions package will back in Tasmania's highest completion rates in the nation and help it to grow as we help to break down barriers for people entering the skills and training system. Our automotive Southern Regional Training Centre will help make good after the devastating closure that happened with a major leak there. 

We're supporting further work to break down barriers. We want to acknowledge Mr O'Byrne and his support for Area Connect with $1.6 million in the Budget. We're continuing to invest in our hi-vis army that is helping to build the workforce to build Tasmania's homes and to build Tasmania's future.

[4.00 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2025. I will only be speaking for a few minutes, so, I will just make a few points. These contributions and responses to budgets are, from the opposition side, 'The government's all bad', and, from the government's side, 'The Opposition's all bad.' The pantomime that occurs in some of the accusations across the House, I think, misreads the temperature of Tasmania in terms of the parliament. They've delivered this pantomime of: 'not one party has a good idea or a bad idea.' I think we need to move on from that. I think we need to have a conversation where we acknowledge that at times we do agree but, where we disagree, we allow that debate to occur.

The reason why I hopefully won't be going on for long today is that this is an interim budget; a budget that's been essentially cobbled together after the second election in 18 months. The political dysfunction that this parliament has created has had an enormous impact on the Tasmanian community both in terms of the delivery of public services and in terms of the activity of the private sector. There is nothing worse, particularly in the private sector, than political uncertainty in terms of providing an investment environment and regulatory certainty; particularly in Tasmania, which is dominated by a whole range of industries, resource-extraction industries, that rely on good stable government, good delivery of budgets and services over predictable cycles. 

The fact that we've had two elections - the first election effectively was triggered by the dysfunction inside the Liberal Party, with two Liberal members defecting to the crossbench, and then the second election, which effectively was triggered by, and you can describe it in no other way, by the Labor opposition seeking to block supply. Both of those elections have created an uncertain environment for the public sector in terms of their ability to get on with the job to deliver for Tasmanians and also the private economy. 

This interim Budget is just that. The work that needs to occur over the coming months leading into the 26-27 budget is of more importance than a speech today. We know we are confronting some significant challenges in terms of the budget. There's $5 billion in net debt as we currently sit, trending to $10.3 billion by the middle of 2029. The forecast surplus that's in the paper is, I think, pretty speculative in 28-29, because effectively it is four years away. With forward estimates, I think everyone knows that when you get into the second and third and the fourth years, things change drastically. 

I took some time over the last couple of weeks to look back at some of the old documents and the old budgets, and to look at some of the predictions about where we were supposed to be heading and where we are now. There are actions and decisions that are made which will have a massive impact, some that are within the Tasmanian government's control and some that are beyond our control, particularly given the fact that such a large percentage of our revenue comes from federal grants and the GST receipts as well.

In this budget, I'm pleased that a number of the groups that a number of the community groups that I work strongly with have been supported: the Bike Collective, Troublesmiths, Dress for Success, Hamlet, the Neighbourhood Houses, although I believe that's an ongoing conversation in terms of the government support for the Neighbourhood House network and what they need to continue to deliver, but they deliver way beyond their capacity for the communities in which they operate and the communities in which they work with.

I am pleased that it wasn't an austerity budget. I have been through that period of time, where, in hindsight, it was an unnecessary austerity budget which caused massive impact on the Tasmanian economy, but also in terms of service-delivery, the key health, education, public transport, housing, et cetera. This interim budget essentially is a 90 per cent cut of what we had a couple of months ago, and I'm very much focused on what comes next because that's the work in front of all of us as parliamentarians and hence my question to the Treasurer today, about what kind of consultation.

When you look at the size of the challenge ahead of us, both in recurrent and capital, that the challenges ahead of us are not insignificant. We cannot wish them away. We need to work to ensure that the balance is right between supporting services, supporting our public sector workers, ensuring they're fairly paid, but also that we do not continue to rack up debt at a rate which is unsustainable and, in anyone's measure, the debt that we are racking up at the minute is unsustainable.

Context to that is COVID and the commission of inquiry; they were two elements that created significant expenditure for the state government. They are now in the rear vision mirror in terms of the major impact on the Budget. You cannot go past the critique of the Labor leader in terms of some of the poor decisions of this government that they do need to take responsibility for. Over $600 million unnecessarily wasted around the TT-Line-TasPorts debacle. There's no other word for it; it's a disgrace and it has cost the government money at a time where we can least afford it. You can say that the original budget for the port works was underdone, but regardless of whether that was an underdone element of the budget, it is still an impact on the Budget as we see it and there may have been, have we had a realistic figure of that expenditure, then the capital investment across all the departments may have been different in the knowledge of that.

There's significant investment: $3.5 billion into health next year; $2.4 billion into education; over half a billion in the transport; and in housing and community $238 million. All of those line items have been increased this budget from the last budget, whether it is enough. Like other states, we have significant challenges within our health and education systems that do need to be addressed, and I echo the sentiments of other states in terms of the federal government's responsibility, particularly in health and signing up to that agreement.

We should all be on a unity ticket for that. I know that there is much debate and much discussion across the country on that; if it were resolved, it will not solve the issues in health but it will go some way into supporting some of the challenges, access to elective surgery, access to the emergency departments, to outpatient care, to the range of services provided in health.

In terms of the other matters of the Budget. Again, it is a 80-90 per cent cut of the budget that was essentially blocked in the previous parliament, and I think that we should all focus on the coming months in terms of consultation. I stress to the Treasurer, just writing letters to organisations and having discussions about the money doesn't necessarily respond to the ever-evolving and changing needs of the Tasmanian community.

Let's make some smart decisions, let's not just look at a line item and go 'we can save some money here,' let's actually look at what's invested in our community by the state government and, again, having been through an austerity budget, let's not try, hellbent, to go to a surplus before it is due. Let's have a longer, softer landing to ensure we can bring the budget back to sustainability. The Tasmanian budget and the Tasmanian government expenditure is a higher proportion of our economy compared to every other state. The Northern Territory is obviously slightly different, but in terms of every other state, the Tasmanian government plays a much more important and significant role in terms of the economy and in terms of expenditure. Therefore, we need to be mindful of how, where and when we spend and how we save money over a period of time that doesn't create unnecessary hurt, unnecessary service dislocation or missing opportunities that will build a stronger, more diverse economy for Tasmania.

In the Leader of the Opposition's response to the Budget, which I thought was a good speech, there are elements where he sort of blames the crossbench for supporting the Liberal government: 'After 11 years, Tasmania deserves better.' I think they deserve better from the entire parliament, to be honest. The crossbench was cast into this role of providing stability because the three parties in the last parliament created such chaos that we had to go to another election. 

I didn't support the no-confidence motion which triggered the election earlier this year. It was the Greens and the Labor Party hell-bent on using the only blunt instrument they had, which was a no-confidence motion, which created a level of uncertainty. I call on the Leader of the Opposition particularly, that if they're seeking to drive change in their approach, don't blame the crossbench for propping up this Liberal government. The fact that we were given no option is more of a matter for him and his party, not for the crossbench. 

When he says that young Tasmanians feel like they have to leave Tasmania to get opportunities, which I encourage people to travel and enjoy the world, but they shouldn't have to leave if they don't want to, and if they want to come home, we should be able to give them something to come home to.

Again, we will debate this on Thursday, but be mindful that the stadium is an issue that I think goes a long way to diversifying the Tasmanian economy, to providing something for young people to stay here. You look at the jobs already that are coming in with the Tassie Devils, and the Tasmanians who've worked all over the world: Singapore, the UK, the US are coming home to Tasmania, really smart people. The Labor Party played politics with that issue from day one. They chose the politics of the stadium as opposed to supporting the good idea. If there is a good idea, don't oppose it just for the sake of politics.

Ultimately, that created the dysfunction for the first election with two members of the Liberal Party - predominantly that was the Liberal Party's responsibility - went to the crossbench to create that first election, and then the second election with the no-confidence around the budget. If they focused on that issue and said, 'Well, politics aside, we think this is good for Tasmania', we will hold you to account so you don't stuff it up. Again, there's a track record over there which we should all be aware of. Instead of choosing politics on that issue, actually think: 'Well, this might be a really good thing for Tasmania', and we will have the debate on Thursday.

If you really want to give young Tasmanians hope that this place can be better, when an issue comes up from the government, if you think it's a good thing, say it. Hold them to account, to deliver it well and to deliver it as the best it can possibly be. Don't choose the issue to play politics because you think you might get a couple of votes for it on the side.

The new Labor leader is the most authentic in his support for what the stadium and the multipurpose Macquarie Point Stadium will deliver for Tasmania from that side. I welcome his commitment to that, because in this House depoliticised it to the point. He's right, he will hold the government to account on expenditure. If we really want young Tasmanians to stay, we have to give them a reason. We have to rise to the challenge of that and support opportunities both in the public and the private sector, and in our community that make them want to come home and that give them the opportunity to stay.

This is an interim Budget. There's a fair bit of work to be done. Next year is going to be tough and I look forward to engaging with the government as best I can and holding them to account. They do need to be a better government; there's a number of examples of where they've failed. They need to be better and I, as a member of the crossbench, will continue to hold them to account on that basis, so I will support the Appropriation Bill.

[4.14 p.m.]
Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for Environment) - Honourable Minister for Environment and many other ministries, and I will go through a few of these as I speak today. 

Honourable Speaker, I have been listening really carefully to everybody who's spoken in the Chamber this afternoon, and I think it's fair to say I may be getting a little long in the tooth. I've been here now over a decade, and I've seen a lot come and go and I take the view and the perspective that when times are lean, it's the time you do your thinking work, it's the time you do your innovative work.

I'm grateful that the portfolios that I currently have, first, are open to that sort of work, and second, are those in which innovation and capability-development can happen during these times. We spend a lot of time doing that. Thought-leadership has been big on our agenda this year. I am very keen to update the Chamber on some of the things we've been doing there, but also talk a little bit about the Arts, which I love, and Heritage.

As you know, Heritage never has enough money. Well, not in the Arts either. We will speak to some of the things that we've been doing that are quite innovative there. The Budget that we've seen; we all know what's happened this year. It's been a long and arduous year, a challenging year, a year in which we've seen the budget tabled twice, in net effect. The Budget we have before us now is realistic. There is a sense of having to put our shoulder to the wheel, but of optimism and a dedicated sense of purpose, and I'm probably stealing the Treasurer's words, but I think they are correct.

Investing in Tasmania, investing in our kids, investing in our people, investing in what we love about our beautiful, heart-shaped island state is important to all of us, and that's what this budget delivers. It prioritises. We accept that, and there are always choices to be made in political life particularly in leadership, and leadership is not easy. Leadership requires making those choices and taking people with you on the journey. It addresses cost of living, health, education, public policy, public safety, roofs over people's heads, but more importantly for me, as the member for Clark, some very good things that I think my constituents are keen to hear about, and I will speak of some of those.

We've never seen unemployment so low in this state. I have spoken about this a number of times in the Chamber, but I am from an old Tassie family, been here, seen some ups and downs. I was part of a generation graduating from school, from high school, then matric as it was then called back in the 1980s, and unemployment was terrible. There were no jobs and an entire generation of young people left. We're back now. We've been out and abroad and all over the country. We've come back, many of us now, and we are building businesses, and we are supporting each other and we're into politics and we're helping organise volunteers, we're working with orchestras, we're doing good things in schools. We are helping people, particularly the next generation, to succeed here.

Of course, we want people to go out and travel and see the world and have those career opportunities. We also want the opportunities for people to come home, to be able to come back when they've done interesting things, bring those skills, bring that know-how and bring that diversity of thought here and embed it here in our island state. We've always done this. It's a benefit of being an island. We look globally and we reach out and we bring those skills and capabilities here.

We have to get the settings right to make sure that our businesses do well. Every little bit that the government does to help is very well regarded, I believe, by our business community. I've heard a bit of conversation about the hydroelectricity building of the dams and how we did all that. Of course, that was in the 1930s originally when grandfather and great uncle, A G Ogilvie, travelled through Europe and particularly through Russia, looked at the hydroelectricity dams and came back and rebooted Tasmania's hydroelectricity systems. He imported engineers, reached out to the Jewish diaspora that was having such an awful time in Europe, brought them here, worked with people to bring the skills to the state. 

I hope that in some ways I'm able to have a bit of that philosophy and do in a similar way, particularly in the tech sector, to reach out to the world to say to the smart and bright and incredible people who we have all over the nation and all over the world - come to Tasmania, bring your tech business here. You want to set up an app? Do it here. Do it here because we're a cool little state. We all know each other, and we will help.

I know that there is a huge amount of energy and effort and capability going into our education system, into our health system. These things are very, very important. Simply put, $10 million a day is invested into our health system; it's important, but the federal government, which has had us on the tight line for too long with health funding and also with telecommunications funding, needs to take their foot off the brake and make sure that Tasmania gets what it deserves. We want to make sure that we are on the same footing as all other states and territories and that we don't end up not just with a digital divide between the 'haves' and 'have nots' on the eastern seaboard of Australia, but that our kids our health sector, our schools, our education facilities, our businesses, our scientists, our researchers, the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) and Antarctica have capability to connect into cutting-edge telecommunication services.

This sits at a federal level. I have tried time and time again. I will continue to try to get that happening. In the meantime, I see other states and territories, particularly as I've said across the eastern seaboard, get their additional cables, get their additional funding. This is stuff that needs to happen here and now, and no doubt we'll have a good chance to talk about it all during Estimates.

We've had some amazing successes. When I said before that the lean times are the times where you do your thinking, you do your skunkworks and come up with good ideas, you do your innovation and your thought leadership.

I was particularly thinking about the work that is ongoing work of government that we all do in our portfolios, and I believe we may be in a little bit of a systemic situation where we look to the budget. What's in the budget; what's new in the budget; but we need to remember that we are running government, we're running portfolios, and we have projects that are underway and it is some of these projects I believe that are giving us our most incredible results. Some of these projects, and I believe Mr Jaensch will touch on some of them that he was instrumental in designing and developing and strangely I had the benefit of announcing so I want to recognise that, and thank you because they're so successful.

In particular, of course, I'm thinking about our plastics recycling, recycle rewards, millions of plastic bottles, millions. In fact, our system is more successful than any other state and territory in the nation and I've made a little bit of an art form of heading out to hang about to see who's doing recycling and have a chat to people who are doing that. One of our most valued recycling hub/centres is the one in Claremont in the shopping centre. I go out there and I give some of the bags that you need to put your plastic bottles in, and families appreciate that, just to see who's doing the recycling and to ask people what they think of it and why they're doing it.

My kids are into it as well. They have a house full of plastic and then they go and recycle that. They donate it, which I think is great. I donate my refunds as well but in Claremont what I see are young families pitching up: mum, dad, the kids, little kids as well, who've been doing their recycling. They're saving up for their bicycles, they're donating to their school, and when I say to them, are you enjoying it? Is this good? The parents who are probably a bit younger than me now because, as I said, I am a bit long in the tooth, tell me that it's been a great thing in their house to teach their children about environmental issues, about plastics recycling and about the benefit of looking after their environment. That's a really lovely anecdote about how well that has gone down.

People obviously know because I've spoken over it many times in this place of my passion for science and tech, which is my background. Of course, personally as an IP lawyer by trade, I've mentioned, but I've had a global career as well in the tech sector, in telecommunications, major projects and infrastructure. I am absolutely delighted to be the Minister for Innovation, Science and the Digital Economy. Of course, it is at a time when we are seeing a global explosion of innovation and opportunity for global engagement from here because the future is digital. You can have any job you want coupled with work from home here, delivering services or capability to there. I would love to see a situation where we build this up - we have to get those subsea cables into place, federal government, hear me there - but I would love to see a situation where our university and our STEM campus takes that leading role working with industry, particularly with our Antarctic expertise, and our scientists, to set us up to be the global player in the niche areas that I know we can be. We are experts in climate change study and science. We are experts in marine science. I know Mr Garland is keen on that and I'm endeavouring to work with you genuinely to work through the marine environment act.

We want to make sure that our STEM campus is up and running. We have to find ways to make that happen - we're working on that hard. We, as a government are looking at digital transformation both within government, and we're working across the sector and across industry. We work closely with TasICT, the ACS, and others and I'm really fortunate as the responsible minister to have very good and strong working relationships with industry and our tech sector, from Cisco to Telstra, to getting over there to Palo Alto and Seattle. I'm a regular visitor to the west coast to Silicon Valley. The connections that we make there are really good for Tasmania. The state government is the biggest procurer of tech services and capabilities in the state. We want to make sure that we have those strong partnerships. We are actively working with industry to do more together, and this is a good thing. I will continue to advocate strongly for our STEM campus, and I think we have a shared perspective on the value of education in this place, and I've underscored that as well.

We're continuing to deliver great outcomes for Tasmania's environment. I am super pleased to be the Environment minister with responsibility also for climate change. I know that this is a meaningful area that matters to everybody regardless of their political persuasion. This is about being human and this is about looking after the environment and, if we do it and we do it well, the abundance of our environment will look after us. We need to get that balance right and to be careful. We're known for it, but we can't take our foot off the pedal. We reaffirm our commitment to protecting Tasmania's unique environment and, importantly, biodiversity.

We want to see institutions that are strong, sensible and sustainable for our future. We want environmental management systems to be well supported. We've put over $22 million into environmental management analytical services and threatened species within the Department of Natural Resources and Environment. A lot of words there, but what we're saying is we are investing in biodiversity, we are investing in threatened species, and we're continuing to invest over $8 million through the Threatened Species Fund, including critical programs that we love, such as the Maugean skate breeding program and orange-bellied parrots. I had the great pleasure of holding one of those little parrots. I had my gloves on to make it very, very safe for the parrot. I had the benefit of visiting that breeding program. It's just superb. The people who work there are amazing.

I have been down to visit the Maugean skate in Taroona - what a great facility. I think they've just received the second tranche of their federal funding. When you open up the little lid on the tanks where the baby Maugean skates are held and, I guess, the mother Maugean skate, they're curious, and they come up and look at you. It's incredible stuff. That breeding program is successful. We have the Threatened Species Strategic Partnership Grant Program with a $600,000 funding pool. It is really worthwhile, with great environment outcomes from seven grant recipients in round one. We will see more in round two.

We were transforming our waste and resources sector. I've given you the anecdote about how successful and how loved our recycling program is. Great credit to Roger Jaensch for his design, which landed so well.

We are doing a lot of work through the Waste Industry Resource Recovery Board. A strategic perspective is required, not forgetting local communities and doing the engagement piece there, that's really needed.

I'm very protective of my important role in relation to the Environment Protection Authority. I've said, and I will say it again, that they are independent. I do not dictate terms. I'm happy to engage and convey information backwards and forwards, but it would be wrong of me to ever direct it one way or another. I'm careful about that. We have provided funds to upgrade their air-quality monitoring network; this is a tech sector thing. There's nothing more important than proving we have the best and cleanest air in the nation, particularly as it goes directly to our tourism sales pitch, which is really well-received, I think, nationally. You can smell it when you get off the plane; you can just feel that fresh air. Well, we can prove it now because we've upgraded the monitoring.

Innovation is top of the agenda right across everybody's portfolios but, as the minister for Innovation, I get to do that strategic piece which I love. We are doing some good work, particularly in relation to AI, with our dialogue with the university, bringing a range of people together around one table to get some creative friction going about what we can do more, and what does the future economic development of Tasmania, powered by the tech sector, look like. This work is really important.

In relation to climate change, we love that we were the first Australian jurisdiction to achieve net zero emissions. We've maintained that for nine years and our government will continue activities to support this. We've dedicated more than $9.5 million in this budget to support the work of the Climate Change Office in Renewables, Climate and Future Industries Tasmania . They work so hard; a big callout to all of the staff in that section. They do incredibly well.  Our emissions-reduction and resilience plans are out there. Businesses and industry have been part of that dialogue. They've engaged, we're agreed, and we have 98 practical cross-government actions that we're working upon.

My approach is to coordinate, consult, turn up, be there, listen, and work out how we can pick out the good ideas and drive those forward; and, no, it's not always about the big dollar signs. We heard from Mr O'Byrne on a similar theme it has been a long and arduous year, particularly for everybody in this chamber. We need to find ways of getting things done, moving things forward and putting Tasmania first in a scenario where we have budget constraint. We're not always awash with money, but we've got good ideas. Bringing people together to fire those up is important. 

This brings me to the second-last piece, which is about creativity, arts and screen. I am a huge and very proud supporter of our arts sector and I have always been. I think it's customary for me at this point in the speech to again mention that I was taught the oboe as a child and played in the Tasmanian Youth Orchestra, so, I feel that I am 'alum' in the music sector. Moving on to my days as an IP lawyer, where I thought I would be a music lawyer but ended up being a technology lawyer - that can happen. I'm a huge supporter of this sector, and we've provided more than $2.4 million each year to our beloved Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra. I was able to negotiate an additional $4.5 million to support our orchestra and the Federation Concert Hall, which has been so important to our city, to our state, and to my family, who have had a lot to do with it over the years. I'm so pleased that we're able to assist them. 

There's $1 million to the Theatre Royal. It's our oldest theatre, we love it. The Hedberg goes from strength to strength and we're looking at what more we can do there. We have a range of artistic events and festivals, we support those and we do that groundwork from the bottom up.

There's $13 million to the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery and $16 million to Arts and Screen. 

The Heritage sector always needs more. It contributes $976 million to our gross state product every year. It's a really substantial piece and we love to show it off in our tourism ads. We need to invest more in that as well, but we'll work on that.

I will just wrap up now with the final and most important piece, which I'm absolutely delighted about, and that is - as the new, and I think, inaugural minister for Multicultural Affairs. I have enjoyed it so much. We have more to come. Please come to Diwali. I have sent you all an invitation. We have it in the House communities. I will fight for Neighbourhood Houses; community gardens are on my agenda, and we will be bringing forward some new ideas there as well. We have announcements to make, and we'll do those heading into Estimates.

[4.35 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on this year's budget or, as we've heard, an interim budget, which is something new for this parliament. 

I want to reflect on something that the Leader of the Opposition said in his contribution this morning. We thought the budget the year before last was pretty bad. It contained sweeping cuts across the public sector, job cuts, cuts to service funding. Indeed, the then treasurer, Michael Ferguson, was asked by a news reporter if he was the worst treasurer Tasmania had ever seen and, as Josh Willie said this morning, the former treasurer didn't answer that question. He now could answer that question in the negative because what we've actually seen is, for the first time in Tasmania's history, a Treasurer bring down a budget that didn't get passed. That was former treasurer, Mr Barnett, last year.

Mr Jaensch - It's not that it didn't get passed. We didn't get to debate it because you blokes closed the place down. It's wrong to say it didn't get passed. 

Ms HADDAD - We didn't get to debate it, says a member for Braddon. We've heard a lot of that today: that it's the opposition's fault -

The SPEAKER - Sorry to interrupt, I am going to ask all members to remember to say 'honourable' Leader of the Opposition, for example.

Ms HADDAD - Sorry. The honourable member for Braddon, Mr Jaensch, says that it's the opposition's doing that we ended up in an election. We know that's not true. That wasn't the only option available to the government when that no confidence motion passed, which was the view of the parliament, not just the opposition. It had support across the parliament. The reason for that no confidence motion was the budget that was handed down by former treasurer, the honourable Deputy Premier.

Here we are now, with former senator Mr Abetz handing down his first budget, an interim budget. That is a new thing for Tassie. We are not quite sure what that means, but what we have seen in the community is widespread concern that what it means is there's worse to come next year. That is what we've seen, after all, for each of those subsequent ministers handing down budgets, worse figures year on year, which ultimately means worse outcomes for Tasmanians year on year.

We heard the opposition speak a number of times in this place about how we've had 11 years of poor government decisions from the Liberal Party and worsening budgets and worsening outcomes. Each budget we seem to be spending more but getting worse results for Tasmanians. That's not just about the predictable politics of government versus opposition either. It is there in numbers, in black and white. It is there in numbers when we look at the effect on the community of the decisions, the policy decisions and the spending decisions that this government has chosen to make over 11 years. That is what I want to focus on in my contribution today, the effect of the government's poor record on people.

First, I will talk about some of the fundamentals that people need just to get by. We need a safe and warm roof over our head, particularly in our cold Tasmanian climate; we need access to education for our young people, safe and secure work for our adults, and healthcare where and when we need it.

When you look at the health system in Tasmania, there is no doubt that it is terribly broken. Health is a challenge nationwide, there is no denying that, but while this government continues to fail to address some of the systemic issues in the department, the health system, and in our chronically ill population, we will never see those things improve. You only need to look at some of the statistics. Our elective surgery list, for example, has increased 14 per cent from this time last year. There are now over 9000 people on that elective surgery waitlist. I wish it was called something else, because sometimes when people hear 'elective surgery' reported in the press, they think that means the surgery is somehow a choice, something cosmetic perhaps, but it is far more serious than that. The department's own definition of elective surgery is that it is surgery that is planned and can be booked in advance as a result of specialist clinical assessment. Elective surgery is considered medically necessary and may be required urgently, but it is not conducted as a result of an emergency presentation. That is the key difference. 

What we have seen year on year, when you compare the emergency surgery list to the elective surgery waitlist, there are people coming off the elective surgery waitlist because they were waiting for so long that they got so sick and ended up having the surgery when they presented to the emergency department. That's how dire things are in our health system.

The outpatient waitlist - again, that's medically necessary treatment, referrals to specialists; referrals that mean that you can't progress down the health pathway that your medical practitioner wants you to until you have had that outpatient appointment - that has increased by nearly 10,000 Tasmanians since this time last year. When I looked at that figure, I thought I must have written it down wrong, because it's astronomical. There are now nearly 70,000 people waiting on that outpatient waitlist. Until the government starts to address the workforce challenges that are facing our health system, we won't see those things turn around.

Meanwhile, we also have ambulance wait times at a 12-month high and we have health workers and other state servants across the state service having to resort to industrial action just to be heard by this government. Unfortunately, the government is still refusing to listen. We saw that after the recent stop-work action - and let me be really clear, no union takes stop-work action lightly. No-one comes to work and flippantly decides, 'We're going to go on strike today.' There is an enormous amount of negotiation that goes on before a workforce comes to that decision to take stop-work action. There is an enormous amount of work that goes into trying to negotiate in good faith with the employer, which is the government. In this instance, the government have refused to come to the table and simply gave a bad-faith ultimatum and demanded that state servants accept it. So, of course, they had to take the extraordinary actions that they did.

Health workers, teachers, staff across schools, across the State Service, took action recently in all areas of the state. Remarkably, what we saw was a vindictive approach from the government where they refused to meet with the unions that took that industrial action. How bad-faith is that? To see the unions and their members who have been pushed so far that they have no choice but to take stop-work industrial action, and the government's reaction is to say, 'Bugger off, we are not going to meet with you. We are not going to talk to those unions.'

Here is what the Assistant Secretary of the Community and Public Sector Union, Natalie Jones, said recently. That union represents much of the State Service, and they were one of the many State Service unions who joined together to take action recently. Natalie Jones said that a short-term deal would only worsen the problem. She said that:

After cancelling and postponing negotiations with unions, the Tasmanian government's offer to kick the can down the road has only served to deepen workforce frustration and erode trust. Public sector workers deserve more than stopgaps. We know that current workforce challenges will only get worse due to short-term thinking and delaying discussions. What the workforce needed was a commitment that salary increases would be backdated if negotiations ran beyond December. Instead, they have been presented with a one-year deal that would widen the pay gap between them and the mainland. [TBC]

Indeed, we know that there is a widening gap between mainland and Tasmanian salaries. In 2013, Tasmanian government state service employees were paid roughly the same as their mainland count counterparts; this is analysis by Martin Goddard. By 2022, a 6.9 per cent pay gap had emerged between Tasmanian state salaries and those of the mainland. Further analysis by Max Douglas and the McKell Institute show that public sector wage increases in Tasmania were lower than inflation from 2017 to 2024. It's effectively a wage cut. It's a real wage cut when wage increases are lower than inflation, which they were from 2017 to 2024. It means that people can't keep up with the cost of living, that's what it means. People we know even comfortable incomes are having to make decisions about essential spending on things like medical costs, on food, on groceries. People even with two incomes, two working adults in the home are still nonetheless having to make really tough decisions about what they can afford to do. 

Really importantly, the stop-work action that was taken by public sector unions this month and last month was not just about pay. The stop-work action was about much more than salaries; it was about safe working conditions, and that's what the government has failed to listen to the unions when they speak to them about. That's what they've failed to listen to and take on board. At the stop-work action that I attended here in Hobart, we heard from an incredibly impassioned teacher who wanted to make it really clear that it's not about pay, it's about safe workplaces. He talked about the fact that he had been physically assaulted multiple times in recent months in his workplace.

Yet, during this stop-work action, he felt teachers were being made to look like they were greedy moneygrubbers. They're not. They are doing some of the most important work that we have. We know that education is the gateway to prosperity. Yet, we have teachers and support staff who are being routinely assaulted in their workplace. That's not okay. 

The Australian Education Union, which is also part of that public sector-wide stop-work action, released figures about some of those workers' compensation claims. Not every assault or incident gets to the point of a workers' compensation claim. It's important to note that. These are the numbers of people who have actually been assaulted or injured so badly, not all of them are assaults, but who have suffered such a serious workplace injury that they've gone to the point of a worker's compensation claim. In 2023, that number was 479 people. 

In 2024, it had risen to 578, and this year, it's risen to 608. That's the combination of psychological and physical injury experienced by teachers and non-teaching staff across Tasmania's education system. It's clear that we don't have safe workplaces and we have an Education minister who comes in here and says to us, 'It's not the teachers that she's angry with, it's the unions.' Well, that just says it all, doesn't it. It says that we have a government that does not understand the fundamental role of a union to represent their workers and their workplaces. Teachers are union members; support staff are union members. They are the ones fighting for pay and conditions, and the government fails not only to listen to them, but to understand that fundamental fact about collective action and collective representation. 

It's pretty sad because the result of it is that I don't think we can expect to see much better in next year's budget. That's certainly what the community services sector has alerted us to. As a community, they are very worried about what next year's budget is going to look like, and we know that there are a number of community organisations that have received letters from the government saying that the program that they run, that was promised either in the previous budget or in the election, is still a priority but it won't be in this year's budget. We have to wait till next year's budget. Well, that does not fill community organisations with a lot of faith. I can tell you that, because these are organisations that are already crumbling under the pressure of increased service demand. I've talked about that in this place before.

During and since COVID, there has been an exponential increase in demand on community organisations right across the board. Tasmanians are seeking support from things like food relief and neighbourhood houses and others for the first time ever in their lives, including working people who are doing it really tough. Those organisations are now at breaking point; they are at the point where they are going to have to start shedding services or staff or both of those things. Now they have letters in their hands saying, 'Don't worry, we're going to fund you next year.' Well, you can forgive those organisations for not having much faith in the idea that a letter from Jeremy Rockliff means anything to their bottom line, because we saw what letters of support meant in the election. Days before he walked back his support for greyhounds and salmon industry workers, he told them by letter that they had his support.

No matter what you think of those industries, what that tells me is that a letter from Jeremy Rockliff or from Eric Abetz that says, 'Don't you worry, we'll support you next year,' means absolutely nothing. Sector organisations are right to be loudly voicing that call, and voicing that call they are. They are making it very clear that they don't have faith that next year the government is going to do the right thing. I will share with you some of what a couple of those organisations have said. Shelter Tasmania, which is the peak body for the housing and homelessness sector, said that:

Specialist homelessness services are at breaking point, and September figures show that more than 5,300 households remain on the Homes Tasmania's waiting list. [TBC]

They note that Anglicare's recently released report on front door services highlights a significant increase in demand across all cohorts, including among those who are working and who historically have not needed access to services. That's up by 34 per cent. That's a remarkable increase in demand that shows that our community is suffering, but it also shows that those organisations are heaving under that pressure.  A 34 per cent increase in demand while they're actually having real-world cuts in their service contracts because they haven't had things like indexation ongoing and they haven't had safe long-term funding agreements, all things that the government promised back in 2014. They have not been delivered. 

Those organisations are doing it tough just as the people who they support are doing it tough. I continue to quote from Shelter Tasmania at the time of the budget. They said their concern:

… is that there will be significant cuts in the next state budget at the time when our community is already living on the edge. 

They note that: 

housing is a key social determinant of health, employment, and education. Without it, every part of society suffers. [tbc]

I will share with you a story of a woman who I advocated for recently who, after quite a bit of advocacy from my office, has now been housed. She came into my office to follow that up and to say that she was grateful for the advocacy that she had received. We are, of course, very keen to provide that advocacy to anyone who needs it. As I said to her, and I've said to others, it isn't how the system is meant to work. You shouldn't need a letter from a politician in order to get housed in this social and public housing system that we have here in Tasmania that is so broken.

The story that I wanted to share with the House is that she told me that since they've been housed, she has now been able to go back to work. She has now been able to access health services that she has needed for a very long time. Her adult daughter is now back at TAFE studying for a qualification. These are the kinds of things that people miss out on when you're not safely housed. These are the kind of things that people can't do. You can't access healthcare services in the way that you need to if you're sleeping rough or couch surfing or sleeping in a tent or in a shelter. 

Shelter Tasmania has also noted how urgent the need is in emergency accommodation. They note that women and children escaping domestic and family violence remain amongst those most at risk across the state. They say that when shelters are turning away nine out of 10 women seeking help, it shows how urgent the need. It didn't use to be like that. There used to be a well-supported service system that meant that if you were escaping a violent relationship, you knew there was help there for you. You could go to a shelter, and you would probably be there a few weeks, maybe three months tops. Then there would be somewhere safe for you to go, either into the social or public housing sector, into emergency temporary accommodation, or into the private rental sector. That's just not the case anymore. Shelters are full. Emergency rapid rehousing accommodation is full. There is very little turnover in the social and government housing sector. 

I know those opposite will say that these things are pressures facing the whole country, that housing costs of manufacture and construction have gone up. Yes, that's true. What we've also seen over 11 years is systems like our housing system and our health system simply not be front of mind for a government that is much more focused on the big end of town and looking after their corporate backers than they are looking after the Tasmanian people who rely on essential services like health and housing. That's what I want to focus on this year in the Budget: the real effect of budget mismanagement by this government over 11 years on Tasmanian people.

[4.55 p.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I start my budget reply speech by congratulating the Treasurer for at least acknowledging what many Tasmanians have known for some time; that is, the state budget is in a bad way and in need of serious repair. In that sense, it's an improvement on the last two budgets where the government refused to acknowledge the problem, but the Treasurer is still refusing to recognise the real source of our budget woes. Yes, two elections in three years haven't helped; but let's be honest, those elections were called by the Premier, and they were fought on promises the state could never afford. As economist, Saul Eslake, has pointed out time and again, it was the pork-barrelling, the money for mates, the unfunded promises to buy their way back into power that has driven Tasmania's finances off a cliff.

If this government was serious about fixing the budget, it would start by banning pork-barrelling before the next election becomes another taxpayer-funded auction of vanity projects and vote buying schemes like TasInsure or that $1.8 billion stadium. Instead of accountability, we get denial; and if you won't admit your mistakes, you can't change your ways. The Treasurer proudly tells us Tasmania's economy has grown faster than any other state over the past seven years. That's not the result of sound management. That's the result of debt-funded spending on an infrastructure program which wouldn't look out of place in China or Dubai. 

The numbers speak for themselves: cashflow deficits from investing activities will hit $2 billion this year, rising to $3 billion by 2029. Total debt this year: over $10 billion. By 2029, even after the so-called austerity measures, that debt will almost double to $19 billion. In a state of just over half a million people, that is not sustainable, and it's not sensible. Meanwhile, the cost of servicing that debt is exploding. Interest payments will rise from $248 million this year to $618 million by 2028-29, more than doubling in four years. 

There are some positive initiatives in this budget and they deserve recognition. I won't name them all, I just want to single out a few which I wasn't aware of until now. There is increased funding to health and education. The Care@home program will expand virtual emergency and hospital-in-the-home care; a sensible reform backed by evidence, which is very likely to increase access to services and reduce the health expenditure in the long term and a reform I called for during my election campaign. There's modest extra funding for the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies; long-overdue support for our world-class Tasmanian fisheries and marine research. There's funding for the Burnie Rhododendron Garden, and a youth participation framework to give young Tasmanians a real say in decisions that affect them.

I want to talk about the gaps in services that my constituents are telling me about. The number one issue that comes up time and time again is health. There is no rheumatologist or pain management specialists in the north-west; good luck getting an appointment with an ENT specialist. I'm hearing stories about a problematic work culture at the North West Regional Hospital, which is clearly causing difficulties in the hospital with recruiting and retaining specialists. This has a very big impact on my community. 

Several members of the community have raised the issue of the permanent loss of the hydrotherapy pool in Burnie since the closure of the North West Regional Hospital pool. The government's solution to that has been to co-locate it at the North West Support School, but this was done with next-to no thought for North West Support School staff, families and key people involved with the school.

Next is access to community services and education. The Strive to Drive program, delivered as part of the services offered by the Circular Head Aboriginal Corporation, helps learner drivers build confidence and work towards their driving assessment. They offer support to people on low incomes, young people without access to a supervising driver or vehicle, and members of multicultural communities facing language and cultural barriers. Having the ability to drive is important for individuals in Circular Head because of the lack of public transport.

Further expanding student accommodation at Hellyer College in Burnie to meet demand, the dangerous condition of the deteriorating highway between Smithton and Marrawah is a huge priority for both the Circular Head community and council and has been the subject of a number of conversations and online commentary. The terrible state of our roads in the north-west and the potholes that are damaging cars and putting lives at risk. I also want to touch on those projects promised but now slashed in the budget or consigned to the farthest reaches of the forward Estimates, the Dial Range Sporting Complex, Wynyard and Rosebury emergency service hubs. These delays and cuts have not gone unnoticed, and voters are not happy.

The Treasurer's goal is to reach peak debt, the point at which annual borrowings stop increasing by the end of the forward Estimates and to begin paying debt down thereafter. I query the honesty or accuracy of this claim when you have GBE debt significantly rising past the forward Estimates, owing to Marinus Link. Whether the Treasurer proposes to reach peak debt in 2028-29 or later is not the point. The point is how he proposes to get there and how credible and sensible those measures are. 

There are several levers the Treasurer can pull, and he should be pulling all of them at once, but, instead of pulling levers, he's reaching for the axe to achieve greater efficiency in the public service. I have no problems with greater efficiency. The public expects an efficient public service, one that delivers real value for money. My concern is why are these programs being funded in the first place or positions being created if there were not objectively measurable benefits in having them in the first place or if they were merely duplicating existing services.

Measures like fiscal efficiency might save money in the short term, but my concern is when cuts to services intended to save money produce greater inefficiency. I suspect there is a link between efficiency dividends and vacancy control, asking staff to do more with less, and the rise in workers compensation claims, particularly the psychological injuries. The Budget papers highlight that workers compensation costs are rising dramatically, driven by increased claims and psychological injury prevalence.

The rising cost of the risk is primarily due to a significant increase in claim payments, weekly benefit costs and the cost of settlements, and the growing proportion and cost of psychological claims, which are eight times more expensive than physical claims. This has prompted an additional funding allocation of $183 million in the 2025-26 Budget to Tasmania's Risk Management Fund and an additional $14.5 million annually for workers compensation claims for police, fire and emergency services.

Treasurer, your own Budget Paper tells a revealing story. Chart 2.3 shows the sector that contributes most to Tasmania's economy, the government and community sector, is responsible for nearly 30 per cent of gross state product. That's more than construction, manufacturing, utilities, agriculture, forestry and fisheries combined. Although most of the service cuts are in the forward Estimates, I want to put on the record several of the cuts that I'm very worried about and that make no sense. 

Halving funding for the community services sector, the very services that keep people out of hospitals, keep food on the table and out of the justice system. The cutting of 25 per cent from the biosecurity budget. How can it cut this service which is already underfunded and at the same time warns of biosecurity risk to agriculture and fisheries and tells us daily how important this sector is to our economy? We have seen the damage caused to the economy from biosecurity breaches, Piscirickettsia salmonis in the salmon industry, mop-top virus in the potato industry. 

Our feral cat situation is out of control, and the previous cat management plan is not even 18 months expired. Feral deer are out of control and there is virtually no funding for invasive weeds. Slashing the budget of the Climate Office in the forward Estimates. Cutting natural values management by 30 per cent, environmental management by 80 per cent and threatened species programs by over 30 per cent, and it's ending the orange-bellied parrot monitoring program. This is complete madness. 

The Treasurer told us proudly that tourism supports one in six Tasmanian jobs; one in three in our regions. I want to see more investment in tourism for this reason. Let's play to our strengths. I want to see more investment into our tourism industry on the north-west. We have such rich, wonderful Aboriginal history around the Circular Head region which needs to be promoted and protected. We have a World Heritage-quality wetlands in Robbins Passage that should be nominated for a Ramsar listing. On our west coast, there are so many hiking opportunities that could be linked together in a similar way to Scotland's West Highland Way. We don't need to build infrastructure. It's largely already there; old disused railway tracks, roads that no one uses. There is so much potential that isn't being grasped.

Tourists don't come here to see salmon pens, our logging coups, our wind farms or our tailing stems. They come for our wild places, our national parks, our clean waters, our World Heritage forests, and our beautiful food. Yet, of the $10 billion we spend on general government services, just one fortieth goes to environmental protection. If jobs and prosperity are the goal, then Treasurer you are starving the goose that lays the golden egg while force-feeding the industries that imperil our environment and our tourism industry. If the Treasurer thinks he will get the budget back into shape by cutting services alone. Then we better get our corflutes ready.

Infrastructure: Treasurer, if you want to cut public servants to pre-COVID levels, why aren't you doing the same to the infrastructure budget? In 2018, infrastructure spending was just over 3 per cent of gross state product. This year it's 6 per cent and it's heading towards 7 per cent, the highest in the nation. Economist Saul Eslake calls it an excessively ambitious infrastructure program. I call it reckless. Because we can't afford it and we know we can't, and the community knows it, too. They see health, housing and education being squeezed while billions are poured into the stadium. As one caller to the ABC Mornings put it last week, why is a tradie working on the stadium more deserving of a job than a public servant working in the health department? And I agree.

Our government-owned businesses weren't meant to be assets. Instead, this year they're burdening us with nearly half a billion dollars of debt. One of them might be trading insolvent and another is likely to ask the government to change the rules so it can borrow beyond the acceptable debt limit to go ahead with the Northwest Transmission Developments.

Here are some of the bailouts that are in the Budget this year in the forward Estimates. Six hundred and nine million in equity for the Macquarie Point Stadium and any overrun will be borrowed; $191 million to TasNetworks for the Northwest Transmission Developments; $75 million to TT-Line with the Budget warning that further funding support may be required; and Marinus Link, which will push total public debt towards $19 billion by 2031-32. According to the whole-of-state business case, this level of debt will threaten Tasmania's credit rating and become worse if the projected returns from Hydro Tasmania do not materialise as expected. Look at what happened this year, Hydro's projected returns have not materialised, yet the government barrels on with this project.

Industry handouts: it's not only our government-owned businesses that are getting bailouts from this government, driving us further into debt. The government also continues a worrying trend of ad hoc bailouts for private industry in the form of concessional loans and grants to King Island Dairy, Nyrstar, and Liberty Bell Bay. These bailouts are rarely included in the budget forward Estimates and there is no transparency on how these investments are assessed, no clear value for money test, and no sign they are delivering long-term sustainability. Yet the money is repeatedly shovelled out the door as soon as it's asked for? Just look at the $20 million loans to Liberty Bell Bay. This must change if the government is serious about budget repair.

If the government insists on using infrastructure spending to stimulate the economy, let's at least build things Tasmanians actually need. Right now, 5300 households are on the Homes Tasmania waiting list. If the government redirected the $1.8 billion stadium funding to public housing, we could build around 6600 homes and end homelessness in Tasmania.

The government could forge ahead with building a new acute hospital in the southern Tasmania or ensure our schools are fit for the 21st century, or invest in King Island port facilities, Grassy and Currie, to accommodate a wider range of vessels, reduce turnaround times and attract more operators. It could commission a feasibility study for livestock processing here in Tasmania, rather than having to send our made off-island to get processed. Instead, this Treasurer prefers measures that drive up house prices and put more money in the pockets of business owners by tripling the first-home owner grant continuing payroll tax rebates, measures Saul Eslake himself has called completely unjustified.

On this auspicious day in the history of the Office of the Governor-General, I can't ignore the $11 million allocation for the Office of the Governor. This is made-up of almost $4 million for capital works and over $6 million in operational costs to support one person. That is double the operational budget of the Integrity Commission and nearly half of the entire budget for the 35-member House of Assembly. To channel Gough Whitlam, well, may we say, God save the Governor-General, but it isn't the Governor-General who needs to start saving. 

On a more serious note, Treasurer, if you are serious about budget repair, you must look at revenue-raising. I'm not talking about GST revenue. I'm talking about things you have control over. I'm talking about state revenue In 2025-26, state taxation will bring in nearly $2 billion, up by $111 million from last year. This is almost 20 per cent of our revenue. However, there's still scope to make the system fairer and more sustainable. Economists, including Mr Eslake, have been crystal clear: close loopholes like payroll tax exemptions and the first-home buyer grant; broaden the land tax base and phase out stamp duty; properly tax the gambling industry for the harm it is causing in our community; charge fair resource royalties, especially from the salmon industry, which contributes far less than it should, and also the mining industry.

Treasurer, I was also interested to read in the Budget papers that marine farm lease fees bring in just $1.6 million. Now you put that into context and what that industry is turning over, it's in the billions. We're not getting our fair share there. That is less than half of what the abalone industry pays, which was 20 times smaller than the agriculture sector. That's indefensible. 

I will be raising these ideas through the Treasurer's new budget consultation panel, and see if the panel is actually about collaboration or, as the name suggests, consultation, which is what this government does after it's nearly already made-up its mind.

[5.11 p.m.]
Mr PEARCE (Braddon - Minister for Primary Industries and Water) - Deputy Speaker, it's an honour this afternoon to speak on the appropriation bills. This is a budget, of course, that continues to deliver on our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future. A plan to make Tasmania the best place to live, the best place to work, and the best place to raise a family, the best place to invest and do business right here in this great state. It's a budget that gets the balance right. It invests on the important things, costs of living, in health, in education, in public safety and in housing, and it delivers a sensible pathway to surplus.

Today is Remembrance Day, of course, and every other day the Tasmanian government stand firmly behind our veteran community. As minister, I'm proud that we're recognising in this budget the value that that our veterans bring to our state with more than 17,500 veterans calling Tasmania home. As a veteran myself, I see firsthand how government acknowledges the contributions that veterans make across communities, in its workplaces, families and in civic life. I'm very pleased that Tasmanian government's 25-26 interim Budget delivers a significant increase, in fact a 92 per cent increase in funding for Veterans' Affairs from $623,000 in 24-25 to $1.197 million in 25-26.

How are we going to use that? What are we going to use that for? As you would know, we've now seen the one-year anniversary since the handing down at the Royal Commission into Veterans' Suicide. However, it doesn't end there. There are tales attached to the end of that. How those recommendations plug into communities, special communities. How we can plug veterans and their families into their own communities, will require some state effort, and it will require very considered state effort in order to match the variants, the nuances, the differences in veteran safeness in Hobart and greater Hobart and some veterans who call the west coast of Tasmania or King Island or Flinders maybe their home. The situation's going to be different in all of those regions. My plan is to make sure that we've got measures that takeover from where the Royal Commission recommendations end and that community can take hold of that veteran and their family and make their life more worthwhile. 

I want to see actions, and we've already talked about and built plans around the implementation of recommendations around the, the findings of the Royal Commission. We've talked about an employment strategy and building. Improving on the employment strategy that you see - you see a veteran has a very unique set of skills, knowledge and attitude that makes them extremely valuable when it comes to employing them in a civil workplace. However, it is the articulation and the translation of those skills between the military and the civilian world that's important. I want to work on that. I want to work on that translation process so that the civilian world understands what the military world talks about and vice versa.

I want to put support measures around the veteran's families because when a veteran leaves the big family, that is the military, and moves out into the civilian world, they need their own family because that is the only mechanism that they have to reintegrate into their new futures, a new job, a new future for their children and their spouse. There's work to be done there. Revitalising this veteran employment strategy between 2023-2027 leads to an expansion strategy into GBEs, into businesses and into industry, as well as the public service and other places where those skills that we have from defence can be utilised and put forward to ensure that those other businesses gain from that.

I also want to develop and perfect that employment register so that the veteran's skills match the civilian market. I have talked about that briefly, but it's important that we understand completely, from exiting defence to entering the civilian world, what the training deficits are in terms of compliance and what have you, so that we can ensure that veteran has the very best chance. The 2025-26 funding reflects an important piece of work that is required to support our veteran community.

I am also a proud farmer and, as Primary Industries minister, agriculture, biosecurity and water are extremely important to me. The 2025-26 Budget is delivering for our farmers and the agricultural sector more broadly. Tasmanian farms are the lifeblood of our regional communities, generating jobs, generating exports, and exciting prospects for growth as our reputation for the highest quality produce anywhere in the world continues to rise.

With industry, the Tasmanian government has a target to grow the farm gate value of Tasmanian agriculture to $10 billion by 2050, and we are well on track to meet that target, with our farm gate value rising 5 per cent to $2.46 billion in 2022-23. Tasmania is feeding the nation, producing 11 times more food here than we consume, and it's the very best food that you can get anywhere in the world, grown at the highest standards to the highest tolerances and the amount of tucker that we grow per hectare staggers most mainland farmers. It really does.

It's also the quality and the vertical integration that we put into that agricultural sector that's important, and delivering that agricultural produce to the consumer in the most efficient and freshest possible way; that's another contributing factor to our industry. Equity contributions to the Tasmanian irrigation scheme across 2025-26 Budget and the forward Estimates include $130.1 million in Tasmanian government funding to Tranche Three irrigation projects, which will augment and improve and continue to support our thriving export agricultural sector.

This significant investment includes - this is back to irrigation again - our irrigation investment includes $50.4 million for the state's $75 million commitment to the $300 million Great South-Eastern Irrigation Scheme. The scheme will provide a highly reliable supply of irrigation water to one of the driest parts of the state, turning that into a high production agricultural treasure trove for future exports and future growth.

It will also drive farm investment and unlock equity in a farmer's place. Typically, when we see irrigation being put onto a privately-owned farm, the per-hectare value could about double; that unlocks equity for that farmer to then spend and reinvest and so on and so forth; the economy grows in our ag sector. The 2025-26 interim Budget provides $1.5 million to continue the important Agricultural Research and Development Fund, delivered in partnership with the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture, on top of ongoing core funding. That's an additional $1.5 million to continue that. This funding supports and leverages further investment in world-class research in development and extension so that we can deliver practical on-farm benefits to our state's agricultural food producers.

The Budget includes $440,000 to support the ongoing roll-out of the Water Use Strategy. This funding will ensure that we have good fresh water management information complementing other key projects like developing water strategies for King Island and Flinders Island.

The Budget includes $2.25 million to include delivering the government's Tasmanian Wild Fallow Deer Management Plan 2022-27, which will allow further actions to sustainably manage wild fallow deer populations and get those populations down. This plan includes initiatives to provide more land access for recreational hunting, and to help more effective management of deer numbers.

The Budget also complements the significant investment in agriculture in the 2024-25 budget, which was delivered in September last year; instalments that continue to bear fruit. This includes key areas such as biosecurity, as was recently demonstrated by the management of the potato mop-top virus, and investment to support the continuing growth of sectors such as wine production, which included a $1.5 million injection investment in supporting our peak bodies and agricultural organisations through a successful strategic industry partnership. That included a total of $2.5 million.

Importantly, this budget delivers what we said it would deliver, and that is to get the balance right. We're building a better agricultural sector now and for the future. We're backing economic growth and we're backing our farmers at the same time. Along with these sectors in primary industries, fisheries and aquaculture are key pillars to our regional economies. We are committed to the resource management that ensures the future of our fisheries and continued job security across our fisheries and agricultural sectors. 

We support jobs, we support business and we support industry. This budget provides those who are employed in our world-class fisheries and agricultural sectors with confidence that they continue to work in an industry that is sustainably harvesting and growing the world's best seafood. It builds on the $8.6 million committed in the 2024-25 budget, investing in the seafood sector and the marine science that it supports.

We can drive that delivery further towards our 2030 goal, that $10 billion that I spoke of earlier. Importantly, this budget commits to the $1.3 million of additional funding over the next four years to sustainably manage our Marine Research Collaboration Agreement. This increases our existing annual funding for that commitment to the University of Tasmania Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies of around $3 million over the next four years, benefitting all seafood sectors. 

We're also supporting the development of the Road-Map to Digital Transformation for Tasmania's wild-catch fisheries, and we've allocated funding to support biotoxin sampling across the seafood sector. The Tasmanian seafood industry has a combined gate value of over $1.5 billion. That is the highest value seafood industry of any state or territory in the country.

We want profitable, socially-responsible and ecologically-sustainable fisheries in Tasmania; fisheries that create economic growth and opportunities for Tasmanians. That's why we're continuing to provide funding to support stock enhancement, translocation programs, rebuild fishing stocks and safeguard future programmes across key species such as rock lobster and flathead for our commercial and recreational fishers. 

I'm one of the proudest members for Braddon that you've ever seen. I'm proud to share some of the exciting progress on how our future plans are shaping the north-west, the west coast and King Island. I believe Braddon is the engine room of Tasmania's economy and of in health and mental health, we're delivering the first stage of the North West Hospitals Masterplan, which includes expanded emergency departments. We're also constructing a brand new dedicated mental health precinct in the North West Regional Hospital to replace our Spencer Clinic and establish a new mental health hub in Devonport.

On the west coast, we're upgrading the district hospital to improve access for aged care services and ensuring that our communities receive the care that they deserve close to home without driving to the coast to see a loved one. In education, we're investing in the future of our children. The major redevelopment underway at Montello Primary School is due for completion in 2026. It's great for those kids who go to Montello, with upgrades also planned for Burnie and Havenview primary schools.

A new Child and Family Learning Centre will be delivered in Smithton, and that's important for the Circular Head region. We're building a brand new purpose-built north-west support campus in Devonport. If it's anything like the one we've got in Burnie, it's a lucky place for those kids. It really is. Along with significant upgrades for the Burnie campus that already exists that I talked of earlier.

We're also improving teacher housing to support our educators, and that's important. It's important to consider. 

On the infrastructure front, we're upgrading key transport routes, such as the Bass Highway between Devonport and Launceston, the Ridgley and Stanley highways, and planning for the development to the Cradle Mountain corridor.

We're investing in our communities with a multi-purpose sports centre in Devonport, we're upgrading sporting and community facilities in Penguin, Port Sorell, East Ulverstone, and Valley Road. On King Island, we're delivering a new ambulance station, upgrading teacher housing on the island, and building a new green for the King Island Bowls Club. I had a bit of a bowl on there and it is in need of some capital injection.

On the west coast, we're upgrading the Murchison and Zeehan highways, improving the Rosebery Police Station, and enhancing aged care services at the West Coast District Hospital. These projects represent our commitment to building stronger, healthier, and more connected communities across our region.

I thank the Treasurer, the honourable Eric Abetz, for his work and leadership in pulling this budget together. I've known him for many years. In fact, it was him who encouraged me to get into politics. He has a wise head and a steady hand, and I back him 100 per cent with this plan. This solid plan that that will continue to grow an economy, continue to grow a strong Tasmania, a plan that gets the balance right, the necessary investment into the services Tasmanians need now and with no new increased taxes.

A plan that provides a clear and sensible pathway to surplus with a vision towards the future of our state, and I commend the bills to the House.

[5.28 p.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Deputy Speaker, I rise this evening to talk on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), the Budget. What can I say? This budget is cooked. Alarm bells must be ringing, especially in the Treasury department. It is very frustrating for me to be here every year and go through this same charade where we watch the budget get worse every year. We then have to sit here listening to the Liberals pretend that everything is just fine, budget after budget, as the state's finances go into the toilet.

This budget's figures just simply can't be believed. We have a Treasurer, now Eric Abetz, who has basically taken the budget from May, he has changed the date, he has fudged the figures a little bit so it looks like the budget is actually improving compared to his predecessor, Guy Barnett, who is the first treasurer that I've ever known that hasn't actually delivered a budget. On top of that, the Liberals have ditched their election promises.

There may be people out there in Tasmania who have received a letter from the Premier explaining why they haven't received the election promise that they pitched their vote for. If you have that letter, I remind you to have a chat with the greyhound industry and the salmon industry, which also received a letter from the Premier before the election only to be done over after the election. If you've received a letter from the Premier saying, 'Oh, by the way, your election promise that we promised you and said was going to happen, it's not happening until the next budget,' and you got a letter, I just wouldn't believe it.

But let's have a look at the Budget. As I said in the broadcast on Friday, which you can check out on YouTube if you're interested, you only really have to look at two tables in the Budget to see how bad the situation actually is. All you need to do to start with is go to the very first table in the Budget, which is Table 1.1, which is key fiscal measures. What you can do is look down at what the government budgeted for last year and what was actually spent last year. Now, this is the preliminary outcome. Things might actually be worse because what I understand is they couldn't work out how much money was actually spent last financial because this budget went to the printers before they had the final figure.

What it says is that, on the government's own figures, the budget last year compared to the outcome of the last financial year, they blew it by about $400 million. That meant that, instead of being about $800 million in the red, it turns out it was $1.2 billion in the red, or about $400 million, and now the debt as of 30 June is $5 billion. Tasmania's debt is $5 billion. Considering that when they came into power there was no debt.

Now, I will talk about where they're getting the fudging. We've heard the pathway to surplus, that's what we just heard from the member who has left the Chamber pretending there's a pathway to surplus and this is where the Treasurer really fudged the figures. Now, what we see is the government are going to spend a billion dollars more than what they're actually earning this year, the next year and then you have to really look at the fiscal deficit here, which includes the infrastructure money.

The government can count the money coming in from Canberra, they don't have to count the expenses and so things look better, but the real situation is that this government is spending over a billion dollars more than they're earning this year. They're going to do the same the next financial year and then the following financial year. The 2027-28 forward Estimates, they're saying, it's only going to be half a billion dollars and then it's going to be $152 million in the final year. But if you just look at the operating surplus, which is probably the most glowing and easiest one to fudge, the government are pretending they're going to have $5.6 million in surplus. What they'll go and say to everybody is actually we've got a surplus in 2028-29. What they're trying to pretend is they're going to have more income than expenses in 2028-29. Now, we know that's complete garbage.

I will point out one thing. This is where you just can't hide the debt, and I've been in this place, and I've said it a number of times. One thing about the budget is you just cannot hide the debt. You can put sprinkles on the turd, you can pretend everything's fine, but you can't hide the debt. In the year where this government thinks, or pretends, that they're going to have a surplus of money, they can't really explain why.

If you look at the net debt between the 2027-28 year and the 2028-29 year, the debt is going to go up by $800 million. That's $800 million, and yet they're saying that they're going to have $5.6 million in a surplus. It just doesn't make any sense.

Now, where did they fudge the figures? Where did the Treasurer, Eric Abetz, fudge the figures? You only have to look at the second table that I would recommend everybody who wants to look at the Budget just look at two tables, just look at the final table in Budget Paper No. , which is Table 9.16, which is general government expenses and transactions by purpose. That's when the Budget is actually split up into the different sections, and just have a look at the health section. You look halfway down that table and have a look at health, and you will see that the government budgeted about $3.1 billion in health, but they actually spent $3.5 billion, which is actually an increase of 12 per cent. They blew their budget in the health sector by 12 per cent. Worse outcomes, yes, worse outcomes. They blew their budget by 12 per cent and got worse outcomes. Incredible.

What they will have us believe, is that this year's budget is $3.57 billion and in the last forward Estimate, so in 2028-29, they'll spend $3.7 billion on health, which is just a 4 per cent increase over that period. Now, there is zero chance of that happening. Zero. The reason for that is they have fudged the figures. As I said, they have blown the budget by 12 per cent in one year, and now they're pretending that the budget will only go up 4 per cent in four years. That is a complete joke. If you want to see the other figures that they fudged, just have a look for yourself. In public order and safety, they are going to spend less in four years' time than they did last year. In economic affairs, they're going to spend less than half of what they spent this year in four years' time. This is just nonsense. That is why the figures in the budget cannot be believed.

What does this mean in real life? It means that the debt is going up and up and up every year. As I said, you cannot hide the debt. Just have a look at Saul Eslake's summary of the budget, go to his chart number four, general government net debt, and you will see that debt is climbing year after year. I have been to budget breakfasts, and I heard Michael Ferguson talk about the arc of the javelin when it came to the debt. He put a graph up and the final year of the budget Estimates - so year four of the Estimates - it was just slightly down on the previous year. He was arguing that the javelin is starting to head its way back down, which is complete nonsense. What we actually have is a rocket heading in completely the wrong direction. 

We didn't hear Eric Abetz talk about the arc of the javelin because it's probably come down and got someone in the rear end. What we heard Eric Abetz talk about this year was 'peak debt'. Peak debt is the new - 

The SPEAKER - I remind the member that it's the honourable Treasurer or member for Franklin.

Dr BROAD - The honourable Treasurer was talking about peak debt. Peak debt, like debt is going to peak. There is absolutely no peak in the debt when you look at the charts, it is just a skyrocket into the air. We heard member for Braddon, Mr Pearce, talk about the pathway to surplus. He probably didn't get the memo from the Treasurer that he's supposed to be talking about peak debt, but he's still on the old school of pathway to surplus, but it is not a pathway to surplus, it's a snail trail and debt is just building up. You cannot hide the debt.

What does the debt actually mean? It means that repayments are heading towards $1 billion a year. If you go to Table 3.6 of the budget, total borrowing, including the defined benefit scheme costs, it is $1 billion a year starting from 2027-28. The cost of debt, including the defined benefits superannuation scheme, to the cash receipts is over 10 per cent. In other words, the cost of servicing our debt is getting up to 10 per cent of our income. It is unsustainable.

How unsustainable is it? I will go back to Saul Eslake who said that Tasmania's projected non-financial public sector cash deficits will be larger as a percentage of gross state product than those of any other state or territory. Any other state or territory. How did we get from the point where we had the best books in the country, with zero net debt - 

Mr Shelton - When?

Dr BROAD - In 2014 there was zero net debt and now we have the worst finances in the country - 

Mr Shelton - You can't use superannuation, if you don't consider that you left the debt.

Dr BROAD - The worst finances in the country. We hear from the backbench the talk about the superannuation debt. We know, and we said in this place before that the provision for superannuation was not cash-backed. It was just a book entry.

Mr Shelton - They put $1.5 billion dollars into it.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Dr BROAD - Even if you can run the argument that it's Labor's fault, what have you been doing for 11 years, honourable Mr Shelton?

Mr Shelton - You were the ones who spent the superannuation liability.

Dr BROAD - Eleven years you've been in charge and, apparently, it's our fault. You are talking about $1 billion of superannuation - 

Mr Shelton - You not only spent it, you burnt the barn down.

Dr BROAD - Your debt is $10 billion. Work your figures out. 

What does it actually mean? How do you fix this? The growth in Tasmania's economy has been more dependent on public spending in recent years than any other state or territory, something that cannot continue if the government is going to get serious about budget repair, as Saul Eslake says.

Part of the problem in the state is that the economy has been propped up by government spending. What do you do when the debt is heading to $10 billion? When they pull the plug, people will feel the pain. Saul Eslake also says today's Budget Papers show that the government's fiscal strategy targets are not going to be met. Only two of them are being met, and they are the least demanding of the targets. What is happening with the government's own report card on their own budget?

the state's current credit rating: AA-; their target is AA+ stable: they've failed.

gross debt per capita. They're saying it should be less than $20,000; it's $23,000: fail.

net debt to gross state product. It is supposed to be less than 10 per cent, it's 17.4 per cent: fail.

cost of debt to cash receipts. It is supposed to be less than 7, it's 7.6; fail.

the fiscal balance is supposed to be balanced: it's not. Fail.

total government sector own-source revenue a percentage of total income. They want it to be more than 37 per cent, greater than a third: it's not, it's 30 per cent. Fail.

The last one I find really extraordinary. The impact of state business enterprises and state-owned companies on the general government sector financial position is supposed to be a positive impact, right? The all the businesses that the state owns and controls are supposed to actually put money into the budget. What's happened now? They're taking $421 million out of the budget. That's a massive fail. We just saw this $75 million bailout for TT-Line and there is more to come. That's just a hint of the future.

What else do they have? The general government FTEs per capita saw no increase compared to June 2022. What's happened? It's about 500 per 100,000 people greater. Here they are talking about the public sector, which has grown under their watch, they even failed that test; something that I'm surprised the Treasurer, Eric Abetz, has let go, given his history. The issue here is the number of public servants has grown in Tasmania, but what's happened to our outcomes, what's happened to the services? They got worse. It is just incredible.

All this budget catastrophe has a real-world impact. This budget really lays bare the incompetence of the Liberals under Jeremy Rockliff. I will talk about the real-world impact of this budget. You only have to look at the Tasmanian Risk Management Fund. It requires an extra $183 million in additional funding that is provided in the 2025-26 budget. Why does the Tasmanian Risk Management Fund need extra cash? Because it is basically the state government's insurer for things when things go wrong, including workers compensation.

I will just read this from the budget. This is about the State Risk Management Fund,

The overall increase in contributions for 2025-26 is principally due to an increase in personal injury contributions, specifically workers compensation. This increase is primarily a result of a significant increase in claim payments, particularly during the six months to 31 December 2024, driven by a rise in the injury incidence rate and an increase in the weekly cost benefits, together with a sustained increase in both the incidence and cost of psychological claims. [TBC]

Psychological claims. This means public servants are so stressed they're going out on workers compensation for stress, and it is costing the budget $183 million in additional funding. If that is not an alarm bell, I don't know what is. No wonder public servants have said that they've had enough. No wonder the teachers are talking about stress. No wonder the police are talking about stress. No wonder people in our health system are talking about stress. Here it is in the budget, in black and white. This massive increase in psychological claims for workers compensation. This is an outrage.

This budget lays bare the incompetence of the Liberals under Jeremy Rockliff. What we see is more debt, worse outcomes - particularly in health and education, and a stressed workforce. No wonder the public servants are protesting. No wonder the public servants are on strike. No wonder the public servants want a better deal from this government. They are not listening.

What we've seen also is the Liberals have done a deal with the protesters in this place, the protesters have been elected, and they continue to trash Tasmania's finances and pretend everything is just fine. If Labor had brought down this budget there would be headlines every day for weeks. If Labor had done a deal, sold their soul by hooking up with the protesters in this place, there would be headlines for weeks.

To summarise the Budget: there is no light at the end of the tunnel with this budget. There is a debt train, and it is coming, and it will hit and hurt every Tasmanian.

[5.45 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, first of all, as a former treasurer, I congratulate Treasurer Abetz on his first budget. Members opposite have been sarcastic and uncomplimentary. I remember attending a budget luncheon in, I think, 2006. The first thing I said to the treasurer, MrAird, Labor, was 'Congratulations on your first budget.' A little bit of grace goes a long way, I feel. 

On this day, Remembrance Day, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the service and sacrifice of the many men and women, mostly men, but the many men and women who have served our fine country through decades past, and for whom far too many are not able to return home, more than 100,000 of those servicemen and women. It was an honour this morning, alongside so many members of this House, to attend, on a parliamentary sitting day, the Hobart Cenotaph to mark this day that signalled a form of truce and an ending of hostilities after the Great War, which was the ruination for many families and lives across the world all those years ago.

In speaking to the Budget, I congratulate the Treasurer for his work. I congratulate him, together with the Premier and the Cabinet, for delivering a budget that looks to the future with confidence and purpose and honestly tackles the financial and budget challenges which we all have in front of us and deals with them in a prudent, responsible and properly paced way.

Whatever else today represents - budget debates and people having their say - today was Labor's opportunity to give its response to the Budget. They've had all weekend to work on this response, and the benefit of time with their many more advisers than they have compared to the Greens, and they have not produced an alternative budget. I think this may be now the 12th budget for which the Labor opposition have failed one of their basic responsibilities as an opposition party.

The government, and through Treasurer Abetz, have worked through this challenge, especially given the timeframes involved and brought forward a budget which is balancing our economic, financial and our social responsibilities as managers of not just government services, but the way in which government causes economic activity around our beautiful state. It takes real action on the issues that matter to my families in Bass - the families that I represent in Bass who are caring and concerned for their children's future, to be able to aspire to one day own their own home, to be able to access strong, effective, safe and timely health services, and, of course, to get a quality education, which, as an educator myself, is so important to me, my wife and our family. That education is such a powerful force for good in the world. Often underrated - I note in today's debate, not underrated. It's been acknowledged, I believe, around the Chamber, and that's a very good thing. The Budget addresses these together with, of course, community safety and infrastructure for our community.

I want to note in passing that this budget is out of sequence. It was supposed to have been passed in May or June of this year, and the Budget has been delayed by the actions of people on the other side of this Chamber and a few Independents - some of whom didn't make it back after the election - who moved a no confidence motion in the Premier, and caused an election that was, frankly, a waste of time and money. It did not see Labor crowd surfing to office, as I think they may have imagined they would.

At this juncture, this is my opportunity to acknowledge outgoing member Simon Wood from my party in Bass and outgoing member Rebekah Pentland, not from my party, but an Independent, also in my electorate of Bass. Two very fine people, in particular, Simon, who I'd worked with and appreciated so much as a close friend. I thought he made a great contribution to this House. I hope others will agree. Rebekah Pentland, who started out here as a Jacqui Lambie Network party member, and for reasons of a political implosion in that party, became an Independent. I feel I can say she made a genuine, heartfelt, and significant contribution in just those 14 or 15 months sitting over to my right. I admire both of those people. I miss them very much.

Today, the government is back doing what Tasmanians elected us to do: delivering that responsible forward-looking budget that meets the needs of our communities. In the economic context, the global position is no better than it was one or two years ago. In fact, in many ways I'm delighted with the hope for peace in the Middle East, the hope for some kind of outcome for the Ukrainian people, and, of course, that inflation can continue to be tackled right around the globe. It is sad to see in Australia that we're seeing national inflation ticking in the wrong direction, but our budget setting must be made within that context. If we correct and we achieve budget repair too rapidly, a point I've made in the past, we run the risk of damaging our local economy, as I saw happen when I was sitting over there nearabouts where Dr Broad is and watched the financial purity of that Giddings' government, which led to the catastrophic pollution of our economy as a result of those knee-jerk reactions that caused not just havoc in the health and education systems. Remember, they closed wards, shut down mental health funding, stopped elective surgery, and tried to close 20 schools, nearly all of which were in the regions. Those effects were felt for a long time.

We need to see budget repair. I believe that every Cabinet minister is on record saying that. It needs to be done in the right way, at the right time, and being very prudent with those dollars in the way in which they're spent. It really does beggar belief to hear the Labor Party making really quite shallow criticisms, including of the people, the individual human beings, who have served as treasurer recently. I think that's cruel and unnecessary. I think that the Labor Party might be a bit uncomfortable with its own history here. In just a few years they've had Dr Broad, Mr Willie, Ms Forrest, and Mr Winter as their lineup of shadow treasurers, none of whom have produced an operating statement. Not one of whom has produced an alternative capital investment program. Not one. 

I will say, at the elections where I've served in this government, they've always outspent us. Always. Every single time. It's very hollow, unsatisfying rhetoric that I hear from members opposite the member who just resumed his seat. When they make their emotional criticisms of the Treasurer Abetz and his department's work - the Budget - but they're not able to have the courage of their own convictions to produce an alternative and put a black line through the things that they don't agree with and to add in the things that they believe are higher priorities than what the government might have settled on. No, we're just expected to walk past that and forget it. 

Tomorrow, I believe, the Greens - because they always like to stage-manage for the Wednesday - that's the Greens' day - I totally expect a document that few here may agree with, but nonetheless they will have done the work. They've been doing it over the weekend. Am I wrong or am I right?

Mr Bayley - We've been doing the work, for sure.

Mr FERGUSON - I'm right. The Greens faithfully do it. I think they wear it now as a badge of honour. If the official opposition won't do it, then what the Greens would say - I'm not agreeing with this - 'We're the real opposition, we'll do it.'

Dr Broad - Yes, make up stuff on a spreadsheet. 

Mr Bayley - It is an interim budget, lay off.

Mr FERGUSON - I don't think I'm making up anything, Dr Broad. I believe I'm being more than fair. In the economy, we should not walk past this - 

Dr Broad - I didn't say that, actually. I said they make the stuff up.

The SPEAKER - Order. Through the Chair, please, honourable member for Bass.

Mr FERGUSON - Dr Broad, it is my opportunity to be heard. As I stood in this place and spoke on a no confidence motion that Mr Winter foolishly moved in the Premier in the first week of June, I made the point that business confidence is so hard to build up and so easy to destroy. We saw that happen; business confidence was affected greatly during those uncertain weeks, that couple of months of the lead-up to the election, the election and then the count of the election. I'm delighted with recent reports. The Premier mentioned the NAB Business Confidence Survey which came out today, and who's on top? It's something that should please every member of this House, not just those sitting over here. It should please every MP, in the sense of pride in our state, unity for our state, that Tasmania came out on top. I think that's terrific. Can I get a 'hear, hear'?

Government members - Hear, hear.

Mr FERGUSON - Can I get a few more? 

Mr Abetz - Not from Labor.

Dr Broad - He's inciting interjections.

Mr FERGUSON - I am inciting a 'hear, hear', but I'm not getting one. This is part of the problem of the Labor Party, who want bad news. Yesterday, at about 7.00 p.m., I got a delightful email from the Business Council of Australia, telling me in their regulation report that they gave Tasmania second highest place of the states and territories, just behind South Australia. If I was going to be second to any other state, it would be that beautiful state of South Australia.

Tasmania is doing well, and there were areas for future improvement and growth in that report; terrific. I celebrated that email. I thought that was wonderful. Again, it should please every member of this House, because there are families behind that report. There are future investments that businesses will be making in our state off the back of that belief in Tasmania, its economy and its business environment. There will be lives improved because of that report and what it says. There will be jobs created, apprenticeships offered, leases signed, trucks bought, and fuel purchased. I think that was tremendous and want to hear more about it.

Perhaps one of the gold standard measures is the size of the economy. It's now reached over $40 billion. It's the highest ever. I grew up in this state through the 1980s. I remember the recession that Mr Keating said we had to have. I remember it very well, because that recession was written on my parents' faces when they were paying 18 per cent - not 8 per cent, not 5, not 6, but 18 per cent interest rates, nearly one fifth of the value of the house every year, just to service that mortgage; the interest bill alone. They were hard times for our country back then; but now, unlike us traditionally having a higher unemployment rate than the rest of the country, we here tonight, as the MPs of this House, get to brag that we have the lowest unemployment rate of the country. Again, that should make us all proud; proud of our state and thankful for those businesses in the state that have made those employment decisions. Well might we pat them on the back for those good decisions.

Those decisions often find their home here in this room, because the decisions we make, the rhetoric we offer and the criticism that we freely give can all affect business confidence. That's the warning that I provided before Labor took us blindly into that election that was a waste of time and money.

Before the bell goes, if I've got time, I just want to say that this is a confidence that we must protect. High business confidence means a high ability to make an investment in our state that will lead to employment, economic and social outcomes that will allow families to make their future plans with greater confidence. All of this is a relationship that leads to a higher standard of living for our community.

I want to now turn to health investments. This budget, if anything, undersells its health investment.

Debate adjourned.


ADJOURNMENT

Remembrance Day

[6.00 p.m.]
Mr PEARCE (Braddon - Minister for Veterans' Affairs) - Honourable Speaker, on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month each year, Australia pauses. As a nation, we collectively bow our heads and reflect on the supreme cost, the pain and the sacrifice that paid for that freedom, our security and our sovereignty. Just one day a year.

For the brave men and women who serve, who have served, or indeed are affected by that sacrifice it goes on with defending our nation. These thoughts go on each day, the ceremonies right across the nation. Many speeches talked of the bravery, the loss, the torment that these same young Australians and their sacrifice in defending Australia and its interest. 

I believe deep in my heart of hearts that no words, no speech, much less my own today will even come close to truly articulating the degree of solemn gratitude that is deservant in remembering the lives lost in war or conflict.

Today, to me, is the silence that follows such speeches, and it comes in the power of the silence. The first Armistice Day in 1918 followed the silence to the guns on the Western Front. Silence is over 46,000 young Australians they scattered on that ground on the Western Front, a place described by Charles Bean as being more densely sown with Australian sacrifice than any place on Earth.

On the Gallipoli Peninsula, again there was silence. Silence filled the 8141 young Australians who laid dead on that ground. Silence embraced their first landing there, and ironically, it would be silence that would cover their tactical withdrawal.

Regrettably, war seldom remains silent for long and following the deafening fog in the Second World War, in Tobruk, in the Pacific, in Singapore and New Guinea and in conflicts right across the world, again there was silence. The endless silence is over 27,000 young Australian servicemen and women lying dead. Silence followed in military funerals for more than Australians in Korea and in Malaya and in Borneo.

Young Australian forward scouts moved in silence as they closed to contact in the jungles of Vietnam. These same Diggers knew the silence in the morning. For it is in the morning in the dawn that the danger comes, and every Australian Digger knows that.

In the Gulf, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, more funerals, more sacrifice, more silence. Then East Timor, the Solomon Islands and Bougainville and the Sinai, Somalia, Rwanda, Mogadishu. Again, Australians would be called to keep their silence, but it is in this very silence that the torment and the scars of all remain.

It is in the silence that many, far too many, servicemen and women continue to suffer. Far too many are somehow deafened by the silence. Silence that they endure each day. Many can't bear the silence and sadly, many succumbed to the same silence. Silent, too, are the spouses and the kids, the loved ones that were close to our veterans. They know their loved one is suffering. They know that there's something wrong. They don't know what to do, so they remain silent, and all they get in return is more silence.

Today, to every last Tasmanian, when the 11th hour comes, when the haunting sound of the Last Post beckons the silence. I urge us all to truly pause and reflect on the sacrifice and the torment of war, and to truly listen to the silence.


Remembrance Day

[6.04 p.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) - Homnourable Speaker, on this Remembrance Day, on a hill at the northernmost border with the Brighton township lies a little church, Saint Mark's, built from iconic Brighton sandstone. It has a particularly fascinating history for another time.

It stands sentinel, welcoming visitors into the municipality alongside its twin on the other side of the road, the equally iconic Crown Inn, better known as the iconic Pontville Pub. At the front of this little church, amidst the graves, stands a small bell tower, three or four metres high, made of wooden cross members. It's white, though badly in need of paint, and is slowly being consumed by climbing ivy, fittingly another floral choice for enduring remembrance. 

On top of the small tower sits a small illuminated cross. This is the illuminated memorial to those who paid the ultimate price during World War I. Built in the late 1950s, it has since fallen to neglect and despair, but stand it still does and remember we still do. This is not a grand memorial. The honour board inside the church lists just 52 names. Well known to the area, they represent some of the founding families of the community. It is a small honour roll with a carved eucalypt blossom over the top. Listed are the Gunns, the Saliers, Eddington, McShane, Giad, Rathbone and more families at the Brighton parish who paid the ultimate price for God, King and Empire. They are all remembered in our street names, in memorial awards at rural shows and in their descendants who are still prominent members of the community to this day, they are not forgotten. 

Just down the road at the old Brighton Barracks, you will find a bigger memorial, all sandstone and bronze, and it's there that most now remember our fallen. Up on the hill, there's a little bell tower, long unrung, unlit and in need of care, where a quiet remembrance lives. 

They shall not grow old, age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning, we will remember them. Lest we forget. 


Answer to Question - Huntington's Australia Funding

[6.06 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, very briefly in answer to the member for Braddon, Mr Garland, the minister for Health provides this information. I can confirm the 2025-26 Budget does include an extension of the current funding for Huntington's Australia, who have been notified after the Budget was handed down last Thursday.


Remembrance Day

[6.07 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight as Greens spokesperson for Veterans Affairs to also offer my reflections on another Remembrance Day. I offer our thanks to all who have served and pay our respects to those who fell either on the battlefield or through personal battles that follow veterans home. That respect extends to servicemen and women not yet deployed but undergoing real-world training that comes at some significant risk. This risk was highlighted just weeks ago with the vehicle roll over that claimed life of a soldier and seriously injured several more.

This year's Remembrance Day marks 107 years since the guns fell silent in the First World I, the war to end all wars. We lament that that was not the case. Remembrance Day now celebrates the service of those Australians who served in the all too many theatres of war that have followed. World War II, the Korea war, Milan emergency, the Indonesian confrontation, the Vietnam War, peacekeeping operations, the Iraq wars and Afghanistan. May that be the end. With the compassionate words of the Governor, Her Excellency reminded us that horrific wars go on around the globe: in Gaza and the broader region, Yemen, Ukraine, Sudan and Myanmar amongst others. The death and suffering continues.

As we commemorate and celebrate our veterans and their families, we also recognise the innocent victims of war: the women, children and civilians caught in crossfire, deliberately targeted or starving and suffering at the hands of war criminals, megalomaniacs wielding rape as a weapon of war. Orchestrating famine, targeting energy and transport facilities and forcibly displacing people through the systematic targeting of residential and medical infrastructure. War is a shocking indictment on the human species, and many humans act shockingly in war. The willingness and ability of those men and women who step into uniform and defend the values of this country with bravery and integrity is admirable. 

How profoundly those veterans stood this morning at the Cenotaph, medals on the chest, families in attendance. Each one has a million stories to tell of their experience and what has been changed by them, for better or for worse. Not all want to speak of their experience, but creating the opportunity to support veterans is imperative. A big part of that is providing the supported safe spaces for veterans to share their experiences, fears, hopes and fragilities, and most importantly seek help and support.

The Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide highlighted shocking failures in the system in supporting veterans when they return home. It recommended the establishment of a new agency to support veterans' wellbeing and to assist ADF members transition back to civilian life after service. At the community level, the RSL Veteran Hub connects a network of multidisciplinary teams with veterans to assist with health, mental health, housing, justice, employment and income and financial support.

The charity Mates4Mates offers mental health and well-being services, physical rehab and social connections to help veterans avoid the lonely spiral of mental anguish. One only wonders how long past veterans survive the process of integration to society from the horrors of war without these kinds of options available. Many did poorly, I'm sure. For me, my grandfathers never really spoke of their experiences serving out of Darwin in the Second World War, nor, as far as I'm aware, did they get any formal support. They were both magnificent men in my early life, and I learnt much from them.

I thank RSL Tasmania for another successful and meaningful ceremony at the Cenotaph, Australia's oldest state War Memorial. Spring on the Cenotaph certainly turned it on for us. Sun shifted to rain, as the wreath laying commenced turning to brilliant sunshine again on conclusion. Irrespective of the weather, the location of the Cenotaph is deliberately chosen for prominence and view down the river, down which departing World War One soldiers sailed, was on show. As we move into significant debate and vote on an issue that will impact on the Cenotaph, I hope all attending members had the opportunity to experience the reverential ambience of the Cenotaph, its prominent setting and the significance it represents to the RSL, its members and their families.

To finish, while we stand in solidarity with veterans and honour their service on Remembrance Day and every other day of commemoration, I stress that we Greens stand for peace, non-violence and justice for all. Lest we forget the horrors of war and those who endured it.


Remembrance Day

[6.11 p.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I'd like to speak on this Adjournment about Remembrance Day. Today is Remembrance Day, when on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, the guns in Europe fell silent, ending World War One. 

Forty-six-thousand soldiers died on the Western Front. Tonight I will talk about one of those soldiers who never came home. That was David Allen Broad; no surprise that he was a relative of mine, my great grandfather's brother, who was much loved. I will talk about the circumstances, and the National Archives are a fantastic resource when it comes to researching any soldier in just about any field of war. David Allen Broad signed up and was with the 40th Battalion and he reinforced the 42nd Battalion in the Battle of Messines.

Messines is in Flanders, Belgium. It's quite a famous battle, when on 8 June,1917, 19 bombs that had been planted in tunnels underneath German command posts exploded. Those explosions were absolutely enormous, and there was a battle, the front line moved significantly forward for the first time in a long time. My great uncle was part of that battle. On 10 June, while on a clean-up operation, he was shot and killed by a sniper. I just think about that, what a waste. It wasn't in the main battle, it was in the clean-up operation a few days after the main battle, he was shot and killed. We certainly got that first-hand from somebody who was there at the time.

There's also a personal connection because my grandfather, David Broad, was named after him. My great-grandmother was pregnant at the time, when they got the news that David Allen Broad had been killed in action. It brings home the significance of it, every time that I lay a wreath at the War Memorial in Devonport, because his name is up on that memorial. Today, he is buried at Bethlehem Farm, which is just near the village of Messines.

Also during Remembrance Day, I reflect on my sister Carrie Anne, who had a long career in the Air Force and she served as a peacekeeper in Sudan, and she came home. Her husband, Chris, who served in Iraq came home. Thankfully, he did, and we don't have a story about an unfortunate incident in war with my sister or her husband, but I think it is just on days like this that we do need to reflect on what has happened in the past so that it doesn't happen in the future. Lest we forget.


Jenkins Hire - Water Licence Variation in Derwent Valley

[6.15 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise this evening to raise concerns from the community in the Derwent Valley. There has recently been a water license variation application from Mr Jenkins of Jenkins Hire to take an additional 500 megalitres, bringing his total licence to 799 megalitres from 299 megalitres. This application is currently under assessment. This is a community who have faced a series of issues relating to terrible odour, river pollution and more. They are deeply concerned why there is a need to take additional water and, most pressingly, what it will be used for.

We only need to cast our minds back to 2020, when the proponents of the water licence variation caused two major environmental incidents on the Plenty River. Eleven breaches under the Environmental Management and Pollution Act 1994 resulting in a major fish death of over 100,000 brown trout, 12,000 rainbow trout, 43 brook trout, and 23 display fish at the nearby salmon ponds.

Since that fish kill, the EPA has issued two more breach notices. In 2022, for the stockpile of liquid controlled waste and biomass that were not correctly widowed, resulting in 19 odour complaints, some from 1.5 kilometres away. The other notice issued was to stop land spreading organic waste on areas that slope towards the Plenty River. The volume of 500 megalitres has been requested from the River Derwent, where 98.6 per cent of the surety five water availability limit has already been allocated.

The Tasmanian Water Assessment Tool indicates that only 3070 megalitres is potentially still available. That 500 megalitres, for an unknown use, is a significant portion of what's left, should it be approved. I say the water is for an unknown use because the water allocation is listed broadly for 'irrigation'. According to the department, it has been intended to fill a so far unapproved, unpermitted dam that may or may not already exist, and the concerns from the community are extremely valid over the risk of what a future dam with this amount of water may be used for considering both devastating 2020 events which came from uncontrolled spills in makeshift dams holding hazardous waste.

Perhaps the water is for the previously proposed and then withdrawn feed lot. Proposed intensive farming - is the water to grow silage on site for the feed lot? The community do not know and, fairly, they don't have confidence in the current land management for this case, given the past devastation that's been caused. It should really be on the proponent to exercise transparency and open communication with the community if he is to regrow trust, and for the people who live nearby to have confidence in any new propositions, because while these actions are happening on one person's land, the serious and negative implications are for the whole community.

When considering past events, ongoing odour issues, limited water allocation remaining and the lack of river monitoring in the Derwent and, indeed, across the entire state, here we have the best 'worst case' example of why we desperately need to establish statutory water management plans overseen by water catchment authorities right across Tasmania. In other parts of Australia, water catchment authorities are already the norm, established for the sole purpose of protecting and managing rivers. Victoria has ten catchment management authorities, and Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia all have regional bodies dedicated to river health.

Tasmania is an outlier, and nowhere would the case for action be stronger than on the Derwent. Last term, the Greens tabled a petition on behalf of Safe Water Hobart, who I acknowledge are here with us today, to set up a Derwent water catchment authority and the government has fallen short. Even funding for the Rural Water Use Strategy stops after this year in the forward Estimates in the draft budget before us.

The State of the Environment Report 2024 was clear in recommendation 14: Tasmania needs investment into monitoring our river's health. We should have an annual State of the Water report, and the commission recommended, as a priority, that Tasmania work towards broader water resource policy approach that addresses resource allocation, water security and quality.

Statutory water management plans coordinated by water catchment authorities that oversee the catchment to the coast can assist on all fronts. Water is literally our life source and in the climate crisis, properly funded programs will be the crucial lifelines for many communities. We must see governments of all levels come to the table for water security, quality and management as a matter of urgency.


Lifeline Tasmania

[6.20 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight on the Adjournment to talk about the amazing work of Lifeline Tasmania. I met recently a couple of times with Liz Brown, the newish CEO, and she was able to share with me the amazing work of Lifeline. Lifeline in Tasmania has been around for slightly over 50 years. It is a not-for-profit which focuses on crisis support, suicide prevention and the broader mental health and wellbeing services across Tasmania. We're all very familiar with the lifeline number, 13 11 14, which provides support to those people in need of assistance.

Lifeline offers a range of services and programs. It's not just the phoneline; there are workshops for workplaces, training in relation to preventing vicarious trauma, trauma-informed organisations and support for people after a suicide event, social support services including for older people who are isolated and resources for families and carers. 

A particular issue I want to raise tonight on the Adjournment is regarding the specific Tasmanian telephone support service they call the Tasmanian Lifeline, which is offering non-judgmental telephone support for Tasmanians in experiencing non-crisis distress, for example, loneliness, anxiety and isolation. This state-specific service helps reach people before situations escalate to crisis. It contributes prevention and to early intervention. It was established around the time of COVID to support thousands of Tasmanians in their moment of need. This is a service which is efficient, economical and provides that prevention which we all talk about. Many people refer to the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. This is literally building a fence at the top of the cliff to stop people getting to such a dire set of circumstances.

In terms of A Tasmanian Lifeline, the numbers are pretty clear. Of the callers to the lifeline, 96.5 per cent experienced emotional and social distress, 80.6 per cent were women, 72.5 per cent were aged under 26 or over 65 supporting vulnerable aged people, 57 per cent identified as being from a low-socio-economic background, and 72 per cent reported a disability, while 30.7 per cent of callers were directed to A Tasmanian Lifeline by a health professional. It's clearly valued by health professionals. It does amazing work, and their ongoing funding is a matter of debate in this budgetary process. 

We all as a House, acknowledge the amazing work of the paid and unpaid workers at A Tasmanian Lifeline supporting Tasmanians across the depth and breadth of our state. In every corner and every nook and cranny, and this A Tasmanian Lifeline, is a unique service which I think is an exemplar in preventative health.

I would call on all members to support it. When you're next meeting with the Treasurer, put it on the table, slip it across and say: 'Don't ever forget A Tasmanian Lifeline'. I want to support the work of and acknowledge the work of Liz and her team.


Gough Whitlam - 50 Year Anniversary of Dismissal

[6.23 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I'm grateful for the opportunity to have a short time on the Adjournment tonight. I do want to recognise that today, 11 November, marks another anniversary, that is 50 years this year since the dismissal of the Whitlam Government. Members would be very aware that Gough Whitlam became Leader of the Opposition in 1967 and then led the great Australian Labor Party to victory in 1972, ending 23 years of Liberal-National Coalition government.

Gough Whitlam was a giant of our party and a giant of our country, and we still benefit so significantly from some of the reforms that he made in just three short years. I remember him being interviewed towards the end of his life and the journalist asked him, 'Isn't it a shame that you didn't govern for longer?' He said, 'Actually, I got most of my list done in those three years.'

I wanted to share a small list of some of the enormous achievements that Gough Whitlam and his government made in the 1970s. He established Medibank, of course, which went on to become Medicare, the universal healthcare for Australians. He abolished university fees and made university free with the entryway for thousands of women who would not otherwise have been able to access higher education. He advanced women's rights, creating an office for women and appointed Elizabeth Reid as the Women's Adviser to the Prime Minister. That was a first in the world at that time. Of course, now we're very familiar with there being ministers for women, but back then having an adviser to the Prime Minister advising him specifically on women's rights was a very new thing in the world.

He introduced the Supporting Mother's Benefit, the first pension for single mothers. He ended Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War and abolished military conscription, an important thing to reflect on, on Remembrance Day as well. He also advanced human rights. He enacted Australia's first federal legislation on human rights, including the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, which endures today, and passed Australia's first environment legislation, establishing the Office of the Environment. He abolished the death penalty for federal crimes. He advanced arts and culture funding. Importantly, he historically recognised Aboriginal land rights, formally giving back land to the Gurindji people with the symbolic act of pouring a handful of sand through the hands of elder Vincent Lingiari. That famous image went on to become the core theme of that Australian anthem, From Little Things Big Things Grow, by the living legend Paul Kelly.

Gough Whitlam's government stood for public health and education, human rights, and women's rights, and rapid progressive social reform that we still benefit from today across Australia. I know that there are members of the Labor Party gathering right across the country tonight to recognise that it is 50 years since the dismissal of that incredible government. There are members at the Hobart Workers Club in Hobart tonight and if the Adjournment finishes soon enough, I will go and join. I pay tribute to the many members of the Australian Labor Party who continue to maintain the rage and legacy of Gough Whitlam.


Tourism Industry

[6.27 p.m.]
Ms HOWLETT (Lyons - Minister for Tourism, Hospitality and Events) - Honourable Speaker, I rise this evening to speak about Tasmania's visitor economy and to thank the many businesses for the hard work that they do every day to make it such a valuable part of our overall economy. As Minister for Tourism, Hospitality and Events, I was thrilled to recently attend the 2025 Tasmanian Tourism Awards Gala, the 2025 Hospitality Tasmania Awards for Excellence, and the 2025 Visit Northern Tasmania's Champions of Tourism awards.

I am very grateful for the industry leaders who worked hard to deliver these fantastic celebrations of our industry, giving our businesses the recognition that they deserve. Thank you to Amy Hills, the CEO of Tourism Industry Council Tasmania; Steve Old, the CEO of Hospitality Tasmania; and Tracey Mallett, the CEO of Visit Northern Tasmania, and their teams. These events gave us the opportunity to celebrate our amazing tourism and hospitality professionals. The hard-working businesses who are the cornerstone of our visitor economy, our wonderful lifestyle, and our global Tasmanian brand.

At the Hospitality Tasmania Awards, I was so proud to present the Premier's Award for Contribution to the Community to James and Andrea Johns from Great Lake Hotel. I also presented the Hospitality Minister's Award for Contribution to the Industry to renowned chef Paul Foreman. At the Tourism Awards, it was my pleasure to announce a Tourism Minister's Young Achiever Award for 2025 to Sophia Tsamassiros, the founder of Eudaimonia Tasmanian Cycling Tours.

These Tasmanians epitomise the spirit of our state's tourism and hospitality industry operators. Since taking on the portfolio for Tourism, Hospitality and Events, I have had the privilege of meeting many of these operators right across our wonderful state. Behind every visitor experience is an incredible amount of hard work that often goes unseen that I want to publicly acknowledge here in this place. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=16.8_D=18.8_C=0.84]  Every smiling face, every perfectly timed tour, every tidy room or beautiful meal, these don't just happen by chance. They are a result of long days, late nights and a deep commitment to giving visitors the very best of what our state has to offer.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=36.4_D=14.6_C=0.83] We know that tourism and hospitality aren't just about attractions, they are about people and the hard work and heart of our operators and business owners who turn up to work  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=51.1_D=4.4_C=0.79] every day and turn Tasmania into an unforgettable experience. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=56.3_D=13.0_C=0.90]  I want to put on the record my sincere thanks to all of our tourism and hospitality operators and the work that they continue to do.


Salmon Industry - Florfenicol Usage

[6.30 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, when recreational fishers and coastal communities heard the news that multinational salmon companies had been given the green light in Tasmania to use the antibiotic florfenicol in public waters, they were outraged. After last summer when tonnes of diseased and ranked dead salmon and fat-balls spewed onto people's beaches, and there were gallons of the antibiotic oxytetracycline travelling around the Huon and Channel from [Bookmark: Phr7_O=100.3_D=28.2_C=0.82]  the diseased fish pens that were being treated, people expected change.

The Premier said he was putting the industry on notice and people assumed that meant the government would finally do their job of protecting the marine environment. That would look like fixing their weak regulations that currently allow fish farm companies to destroy wildlife, including dolphins and cormorants and seals and all the rest of the marine diversity in our [Bookmark: Phr8_O=129.9_D=2.1_C=0.31]  waterways and bays that have been trashed. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=132.8_D=28.2_C=0.82]  That hasn't happened. Instead, recreational fishers have been told that they shouldn't fish within 3 kilometres of any lease site that is being treated for at least 21 days after antibiotic feed is tipped into salmon pens.

The problem is there are so many pens across southern Tasmanian waterways and the Huon and Tassal companies have been using antibiotics [Bookmark: Phr10_O=162.0_D=1.8_C=0.63]  for so long. Recreational fishers [Bookmark: Phr11_O=164.2_D=14.0_C=0.86]  are reasonably asking where in the southern waters will it be safe to fish this summer, and who would know when and where it would be safe because there is no real-time information to tell people where the no-go fishing zones are. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=178.5_D=14.0_C=0.74]  Florfenicol has never been tested for use in Tasmania, but from what the science says, we are shocked that the Liberals are lauding the Chilean salmon industry as best practice for antibiotic use. The truth couldn't be more different.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=192.8_D=28.5_C=0.75] The science of florfenicol impacts on the marine environment explains why the Chilean industry has an infamous reputation for being the world's worst aquaculture practice. Under the heavy hand of big salmon, corruption within the Chilean government is rife, laws have been written to allow cowboy practices and prioritise the maximum profits for companies. The chemical composition of water and sediment around salmon pens in Patagonia is now unrecognisable. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=221.6_D=25.4_C=0.80]  What were biodiverse channels are now barrens and the cost for the coastal communities has been extreme. Their way of life has been destroyed. The indigenous Kawésqar in Chile's south-west now have industrialised waterways and have lost their fishing resources. 

The feedlot conditions and warming waters of Chile have caused numerous mass mortality events in recent years. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=247.5_D=2.8_C=0.46]  Piscirickettsia salmonis has been responsible for [Bookmark: Phr16_O=250.9_D=29.7_C=0.77]  50-100 per cent of those mortality events. So how does the industry deal with this problem? Not by destocking or reducing the population of salmon to sustainable levels, but by dumping 300 tonnes of florfenicol every year into the fjords and channels of Chile. One researcher studying the use of florfenicol there said it's badly abused in the production of salmonids. Another said P. salmonis is 'without doubt becoming increasingly resistant to [Bookmark: Phr17_O=280.7_D=24.3_C=0.81]  important frontline antimicrobial classes with severe implications for the future treatment of infectious human and animal diseases.' 

To be clear, salmon companies in Tasmania and Chile are not using florfenicol to treat salmonis disease in fish. It is not about giving a sick animal medicine so it can live a long and happy life. It's about pump-priming the fish to make sure that they can stay alive for long enough to be shipped to the market for maximum profits. The Liberals are setting us up to follow in Chile's steps, and after what we saw last summer and no change in practices since then, we are deeply concerned at the way they've fast tracked the approval of florfenicol in Tasmania.

The risk of antimicrobial resistance is significant globally as an environmental and human threat, and we're disturbed at the Director of Public Health warning on 7 November when he said:

While there is no evidence of harm to human health from consuming traces of florfenicol, recreational fishers may choose to avoid exposure to antibiotic residues in the fish that they catch and eat. [TBC]

Communities are very concerned they could be unknowingly exposed to residues of antibiotics not prescribed by a doctor from eating wild-caught fish, especially in the Huon and Channel because they have no idea of whether they're they can safely fish or not. People want to know whether it is safe to catch fish for the Christmas lunch, and they want real-time disclosure as the Huon Valley Council mayor has suggested.

Remembrance Day

[6.35 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Honourable Speaker, tonight I'd like to pay tribute to the 17,500 veterans and ex-service personnel who have served this great state of Tasmania and Australia and all members of the Australian Defence Force on this special day, Remembrance Day, we remember them. Australia paused at 11 AM on to mark the Armistice in 1918 to mark the end of World War One.

Four-year long conflicts today to honour the courage, service and sacrifice of all our veterans and ex-service personnel, the 1.5 million Aussies who've served this country since that time and before and to remember the 103,000 Australians who made the ultimate sacrifice during that time. They gave their lives. They gave their today for our tomorrow.

I pay a tribute to Her Excellency the Governor, Barbara Baker, who gave a most beautiful address today in Hobart at the Cenotaph to mark Remembrance Day and reflected on some of her family connections in past conflicts. Likewise, to the RSL Tasmania for organising this event and indeed various commemorative events all around Tasmania today. Thank you to RSL Tasmania.

Mike Gallagher, the president, who's so ably leading the organisation to Chaplain Ben Johnson today and the catapult party was fantastic. Indeed, the Australian Army Band and Melanie Brown just provided a wonderful support to all those that were in attendance. Of course, there were some 15,000 Tasmanians who served in World War One, an estimated 3,000 who gave the ultimate sacrifice, and we remember them all.

Many in this place have connections to wars, past conflicts, peacekeeping operations and I acknowledge again the honourable Gavin Pearce, as I did earlier today for some 20-years of service served in East Timor for this great nation, so thank you Gavin. Of course, my own grandfather served in World War One Royal Flying Corps, flew a biplane and survived, and my uncle was three-and-a-half years as a prisoner of war in the Second World War, under the Japanese in Singapore and on the Thai-Burma Railway.

But today is also a special day because I've had the opportunity of joining with Rob Fairs, MP member for Bass Together with Teddy Sheean VC's nephew Gary Ivory and his brother Kevin, who were in the Chamber today but were able to present on behalf of the Sheean family, a replica VC medal and other special remembrance items and books, including my book on Tasmania's Victoria Cross recipients as well, for the MACq 01 Hotel in Hobart, a special room is dedicated to Teddy Sheean VC.

It was so good to be there to be able to mark the memory of Teddy Sheean VC. Of course, he gave up his life on 1 December 1942 and he had an opportunity, like the rest of his shipmates, to flee to safety.  He went back from the side of the ship, he was able bodied at the time, went back to the Oerlikon anti-aircraft gun, strapped himself in, took down one plane, damaged another. He was there to protect his mates and to protect and save Australia. He gave up his life for us and for our sake. That act of courage and sacrifice will never be forgotten. 

I pay a tribute to Garry Ivory for some 32 years of campaigning to ensure justice for Teddy. I have that sticker on my cabinet at home, 'Justice for Teddy'. Well, we got justice for Teddy, it took 78 years, 32 years from Gary, 17 years from myself, but all the Sheean family, RSL members all around Australia and especially in Tasmania. Garry, thank you for your service to recognise the bravery and sacrifice of Teddy Sheean. It was this day 12 months ago that Garry, myself, the Chief of Navy, and the Latrobe Mayor unveiled the statue of Teddy Sheean in Latrobe, his hometown on the northwest coast of Tasmania. A very special day. Today we also say thank you to Teddy Sheean for your courage, service and sacrifice. 


Tasmanian Chapter of the Islamophobia Register

[6.41 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I thank those members who have made reference to Remembrance Day and also to Ms Haddad for the reference to the dismissal. Those are both really important contributions to our enduring freedoms that we remember.

I rise this evening to speak about an important event I attended on Friday evening at Moonah, the launch of the Tasmanian chapter of the Islamophobia Register. The evening was hosted by Eamon Jaffrey who I recognise in the Speakers Reserve and her husband Ali and other members of the Muslim community. There was a wide variety of others who were there to show support, including the acting Anti-Discrimination Commissioner, Pia Saturno; CEO of the Migrant Resource Centre Tasmania, Gillian Long; and Chair of TasTAFE, Mr Tim Gardner. Over good food from Spice on Wheels and frank discussion, we heard the importance of the register and had a chance to think deeply about not only the impacts on the Muslim community, but what we can do to stamp out racism in Tasmania. I was honoured to meet guest speaker for the evening and Executive Director of the Islamophobia Register, powerhouse Dr Nora Amath, who told us of the register's impacts and successes in mainland states.

It is a national initiative which was which has been going for about 10 years, launched in 2014 by Afghan-Australian lawyer and writer Mariam Veiszadeh, who was the founding chair. It encourages Muslims to report instances of racism, the idea being that the more of these instances we collate, the better we can be about calling out racism and ensuring Muslim people feel safe in Australia. Registering complaints with the Anti-Discrimination Commission is also important to capture. 

Why is this register needed? Since its inception in 2014, the register has reported nearly 1000 incidents of racism in mainland Australia, worked with countless policymakers, community leaders and governments across the political spectrum, and published four research reports that document instances of Islamophobia in Australia.

I have read parts of these reports, especially the recent one published between 2023-2024, and have to say the stories documented are heartbreaking. Everyone should have the right to stay safe and to feel like they belong in this country. On Friday, similar experiences were relayed by local Tasmanian Muslims, where women have had their hijabs removed on buses, or racist remarks or physical attacks have been made on the street. That makes people feel unsafe and it makes people feel very scared. One of the things that disturbed me most when reading the recent report was the idea that racism is on the rise. One-in-three Australians have a negative view of Muslims, a figure up 7 per cent from 2023. As a comparison, this is nearly three times higher than negative views towards Jewish people, that should not be tolerated either. I would like to recognise the work done, particularly to combat anti-Palestinian racism with the devastating war in Gaza and the political and societal tensions manifested in Australia. 

Many Australians are in denial about the impact Islamophobia has on Muslim people. In 2024, a poll showed that only 9 per cent of Australians believe Islamophobia was on the rise. We know that in Tasmania there is a greater number of people who are Muslims. That number has doubled since 2016 in the census to nearly 5000 people in 2021. The research reports say, 'Look, racism is a problem, it is documented, there is evidence', so that we can recognise patterns and those patterns tell the truth about what is happening and where in Australia, and now, with the opening of this chapter, in Tasmania.

We are in a time in history where tolerance, I fear, is diminishing. We see an erosion of tolerance, acceptance and respect that I know impacts our Muslim brothers and sisters, as with many communities. It is through action, legislation, speaking up and calling out poor behaviour that we can overcome this. Thank you to those who've worked hard on the Islamophobia Register.

Remembrance Day

[6.47 p.m.]
Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for Arts and Heritage) - Honourable Speaker, I've been thinking how to make a contribution that is meaningful for Remembrance Day. I have recently been back to my old College in Melbourne, Ormond College, as I was delighted to accept an offer to be made a fellow. Ormond College is the College of Weary Dunlop, who was an incredible man - that was a World War II story - and Robert Menzies, also an incredible person.

At that college, I attended Melbourne University and studied history and classics, my first degree. I was very interested in the stories of the ancient worlds, but as I learnt more about Australia and Australian history, particularly the story of Australians at war, I learned about the Battle of Beersheba. It was considered the last great mounted cavalry charge. The connection is that in Tasmania we have Light Horse, and, in speaking with our Light Horse here, they tell me that Tasmanians were there for that charge, and they were lookouts on the hill. I studied this many, many years ago, and my recollection was a little bit hazy, so I've revisited it recently. 

History is so important for all of us to understand what has happened before and what will happen in the future; to recognise that peace is where we want to end up, but that we do need to engage in defence as well. So, Melbourne University Light Horse Regiment was engaged in those battles, and my grandfather Colonel Victor Northam, much later in the history of the world, was in charge of the 16th Punjab Regiment, which was a Sikh regiment, based in Lahore, and he was there during the Gandhi era and the decolonisation of India.

He and his family, a second generation Raj family, stayed on after partition, and were asked to manage partition, which was a very bloody and very difficult series of events. They migrated to Tasmania after that, after the Tasmanian government - which may well have been some of my relatives on the other side - invited retiring British Army officers to move to Tasmania, and they were granted access, I think, to buy farms and lands in the north of the state at a lower rate. 

I would like to just note all of that. That's sort of a little bit of background about why I'm interested in this particular story. I have visited the battleground. I was fortunate to visit there before all the recent troubles in the Middle East, and just reading the gravestones of the young Australians and British fellows, many of whom have brought their horses from their farms on ships to the war, we're just heartbreaking. I can't imagine what it would be like as a mother to send your son off, perhaps from a farm in Tasmania or elsewhere, with his favourite horse and for them not to return. 

I just thought I'd very quickly lay a little bit on the record about the charge of the 4th Australian Light Horse at Beersheba, late in the afternoon of 31 October 1917. It is remembered as the last great cavalry charge and its renowned for people reflecting on it and saying that these boys did it because they didn't know it couldn't be done. It was quite remarkable. Infantry divisions of the British Corps were attacking from the south, artillery fire, infantry attacks as well and the ANZAC mounted division's attack from the east had succeeded in capturing Beersheba by mid-afternoon. With time running out for the Australians to capture Beersheba and its wells - which were very important, obviously, the horses were parched also - Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel, the Australian commander of the Desert Mounted Corps, ordered Brigadier General William Grant, commanding the 4th Light Horse Brigade, to make a mounted attack directly towards the town, and he knew from aerial photographs that the Turkish trenches in front of the town were not protected by barbed wire.

The boys did it, they used their bayonets as swords. Nobody had seen anything like it. They were used purely as a cavalry for the first time. They were not equipped with sabres. I just feel the sense that resonates down through the ages of these incredible young Australian and British men working together and what they did that day goes down through the ages. 

There's my little connection and recollection for Remembrance Day, I think. The tears I shed at that battlefield, because it's hard not to acknowledge that, were very real.

Remembrance Day

[6.51 p.m.]
Mr VERMEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I'd like to rise to congratulate the community of Taroona and the wonderful event that they put on today for Remembrance Day. I've been to a few of those events and ANZAC Days as well, and the spirit that they have down there is truly alive. The young people there, the Cubs, the Scouts, the Taroona primary and senior school as well have all been well involved. The tennis club, the fire brigade. It has such a great spirit. 

It was led by Martin Potter, and we started the event outside like everyone on quite a reasonable morning. As the clouds gathered and the rain started coming through it was going through the procedures and a couple of the young children there were just going through the motions, and you could sense that everyone wanted to move inside. It was coming down pretty heavy and we had elderly people there as well. As soon as that part was done, we moved inside and proceeded further, but we were reminded there by Mr Martin Potter that soldiers don't go inside when it's raining. They're out there on the field enduring the conditions that are at hand. 

Those in forests et cetera can't have the luxury of putting on a rain jacket for that may give away, by the sounds of the drops of rain, their positions, and those on the front in that Great War were in the mud, which had members of their comrades and foes obliterated and mixed in that mud and water. It is a quick reminder that we've ducked inside to get out of the rain, but there's a lot that never had that opportunity and don't and still stand there for us.

I'd like to say thanks to Charlie Jones, who helped facilitate a great event, Chris Harris, Kyle Wood, piper James McAlpine, Ronald Claxton for his passionate read of the Ode and the chaplain David Lewis for his words as well. It's a great community, a small community. It's a community that embraced my family. My grandfather and his wife and children all came out from Holland after the war, in 1950, to seek a better life. They moved to Sandy Bay, but eventually they went to Taroona, opened a business there, and I still have cousins and family members living in the community at Taroona, and they've been great at being embraced. The Taroona RSL does a fantastic job, the community in general does a terrific job and I'd just like to give some praise to that small community that is wedged in between Sandy Bay and Kingston, but who get on with the job.

They do not ask for much, but they are very proud and it's a pleasure to be there and represent the parliament there. I would also like to say that the honourable Mr Wilkie presented a flag as well from parliament. I think it was around about 20 years old, so that a flag they have in Parliament House in Canberra - they try to move them around communities and this is quite a nice large flag that was presented to the community down there as well. 

Again, a privilege and I think they are doing outstanding jobs, so thank you.

The House adjourned at 6.55 p.m.
