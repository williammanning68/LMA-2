SPECIAL INTEREST MATTERS

Burnie Musical Society Production - Come from Away

[12.05 p.m.]
Ms FORREST (Murchison) - Mr President, on 11 September 2001, the small town of Gander, Newfoundland, home to about 10,000 people, welcomed nearly 7000 unexpected visitors when 38 planes were diverted to its airport after US airspace was closed. Overnight the town's population nearly doubled. The people of Gander and surrounding communities opened their schools, churches, community halls and homes to care for these stranded travellers, offering food, clothing and, most importantly, kindness. This extraordinary response reflected the simple Newfoundland saying, 'We give what we have'.

This is this true story that was recently brought to life through the Burnie Musical Society's production Come from Away. The Burnie Musical Society put on a wonderful, class performance of this heartwarming musical, a performance as good as the original cast, which I actually saw in New York. They skilfully took the audience on the rollercoaster of laughter, deep sadness, great love and friendships with a collection of characters thrown together by fate.

The Burnie Musical Society President, Niamh Baily[OK], in welcoming audiences, wrote:

At its heart, this remarkable story is about compassion, resilience, the extraordinary power of community. When the world was grounded on September 11 2001, the people of Gander opened their homes and hearts to thousands of unexpected arrivals. They show that in times of fear and turbulence, kindness and connection can help us soar again.

That spirit resonates deeply within the north-west. The Burnie Musical Society is a small amateur company with strong roots in our community. For over 60 years, it has worked to support, celebrate and nurture talent from across our region, bringing world-class musicals to local audiences and giving everyone the chance to experience the power of live theatre.

Director Tash Turner's[OK] journey to this show was particularly moving. She describes how she first encountered Come from Away, saying she immediately brought out the Broadway soundtrack, and sat in awe for the next 90 minutes. Tash said she laughed, cried and was deeply moved by this story of generosity, empathy and camaraderie between strangers who quickly became like family. 

This production brought together a broad range of community members, including some who had never been on the stage before. That's what community theatre does. It creates opportunities, builds confidence and brings people together in the pursuit of something meaningful. However, I must acknowledge that this production has been marked by profound sadness. The Burnie Musical Society community recently lost one of their own, Seth Crane[OK], a cherished member of the of their Come from Away cast. As the BMS shared:

He was a cherished part of our Come from Away cast and the Tasmanian theatre community - always bringing warmth, laughter and light to every moment we spent with him. His presence will be deeply missed by everyone.

My condolences go to Seth's family and friends, and to all the Burnie Musical Society cast and crew grieving this tragic loss. I urge any anyone feeling in need of support to reach out for help. There are people and services to assist, such as Lifeline on 13 11 14.

In today's world, the message from Come from Away remains vital. This production asks us to consider what we can learn from Gander's experience. In the words shared with audiences:

As a community, may we take the lessons from Come from Away with us to welcome the stranger, to practise generosity without hesitation, to offer compassion in times of need, and to build connection even in the face of fear. Let us continue to pay it forward with kindness, so the spirit of Gander lives on here on the north-west coast.

For regional and remote communities like ours, the arts play an especially powerful role. Local arts initiatives combat social isolation, support cultural heritage and support opportunities for young people to develop confidence and skills. They help ensure that people living outside major cities are included in Australia's cultural life, fostering connection, opportunity and pride across diverse and geographically dispersed communities. Theatre brings people together in a way few other activities can. As the president noted, theatre is never a solo flight; it soars when it's shared.

The people of Gander showed us that ordinary people, when faced with extraordinary circumstances, are capable of remarkable compassion. They gave what they had. They welcomed strangers. They built community in the midst of crisis.

I thank and acknowledge the Burnie Musical Society and all those who helped make this truly remarkable performance one to remember. This includes all the volunteers who build sets, make costumes, the musicians who rehearse for months, the performers who pour their hearts into their performance on stage, the families who support them all, and the audiences who gather to share the experience.

Mr President, may we give what we have and contingently by those words, and thank you to the Burnie Musical Society.


Trevallyn Bowls and Community Clubs

[12.10 p.m.]
Ms PALMER (Rosevears - Minister for Children and Youth) - Mr President, there were many lessons that came out of COVID. For me, one of those really powerful lessons was about connection and care that we see through our community clubs. These are the organisations that know who is who in the community. They know who to call in a drama, and they know who will put their hand up to help. They also know who's missing in action or who might need a little extra care at any time.

Today I would like to share about one such community club - the Trevallyn Bowls and Community Club. Trevallyn has always, and will always be, a very special place for me. It holds my happiest childhood memories. It's where I went to primary school, and where I learnt to ride my bike up and down all the hills. We played in the street, we never took a drink bottle anywhere and we certainly didn't have mobile phones. We spent our time playing in each other's homes, drinking out of a hose, if we needed to, and playing in the scrub near the gorge. 

The bowls club sits in the heart of Trevallyn. It's right across the road from the primary school. It sits behind the Max Fry hall, next to the tennis courts and the cricket and Little Athletics oval. The land was gifted to the council by the family of William Barnes, with just one condition - that it be used for sporting purposes. This passionate club has beautiful greens that are very well cared for, and a very proud and connected membership.

In 2005, I'm told that Trevallyn led the way in Tasmania by becoming one of the first clubs to unify its membership, welcoming women as full members rather than associates.

It's worked hard over the years to be proactive in gaining grants and in its fundraising efforts, which have resulted in a great club house, inclusive facilities, outdoor areas and a new commercial kitchen.

In 2024, it was brilliant to see the installation of a synthetic all-weather green. This was made possible by an Active Tasmania grant together with 15 years of fundraising effort, and indeed, it was a huge effort by all. As you know, having great facilities is only one part of a club's strength. It's the people who bring the culture, care and character to a club.

To say there's no age barrier in bowls is an understatement. Currently at Trevallyn, our Men's Singles Champion is 74-year-old Geoffrey Buchanan[OK]. Our current Ladies Singles Champion is 23-year-old Logyn Curtis[OK]. Let me tell you, Logyn certainly brings the character to this club. The best way to describe Logyn is a glamorous pocket rocket. Her resumé reads, rather impressively:

Club Singles Champion, two years running
Club Pairs Champion, four years running
2020 State Junior Singles Champion
Silver medals at the Australian Nationals Under-18s, fours and triples.

The list goes on. Logyn has been part of Trevallyn Bowls Club for nearly six years and she's certainly playing her part to see the club go from strength to strength. She's passionate about seeing younger players getting involved as she has seen the exceptional benefits of being part of a community and feeling connected. 

Her love of bowling came when she first picked up a bowl with her pop, and she's never looked back. Indeed, one of her life goals - although you might expect it to be a list of things she'd like to win - is actually just to make her pop proud. She lost her pop four years ago, but that is still her number-one goal, and I'm sure that he would be.

The Trevallyn Bowls and Community Club is so much more than just a sporting venue. It's a place for connection. For many, it's a second home, especially for those in our community who may have lost a significant partner. The way it honours its life members, the social activities all year round and the way it's so inclusive of others. In fact, just recently the club welcomed a group of pétanque players, which is the French version of bocce. This group of women didn't have a home, as such, so the club made room for them and now they are part of the family. 

I'm very proud of this club and I'm very proud of the group of people who make up the membership. My congratulations go to club president Stephen McElwee and his wonderful team of volunteers.


MOTION

Noting - Budget Papers 2025-26 and Appropriation Bills (No. 1 and No. 2)

Continued from 6 November 2025 (page 19).

Ms RATTRAY (McIntyre - Leader for the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, there will be a couple of parts to this contribution today, because I will deliver the response on behalf of the government in this place, and I will also deliver a separate contribution on behalf of the member for McIntyre.

Mr PRESIDENT - Yes, under the one standing.

Ms RATTRAY - I rise to speak in support of the 2025-26 State Budget, a budget that is both responsible and forward-looking, a budget that recognises the challenges before us but continues to deliver the services that Tasmanians rely on in Health, Education and law and order. This Budget is anchored in optimism, but it is not naive. It balances ambition with clear recognition of the challenges that lay before us, and a responsible government requires both. The Treasurer has made clear that the task is to safeguard Tasmania's long-term financial stability while continuing to deliver the services our fellow Tasmanians depend on.

Tasmania's economy remains strong. On a positive note, our unemployment rate is the lowest in the nation, and more Tasmanians are in work today than ever before. Over 51,000 additional Tasmanians have found jobs in the past decade. This Budget continues to deliver significant investment where it counts most. 

In Health, $14.5 billion over four years: an increase of 12 per cent compared to the 2024-25 Budget, which includes additional funding of $915 million to meet growing demand for health and mental health services, new diagnostic breast imaging clinics and, importantly, a sustained commitment to reducing elective surgery wait times.

In Education, $9.9 billion over four years: an increase of 5 per cent compared to the 2024-25 Budget, with new investment in schools, child and family learning centres and support for more than 8600 students with disability. These investments are not only in facilities, but in the future capability of our young people. 

In public safety, new funding for protective equipment, firefighting and emergency services infrastructure, and programs to reduce reoffending and to support youth justice reform.

Across our economy, strong support for small business, for apprentices and trainees, for primary producers and exporters and for the industries that drive regional Tasmania.

I also highlight the government's continuing commitment to infrastructure, with $3.4 billion over four years, including record investment in roads, bridges, hospitals, schools and housing.

The Macquarie Point multipurpose stadium stands as one of the most significant projects in a generation, with federal and AFL support. It will create thousands of jobs during construction and hundreds more on an ongoing basis - while giving Tasmania a national platform it has long earned. This is a project that speaks to confidence - confidence in our state, our people and our potential. These are essential investments that support Tasmanians day to day, build capacity for tomorrow and speak to the optimism that the Treasurer outlined. The Treasurer also laid the foundation to future budget and fiscal sustainability and did not shy away from the challenge that lies ahead. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=33.8_D=29.6_C=0.81]  

The Treasurer has set out a responsible path, one that prioritises the protection of essential services while driving efficiency across the public sector. The new Efficiency and Productivity Unit will be central to this work, helping agencies identify duplication, streamline programs and achieve better results for every taxpayer dollar. The government's fiscal objective is clear: to restore balance to the budget [Bookmark: Phr3_O=63.5_D=16.2_C=0.87]  and to begin reducing debt over the medium term. That means ensuring expenditure is sustainable, the public sector efficient and resources directed to where they matter most. This approach is not about austerity [Bookmark: Phr4_O=79.8_D=16.6_C=0.85] ; it's about accountability. It's about respect for the Tasmanian taxpayer and confidence in the value of public service. 

The government's goal for the May 2026-27 Budget is to reach peak debt by the end of the forward Estimates [Bookmark: Phr5_O=96.6_D=24.8_C=0.84]  and return to surplus by 2028-29. These are ambitious but achievable targets. They are vital if we are to maintain confidence in Tasmania's economy and ensure the sustainability of services. None of this will be easy. Governments across the nation face the same fiscal conundrum [Bookmark: Phr6_O=122.2_D=5.4_C=0.70] s: rising costs in health, increased wage pressures and the ongoing effect of a tight labour market [Bookmark: Phr7_O=128.0_D=24.8_C=0.80] ; add to this the consequences of global uncertainty, higher interest rates and inflation. The expiry of the 'no worse off' guarantee in 2029-30 presents a genuine risk to Tasmania's revenue base and the government has committed to continuing to advocate vigorously to protect Tasmania's share.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=154.3_D=23.6_C=0.83] Finally, I commend the Treasurer's decision to bring forward the Fiscal Sustainability Report to February 2026. This will allow parliament and the public to engage openly and early on the state's long-term financial trajectory, reinforcing transparency and accountability at every step. 

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=179.0_D=4.4_C=0.93] This Budget reflects what good government should be: practical, [Bookmark: Phr10_O=183.8_D=13.7_C=0.83]  responsible and optimistic. This is about strong finances, strong services, strong communities and strong families. That completes the government's response.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=199.3_D=2.2_C=0.80] The member for McIntyre has arrived. 

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=207.5_D=29.2_C=0.85] I started at the beginning with the Budget overview, and I thought I'd just pick out some of the numbers, and I've touched on some of those in the government's contribution around health and education. Health increased by 12 per cent to $14.5 billion and education increased by 5 per cent to $9.9 billion, and public order and safety has increased by 9 per cent to $3.9 billion.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=237.6_D=19.0_C=0.83] A significant investment has also been made in recreation, culture and religion, increasing by 28 per cent; housing and community amenities increased by 21 per cent; general public services increasing by 13 per cent [Bookmark: Phr14_O=258.9_D=8.5_C=0.83] ; and environmental protection by 11 per cent, which I think is pleasing for a lot of people [Bookmark: Phr15_O=267.6_D=29.1_C=0.83] . Reading from the Budget, 'To ensure long-term sustainability, the 2025 Budget continues the application of efficiency and productivity measures from previous budgets,' but not shying away from the fact that there is a lot of work to do. 

I'm going to talk about some of the matters relating directly to the electorate of McIntyre, and one of the biggest issues that I [Bookmark: Phr16_O=296.7_D=0.2_C=0.31]  receive [Bookmark: Phr17_O=297.4_D=7.6_C=0.78]  through my time out in the electorate or through contact into the electorate office is around reliable and affordable telecommunications for all residents; not only in the member for McIntyre's electorate, but also residents across the state. You only have to travel a bit on our road network to see the challenges that that presents, and particularly in the McIntyre electorate where we're not able to access mobile phone service, and certainly not able to rely on a service that providers deliver and that important connectivity. 

I instance something from last week, where one of my communities, Blumont-Nabowla area, which is not far out of Scottsdale - I'm not good on the kilometre length, but I think maybe about 10 to 12 kilometres - it takes me about seven minutes to get there when I leave the office. They were a week without their mobile phone service. Luckily, they went into Launceston on the Wednesday and were able to make some calls on the Wednesday.

I acknowledge that that was due to upgrading the service, but does it take a week to upgrade a telecommunication service? Obviously, it did; but that's a long time to be without that mobile connectivity. I asked the person who made contact, 'Were you able to use your landline?' She said, 'Look, we've been long finished with our landline. We don't use our landline anymore.' I think that goes for a lot of households.

Ms Forrest - It's a cost you don't need to bear, isn't it?

Ms RATTRAY - Exactly. That monthly cost, plus your calls as well. Why would you, when you have, supposedly, connectivity through a mobile service? Again, obviously that's not just a state issue, but I know that the state has in the past been part of upgrading telecommunications. It happened with my Cressy community about two to three years ago now, where there was a significant upgrade, and Telstra certainly put in quite a bit of that funding. 

They managed to get some federal funding and the state provided some funding. That's one of those areas where a lot of people might be working on their own. It's a farming community; they work on their own and they need to be connected. I will continue to home in on that point. It's really important for not only my electorate, but certainly for the broader Tasmanian electorate.

I fully support the retaining of the current health services that are available in my communities across McIntyre and, more importantly, to expand some of those services - for reliable and consistent access to GP services. Three of my largest centres are served by the same medical practice: these are St Helens and the surrounding towns in the Break O'Day local government area; Scottsdale and the north-east community; and Deloraine and those living in the Meander Valley area.

Wait times to see a GP vary from days to weeks. To see the same GP is near impossible. I expect that this is possibly similar for other areas across the state as well. Accessing that sought-after continuity with a GP is very difficult and continues to be a challenge for many of my constituents. The expansion to the pharmacist scope of practice to treat common conditions should be a positive initiative for our communities, given the access to GP services that they're already experiencing, it can only be of benefit for those people who need to see a GP but can go to their pharmacist and receive at least some treatment for various conditions that they might be experiencing. I believe that could well be expanded into the future, which again is only a positive in my view. 

Timely and accessible ambulance services continue to be high on the list of concerns for the community, and I note there are two new ambulance stations: one for Longford, a really big growing area at Longford, and for Bicheno, which will also serve parts of my east coast community. Sadly, I no longer have the township of Bicheno in the McIntyre electorate; I relinquished that, but I'm still here, and so is the member for Prosser.

Also, just to make a point about how important those ambulance services are, particularly when we have a lack of access to GPs and some of those health services, but that's why utilising our rural hospitals is really important. When people transfer from the major hospitals and then still require some care, I know there's some scope to expand the opportunities to head back to their hometown or a homebase at the very least, and not be at the Royal Hobart Hospital or at the Launceston General Hospital. They can go back to their communities. The St Helens Hospital would be one; head back to the east coast and be able to have family and friends come and visit more readily in that situation where you are still needing some care, but not at the absolute highest level.

One of the issues that I found when I've questioned why we don't utilise these regional hospitals more is that there are not enough permanent staff. Well, let's make that staffing ratio better, higher, so that those people can come back to their communities. I know in the North Eastern Soldiers Memorial Hospital, that's where people want to be when they're convalescing, possibly after an operation or perhaps recovering from a heart attack or some medical condition where they still need some care. Let's not just make these regional hospitals palliative care beds, which are really important, but let's make it that they can also have people who are recovering as well because, as we know, with palliative care there's very little chance of recovery.

I am interested to have some further information around the Efficiency and Productivity Unit that's to be established. I believe in everyone's interest it would be good to know what is envisaged to be the cost of that and how that might function. That's a question to which I expect someone, somewhere who is listening will have an answer. I can re-ask it to myself at a later time if I need to. 

Mr Harriss - You can answer it yourself. 

Ms RATTRAY - I can't answer it myself or otherwise I wouldn't be asking it here, but it is important to have these things upfront. I know there's a bit of a chuckle around the Chamber, Mr President. We're in a whole new world, apparently, so here I am living part of it. 

The no new taxes: nobody wants to hear about possible new taxes. The question is, how can the spend continue without more revenue? I'm sure that question will be asked a number of times over the course of the budget reply speeches. What does additional revenue look like in the future? Is it new business? Is it more Tasmanians working, when we already have that significant increase in Tasmanians who are working?

The question is often asked: are they being underemployed? Is it a three-day-a-week position and they would prefer a five-day-a-week position? Those numbers don't flesh that out, and I believe that would also be an opportunity to find out whether they are full-time positions or part-time positions, or part of a full-time position. 

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=13.1_D=27.2_C=0.81] It went on to talk about the unemployment rate, which is already at a record low for our state, so how much more employment is offered, and it talked about moving from underemployment through casual and part-time, to full time work, and more opportunities for our state through more visitors to our state. So much potential: how is the potential harnessed for a positive future [Bookmark: Phr3_O=41.0_D=2.5_C=0.76]  for our state?

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=44.2_D=28.4_C=0.87] While I was looking through our budget papers and, like most, thinking how can this be turned around and in the most efficient and effective way possible, I thought about the fact that perhaps there is time to look at some increases in levies. As I said, nobody wants new taxes, but are there some industries that could possibly bear some increase [Bookmark: Phr5_O=73.5_D=0.1_C=0.94]  in [Bookmark: Phr6_O=74.3_D=14.7_C=0.86]  those levy opportunities? I instance one, which could possibly well be the most topical one that we have going around the state at the moment, which is the salmon industry. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=90.0_D=15.6_C=0.84]  I don't know whether it is comparable with some other states when it is a whole-of-state resource, if you like, but we need to look at some of those opportunities as well.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=107.6_D=27.3_C=0.81] Easing the cost-of-living pressures: that is always welcomed, the assisting of all households across McIntyre, and I expect it will be appreciated by all Tasmanian households. I note that there's still a number of subsidies that the government provides for those who are doing it a bit harder than others, and I particularly [Bookmark: Phr9_O=135.9_D=1.1_C=0.79]  instance the [Bookmark: Phr10_O=137.9_D=29.4_C=0.85]  rate relief that the government contributes to, and the electricity subsidies, the heating subsidy. We know how much appreciated they are, but also all of these things affect the Budget.

Making housing more affordable and accessible: I acknowledge the stamp duty exemption for first home buyers, and  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=167.4_D=23.0_C=0.83] certainly the funds to assist first home builders, and that's a significant part of trying to give people a hand up to get into home ownership. We established in this place a number of years ago the Homes Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr12_O=192.2_D=1.7_C=0.79]  body.

Ms O'Connor - Big mistake.

Ms RATTRAY -  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=198.1_D=5.3_C=0.86] The honourable member for Hobart has a view on that, obviously, and [Bookmark: Phr14_O=204.5_D=3.0_C=0.92]  I haven't seen [Bookmark: Phr15_O=210.3_D=2.6_C=0.93]  the results that I was  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=213.6_D=19.8_C=0.85] expecting, and I know that there are partnerships with other organisations attempting to deliver homes. I instance an example in the town where my office is, in Scottsdale, and there are three lovely units and they've been sitting. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=234.7_D=8.2_C=0.78]  I consider that they look like they're finished, and the people who are in the walking group said they had looked through the window and they're ready to move into, so I trust them. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=243.8_D=9.5_C=0.90]  They said they're ready to move into, and they have been building those three units for about four years. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=254.0_D=25.1_C=0.89]  

How does it take four years to build three two-bedroom units on the one block of land? There's a mighty amount of cement around them, not a blade of grass to be seen, but that may well be a feature of that accommodation; but we need to get people into these homes, so what's the problem? I don't understand, and when I reach out [Bookmark: Phr20_O=280.6_D=3.1_C=0.81] , sometimes I don't even get a response from t [Bookmark: Phr21_O=284.0_D=10.4_C=0.76] he CEO of Homes Tasmania; it's handballed onto somebody else, so excuse after excuse, and it's not good enough. [Bookmark: Phr22_O=295.6_D=9.4_C=0.84]  I expect that the price and the cost of those homes have probably skyrocketed because it's taken so long. So that's just one instance. 

Also, the turnover of homes that are still in public ownership when tenants move out and work needs to be done. I know that sometimes there's a considerable amount of work to be done on properties, but surely there is a contract in place where a maintenance company does that and they have to do it in a timely manner. Here we have homes that could well suit people, families even, and we continue to wait and wait and wait to see them be able to welcome those families.

In the contribution from the government, I already talked about more child and family centres. I know that they are a welcome addition to any community. They certainly assist with the development and education of our young people, so I support that program and I feel that it is being well supported by not only this government, but previous governments as well, in establishing those. 

Our volunteers across our state are integral to keeping us ticking over. Service clubs, community services, community vehicle drivers, Meals on Wheels, our hospital auxiliary members, our sporting club supporters who carry out all those important roles - trainers, coaches, timekeepers, goal umpires, kiosk workers, and the list goes on. I want to give them a shout-out because our communities would be much poorer without these amazing people carrying out all these roles. When an organisation receives funding, the benefits are significantly multiplied right across an organisation, and in turn to the community to which they belong. It is important to continue to support those. 

It's no secret that I have suggested the Tasmanian Community Fund get back to some of its core principles and start funding some of those small infrastructure programs that need and support so much of our communities. I've expressed that personally to the organisation, that they perhaps not focus so much on programs that are three years long. What happens to them in the third year? Where does the funding come from after that? In the past there was a high focus on small infrastructure projects, and they meant a lot to a lot of communities. I would like to see that come back and be some of their focus again.

The successful Ticket to Play $100 vouchers available for young people to help with sporting fees have been extended, and $100 Ticket to Wellness vouchers have been added, which keep our older Tasmanians active and engaged with sporting and recreation activities. I was recently at the bowls opening at Cressy. I am co-patron of that bowls club. I'm still not very good at bowls, but I'm doing my best to turn up and have a go. These vouchers were the topic: 'When are the vouchers going to be available again?' I know that they're very welcome and are well supported. The first iteration was gone in no time, but the honourable minister, Mr Duigan, might be able to give us an update on that, but they certainly are very welcome. 

Whatever support the government provides for neighbourhood and community houses, they do a great job just in the doors being open, providing somewhere for people to go. I know the fridge at the Dorset Community House is always full, and people are always popping in to find some produce that might help with the family meal prep for that night - really important. Deloraine House does a fantastic job, so does Meander House - an offshoot of Deloraine. 

I note that there was some additional funding for the Legislative Council, for additional electorate office staff. That's been a commitment [Bookmark: Phr2_O=16.1_D=8.8_C=0.86] , and I know that all members received an email from the Clerk of this place providing some options on what  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=26.7_D=5.3_C=0.80] members might use going forward. I look forward to the opportunity to [Bookmark: Phr4_O=32.8_D=9.2_C=0.84]  participate in that as well. I did note, if you don't need it, don't use it. Leave it there. That's good advice.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=43.5_D=3.6_C=0.89] There's also some funding for the change management [Bookmark: Phr6_O=48.9_D=10.9_C=0.80]  support to undertake a structural redesign of Legislative General to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of support services to members of parliament. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=61.4_D=19.1_C=0.75]  We'll wait and see what that delivers. It's one-off funding that I can see, and it will be interesting to see what that does in the future. 

The $3.3 million across the forward Estimates for the digital transformation [Bookmark: Phr8_O=80.7_D=7.9_C=0.65]  program to modernise, digitise, improve and secure the provision of information and communication [Bookmark: Phr9_O=89.5_D=14.2_C=0.89]  services. I've talked about the value of that communication, and certainly in the digital technology space it's really important for how everyone [Bookmark: Phr10_O=103.8_D=18.2_C=0.85]  in this day and age goes about their work. 

With some of those allocations, the parliament's been fairly fortunate, given the financial climate we're in. Let's hope that the benefits that come back to the parliament and to members and the way they do their jobs are well-founded with those opportunities.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=135.3_D=18.5_C=0.87] I can't sit down without talking about the slow-moving vehicle turnouts, and I'm pleased that the minister for Infrastructure is in the House listening. We still only have two [Bookmark: Phr13_O=155.1_D=1.3_C=0.50]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=158.3_D=9.9_C=0.83]  slow-vehicle turnouts on the Tasman Highway from Launceston through to the start of the Great Eastern Drive [Bookmark: Phr15_O=168.9_D=16.8_C=0.77] , pretty much post St Helens, past Dianas Basin, past Scamander and past there. I will continue to advocate, because they are such a valuable tool when you are driving those roads.

Ms O'Connor - How many people would use them? Do you get a bit frustrated sometimes?

Ms RATTRAY -  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=187.4_D=0.6_C=0.61]  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=190.2_D=9.3_C=0.75] I'd like to get frustrated, because they only have two, so it's pretty hard to get frustrated when there's only two, and they're both in the north-east.

Ms O'Connor - Same with the Tasman Peninsula. Very few, if only people would use them when they're there. 

Ms RATTRAY - Perhaps there's some education required. I might be able to give them some advice on when to pull over, and don't speed up when I'm trying to get past you. It's not how it's done.

Mr PRESIDENT - Caravans leave a gap, that's another thing I've noticed. 

Ms RATTRAY - Yes, Mr President, they are really valuable. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=226.6_D=2.4_C=0.84]  I can't say the same for the two stopping bays [Bookmark: Phr20_O=229.5_D=25.8_C=0.79]  on the Sideling. I will continue to say that's not what the Public Works Committee was presented with. I'm absolutely certain that the committee agreed to two slow-moving vehicle turnouts, not two stopping bays. Anyway, they ran out of road, so instead of having one decent one we have [Bookmark: Phr21_O=256.1_D=0.8_C=0.64]  two short stopping bays [Bookmark: Phr22_O=258.5_D=11.4_C=0.89] . 

If we could continue to roll out that program - and I acknowledge that there are plenty of roads in our state [Bookmark: Phr23_O=270.7_D=14.8_C=0.86]  that need a lot of money, and I dare not try to antagonise anyone from the north-west here now, but pretty good roads that way. 

Ms Forrest - You haven't driven on them recently. 

Ms RATTRAY - I have driven on them  [Bookmark: Phr24_O=287.8_D=12.0_C=0.76] very recently and I'm still envious. Every time I do it, I'm envious. 

Ms Forrest - Have you been out to Marrawah?

Ms RATTRAY - I haven't been to Marrawah. I take that back. 

Ms Webb - The last bit to be gold-plated at some point, no doubt.

 [Bookmark: Phr25_O=300.6_D=3.1_C=0.54] Ms RATTRAY - I couldn't sit down and not bring that to the attention of the honourable minister and the government. It is a really important program that we continue to need to work on. I know exactly where the next two need to be, and all they have to do is just give me the go-ahead and I'll organise it.

The Budget does acknowledge the financial challenge ahead, and in doing so recognises our community's needs and expectation and certainly the needs of those services. I'm happy to say that it's an improvement on what we had last time, which I felt didn't really acknowledge the issues at hand. That's where I sit as the member for McIntyre. There is always more to do. I expect that it's on the radar of each and every person to see what we can, as Tasmanians, do as well towards the future of our state.

Mr President, I note the Budget papers.

[12.51 p.m.]
Ms PALMER (Rosevears - Minister for Education) - Mr President, I'm pleased to have the opportunity to speak about our 2025-26 interim Budget.

As the Treasurer and the Premier have already stated, this is a fiscally responsible budget which continues to deliver the services that Tasmanians expect and deserve. This Budget continues to progress a number of key priorities and services across my portfolio areas, and I will use this opportunity to highlight a few of those.

As Minister for Education, this is a budget that places education at the centre of our vision for a stronger, fairer Tasmania. Since becoming Minister for Education last year, I've made over 120 visits to schools and child and family learning centres around the state. This Budget is building a better education system for Tasmanian children now and into the future. We understand that education is the single most powerful driver of social and economic opportunity. A strong education system delivers better jobs, healthier communities, safer streets and a more prosperous state.

This Budget delivers record investment in Tasmanian education for our nearly 57,000 learners from kindergarten to year 12 and our education portfolio workforce of over 11,000 Tasmanians. More than $2 billion will be spent next year alone for this portfolio, with the investment delivering for our schools, our students, our teachers and our libraries across Tasmania.

We are lifting literacy rates, supporting students with disability and upgrading school infrastructure in every region. We heard loud and clear through the Independent Review of Education in Tasmania that our lifting literacy strategy is working. Through this Budget, we are backing our schools to continue on this transformative journey by providing an additional $12 million to supercharge literacy resources. These resources include: 

all schools' relief or additional hours being funded so that teachers, teacher assistants and support staff can undertake training in structured, evidence-based literacy instruction.

resources to support the delivery of a UFLI Foundations and Word Origins in prep to year 8 classrooms, to support structured and explicit teaching.

direct school resource allocations for consumables.

subscriptions to Ochre resources to support English curriculum instruction from years 3-8.

class sets of books aligned with the Ochre resources. 

class sets of texts and a full suite of instructional materials to support delivery of the English curriculum. 

more decodable readers for prep through to year 2.

class sets of texts and access to instructional materials, including lesson plans and assessment tasks.

reducing workload and supporting teaching, and 

the assessment of the English curriculum from prep through to year 10.

Whilst we are seeing gains in literacy, we know we must do better for Tasmanian learners. We heard that message loud and clear from the independent review. The recommendations provide a road map forward which we are developing now. Education Together: Transforming Learning through Collaboration will outline a vision for how we will improve our education system together over the next five years. It's more than just a title: it's the approach that will define our work as a community of educators, leaders, families and partners united by a shared vision.

Education Together recognises that the best results come when we learn from each other, when we share expertise and adopt the best ideas from around the world while supporting our teachers and school leaders to focus on what matters most to them: students, learning and wellbeing. Our Education Together approach includes the trial of multi-school organisations and the development of groupings for schools. These structures create more opportunities for collaboration, allow schools to draw on shared strengths and provide additional support, while each school retains its own identity and school spirit.

We are continuing to provide support for our growing cohort of students with disability, with an additional $10 million in targeted funding made available. As Minister for Education and Minister for Disability Services, it is these commitments to improvements for all our children that unlock the opportunity for all Tasmanian children to reach their full potential. 

Twenty-four schools from around the state are included in our $294 million investment in education infrastructure over the next four years. This investment also includes our $10 million Playground and Sports Courts Upgrade Program; a large portion of our $15 million Teacher Residence Upgrade Program; development of our three new Child and Family Learning Centres; and just over $20 million towards our VET facilities fund, delivering modern, fit-for-purpose vocational education and training facilities and industry-standard equipment for our secondary schools, colleges and trade training centres.

We also care deeply about our incredible teachers who turn up each and every day to inspire the learning of our children and young people. We're investing in their wellbeing through the School Staff Wellbeing Response Team, a clear commitment by our government to supporting the health, wellbeing and retention of Tasmania's school workforce, ensuring better outcomes for staff and ultimately better outcomes for our students. Our commitment is backed by funding of $1 million each year for five years through the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement.

The team has been established to provide dedicated wellbeing support to staff in schools across the state, with a particular focus on complex settings. It brings a wealth of knowledge from diverse backgrounds including frontline and emergency services, staff wellbeing, mental health and critical incidents response. By ensuring the right supports are in place at the right time, the School Staff Wellbeing Response Team will help with earlier identification of wellbeing needs and making sure staff get access to help and support that makes a difference. The team will work closely with principals and staff to build a positive and proactive wellbeing culture, and strengthen each school's capacity to support staff wellbeing into the future.

Broader support is being strengthened for all schools through a modernised Staff Wellbeing Support Services Program. A panel of highly qualified providers will deliver this enhanced service which builds on the existing Employee Assistance Program. The new model, called Wellbeing Connect, is designed to better meet the evolving personal and professional needs of all DECYP staff, including those in schools not currently receiving targeted support from the response team.

Key enhancements include individual supports, with the redesigned model introducing several significant enhancements to individual support offerings, including the new Staff Wellbeing Support Program, a proactive initiative offering all new employees a wellbeing check-in within their first six months, along with access to an additional counselling session.

QUESTONS

Homes Tasmania

Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER for HOUSING and PLANNING, Mr VINCENT

[2.30 p.m.]
Budget Paper 2, volume 2, states that Homes Tasmania is responsible for delivering the government's 10 year plan to provide an additional 10,000 social and affordable homes by 2032. The budget papers also make it clear that Homes Tasmania's interest bearing liabilities, that is its debt, is forecast to double from $476 million this year to more than a $1 billion by 2029. In hindsight, it makes a celebration of the forgiving of the Commonwealth state housing debts seem quaint indeed.

Do you agree that Homes Tasmania is a model that was set up perhaps with the best of good intentions but is actually failing to deliver and saddling the body that should be delivering social and affordable housing with absolutely unaffordable levels of debt?

ANSWER

Mr President, it is a very interesting question. I will do my best to answer it.

In the time I've been Housing minister, I've seen a lot of information come across my desk and been involved with a lot of discussions. In hindsight - marvellous thing, hindsight - and I wasn't around when it was swung over, but I am extremely committed to the model that's there at the moment - in part.

The Crawford report has been very sensible about things that need to be fine-tuned. When you think about most other organisations, after a two-year period there's usually a review period. Probably some of these things could have been done earlier but under my tenure, we are working through those issues, and we know there are quite a few issues.

When you look at the debt burden of Homes, if you snapped your fingers and wanted to put all the people on the waiting list into a unit or home, you're in the vicinity of $3 billion required to do that, in simple multiplication of the numbers. There is a lot of work when you look at the national level and trying to keep up with what other states are doing to keep abreast of that with similar proportional numbers are involved also.

My commitment is to work with the interim chair, Ben Wilson, to deliver a much better model with fine-tuning of some of the things in the Crawford report that will speed up the number of homes or units or assistance to homeless organisations in a quicker way. When you look at the numbers achieved by Homes Tasmania, it is still substantial. We talk about the negatives of the growing list, but behind that is some substantial work done already.

In talking to several of the providers, they are in a position of willing to talk about different measures that may assist in dealing with some of the root causes instead of the end cause. I am open to all those conversations.

I can give you my commitment that over the next few months and early into next year, we will see, in my opinion, a much more deliverable Homes Tasmania than people are criticising at the moment. I am trying not to look back too much other than to learn from it and try to see how I can use my knowledge to deliver more and in a more efficient way into the future.


JCP Youth and BLACKOUT Challenge Program

Ms WEBB question to LEADER for the GOVERNMENT in the LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Ms RATTRAY referred to MINISTER for CHILDREN and YOUTH, Ms PALMER

[2.34 p.m.]
In relation to the government's arrangements with the organisation JCP Youth, and specifically regarding the organisation BLACKOUT challenge program, which recently saw on or around 10 October this year, a series of photos published on the JCP social media pages, including Instagram and Facebook, and which included images of JCP workers dressed in pseudo-military fatigues and wearing balaclavas to hide their identity, plus separate images of an 11-year-old boy who was apparently the sole young person from a total of 43 BLACKOUT Program participants to complete the entire five-day course, can the government:

confirm when it became aware of the JCP BLACKOUT campaign social media posts, including those of adults in balaclavas and pseudo-military apparel and child participants, and whether the government considers these images and their communication over public social media platforms to be appropriate;

detail any action, immediately and/or longer-term action taken in relation to these images;

confirm whether the 11-year-old boy who was named and identifiable in the JCP Youth social media posts is under state care and protection and/or any type of youth justice order and, if so, was permission or approval sought by the relevant agency for the publication of the photos;

noting these particular social media posts appear to have been removed sometime after the 24 October, clarify when those posts were removed and whether the government is aware of the reasons for the removal of these photos and posts;

further noting reference to the 11-year-old boy in social media posts included information that he was from the south of the state, please detail how the 43 participants of the BLACKOUT Challenge Program were transported to the site on the north-west coast and back to their respective locations;

clarify what criteria and guidance JCP Youth is using to make a determination of 'mature minor', also referred to as 'Gillick competency' for the purposes of children and young people aged 11 to 17 years of age providing informed consent to services and subsequent publication; and

confirm whether appropriate written consent was obtained from or on behalf of all 43 participants of the recent BLACKOUT campaign;

under schedule 2, section 2.2.5, Activities of the Funding Agreement, detail what government oversight and compliance of any criteria used by JCP Youth for informed consent in this context is undertaken; and

when did the last state compliance check or oversight check occur?

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the honourable member for the questions. I will be answering in my capacity as Minister for Children and Youth:

my office was contacted by a constituent on 17 October 2025, raising concerns about a JCP Youth social media post in relation to its BLACKOUT Program. My office subsequently requested information from the Department for Education, Children and Young People about the BLACKOUT Program. I'm advised that the BLACKOUT is a challenge-based, camp-style program offered by JCP Youth. Participants in JCP Youth's BEAST Program may opt to participate in the BLACKOUT Program. Participants of BEAST who are referred by DECYP may opt to participate in the BLACKOUT Program. 

I'm also advised the majority of the recent BLACKOUT Program participants were not young people referred by DECYP to the JCP Youth BEAST Program and, therefore, outside the contract agreement. I'm advised that where face coverings were worn by staff as part of the BLACKOUT Program, this was discussed with participants prior to commencing the program and was done in good nature as part of the program of a full BLACKOUT. Where face coverings are worn by staff, this is done briefly and by people who are well-known to all participants. All required consents were obtained for publishing photos of the participants on social media and approval obtained prior to posting.

I'm advised the face coverings worn by young people participating in the program were done to not include faces when having their photo shared to social media, in accordance with the wishes of the young people and their families. I'm advised that JCP Youth has recognised the perception from the wider public from the use of images involving face coverings, particularly involving children and young people, and has subsequently removed the post.

I'm advised that the Secretary of the Department for Education, Children and Young People is seeking a meeting with the JCP Youth CEO and board. I have requested the department undertake an assessment of the appropriateness of the BLACKOUT Program for DECYP-referred BEAST participants.

The government cannot comment on individual children and young people's details for confidentiality reasons. I'm advised consent was obtained by the individual young person participating and their guardians before the social media post was published online. It is my expectation that JCP Youth complies with all relevant legislation and obligations in accordance with its agreement with the Tasmanian government.

The social media content relating to the BLACKOUT Program is managed by JCP Youth and the government does not hold information regarding the timing or reasons for the removal of specific social media posts. I am advised that on becoming aware of the social media posts, DECYP contacted the JCP Youth CEO to discuss the use of social media in the context of activities involving [Bookmark: Phr3_O=56.5_D=15.0_C=0.86]  children and young people. I'm further advised the importance of exercising discretion when using social media was discussed and reinforced with JCP Youth, particularly where images of young participants are concerned.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=72.4_D=14.2_C=0.85] I'm advised that DECYP has contacted JCP Youth to seek further information and I have requested the department to provide me with an update as soon as this information is available.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=87.2_D=1.7_C=0.72]  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=92.3_D=8.7_C=0.71] I'm advised JCP Youth obtained written consent from each participant and their guardians engaged in the recent BLACKOUT Program [Bookmark: Phr7_O=102.7_D=28.4_C=0.84] .

Under schedule 2, section 2.2.5 2025, Activities of the Funding Agreement, JCP Youth must obtain written consent from both the referred participant and the participant's parents or guardian before the participant commences in the program.

I am advised DECYP last met with JCP Youth on 28 October 2025 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=131.2_D=15.6_C=0.85]  as part of regular governance oversight meetings. JCP Youth submits annual service delivery reports, including details of how JCP Youth meets relevant legislative requirements, and the quarterly service delivery reports. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=147.3_D=16.2_C=0.82]  I'm advised that DCP has contacted JCP Youth to seek further information and I've requested the department provide me with an update as soon as this information is available. 

Where I have had to request further information, I will bring that information back to the House.


Richmond AFL Game in Hobart - Costs and Support

Ms ARMITAGE question to MINISTER for SPORT, Mr DUIGAN

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=165.2_D=1.4_C=0.40] [2.43 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=167.8_D=12.7_C=0.75] I have been told by the minister's office or staff that you probably can't answer the questions. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=181.1_D=5.2_C=0.65]  However, I'm quite sure that the minister, Mr Duigan, can answer for me some questions regarding AF [Bookmark: Phr13_O=188.4_D=8.5_C=0.68] L bookings, and probably a little bit disappointing that they've taken some responsibility off him in the past and I'm sure he'd be more than capable and quite happy to have some of it back. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=198.3_D=23.3_C=0.78]  I appreciate that he might not be able to answer some of the questions, but I know he will do his very best.

Can the minister confirm what the costs to government are regarding the recent announcement for Richmond to play an AFL home game in Hobart? Can the minister confirm that the decision made to support Richmond playing in Hobart will not adversely affect Hawthorn and commitments for AFL in Launceston? [Bookmark: Phr15_O=222.8_D=13.0_C=0.80]  Can the minister update the Chamber on the government's position on continuing to support Hawthorn playing at the redeveloped UTAS Stadium, ensuring support for Launceston and northern Tasmania and not just Hobart?

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=237.0_D=28.0_C=0.76] Second, Richmond CEO Shane Dunn says[tbc]:

The club's reasons for selling a home game to Tasmania are more than commercial, and from a football perspective, we're hopeful that we can align our VFL fixture to this game, creating another opportunity for our developing list to travel together. 

Can the minister please advise if there are plans to align the VFL team and Richmond, playing a VFL home game in Tasmania? I find it very unusual. It's almost like confuse and conquer. We have Stadiums Tasmania, we have Events Tasmania and we have Sport. I would have hoped that the minister should have some responsibility there. Hopefully, minister, they will give that back to you, but I would love you to come up with something, if you can, for the people of the north who are quite concerned about Hawthorn and [Bookmark: Phr18_O=290.6_D=1.7_C=0.64]  how long they will be playing in Launceston.

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=293.9_D=11.0_C=0.61] Mr President, I thank the member for Launceston for the question. It is a good one and I was very pleased to be at Ninja Stadium yesterday for the announcement of the Richmond Football Club playing two games in the state, one next year and one the following year. I can confirm that the publicly known amount for that, I believe mentioned yesterday, was at $1 million per game. It's a $2 million investment from the government to have Richmond play those two home games in Hobart. I think it's very important - 

Ms Forrest - They got flogged when they were here at the end of the year, by the mighty Roos.

Mr DUIGAN - I can't comment there, but we do know that Richmond has a very large following in Tasmania. I'm reliably informed that the two biggest footy crowds at Ninja Stadium have both been for Tiger games, so I believe it's a positive step. 

We know from a long period of time - over 25 years now - with Hawthorn playing in Launceston, what we see by way of return in terms of the government's investment, with a 5:1 return on investment typically the case for Hawthorn games. We will see that continue through a new deal, which is a $9.1 million deal to have four men's Hawthorn games at UTAS Stadium in 2026 and again in 2027. That is four regular season games and a practice match. We see Hawthorn continuing to be a very important part of the footy landscape there, as we build towards the very exciting change in the landscape in Tasmanian sport with the introduction of the Tasmania Devils Football Club in 2028. I think we're all really looking forward to that. 

I should also point out that the Tasmania Devils VFL team will be running around next year. Again, to your point about Richmond aligning its VFL schedule to have that VFL game here in Hobart as well, I don't have any detail about that, but if the CEO of the club is saying that, then that's likely to be the case. 

In terms of where this sits, the Hawthorn deal, and indeed the Richmond deal, are major event partnerships and thus funded by Events Tasmania and sit in that portfolio. Regarding the continuation or otherwise of those things, it would be remiss of me to comment, other than to say I think the Premier is on the record as saying that at least, I believe, for 2028 and 2029, that there will be more football in the north, not less. There'll be a minimum of six games at the redeveloped UTAS Stadium. Whether that turns out to be Hawthorn or the mighty and magnificent Tasmania Devils, that remains to be seen. What we can all look forward to is more AFL, AFLW, VFL and VFLW in Tasmania as we rightfully take our position on the national stage. 


Homes Tasmania - Funding

Ms O'CONNOR question to MINISTER for HOUSING and PLANNING, Mr VINCENT

[2.48 p.m.]
I want to apologise upfront because I know he has a very sore knee - I feel a bit bad making you walk across to the lectern. 

In response to my earlier question, you said something very interesting about Homes Tasmania. You said you're extremely committed to it 'in part'. I would like to explore with you a little bit more what that means. Budget Paper 1 in its Risks, Sensitivities and Presentation section says of Homes Tasmania: 'The funding and delivery model is placing increased fiscal pressure on the State Budget.' Minister, can you agree on the evidence that the funding and delivery model for Homes Tasmania is unsustainable? It's potentially inefficient and ineffective in terms of delivering on the government's stated policy objective to deliver 10,000 new homes by 2032.

ANSWER

Mr President, I thank the member for her kind thoughts in my movements today, and over the next few weeks until I can make the surgery list. 

I don't agree with your assumptions. The debt level - to fix the situation we're in - not just in Tasmania but everywhere - is going to cost. However, if you look at some of the papers, you'll see that Homes Tasmania, with developments like the old Penguin sports ground and Huntingfield, have a sensible ratio or mixture of social and affordable units and houses, and a genuine blend of the blocks that are available for sale. If you look at that, it's about an 85/15 split, 85 per cent for affordable housing and general sale of blocks and housing; 15 per cent for what they keep in the social, affordable rentals and other parts of it. 

That formula comes around through the balance of being able to sell some of those blocks to pay for some of the others. Homes Tas have had substantial outlays with Huntingfield over a number of years, also with Penguin and some of the other land that we've put aside, like at Warrane recently, where it will take time for that catch-up of the balance to assist in paying for some of these homes to happen.

My comment regarding Homes Tasmania, in part, referred to what I also added there of the Margaret Crawford report - there are things that have to change. The principle of Homes Tasmania delivering what it needs to, to me, doesn't change whether it's inside government or separate as a statutory authority. It is the mechanisms that the identity has to deliver what we need for social and affordable housing in Tasmania, and that's the part that I mean where we can fine-tune the model, in my firm belief, to make it better going forward. That's where my part commitment and commitment to the Crawford report in making those changes to make it more efficient.

Supplementary Question

Ms O'CONNOR - A supplementary, Mr President?

Mr PRESIDENT - The member for Hobart.

Ms O'CONNOR - I beg to differ on whether or not it makes a difference that it's a government business or a government agency. Since it became a government business, it's only been able to fund the delivery of new construction based on borrowings and partnerships to try to secure Commonwealth funding, which is not always successful, as it wasn't in the first half round.

If you want to take this on notice, that's okay: could you detail to the Council how many social homes, how many affordable homes Homes Tasmania has been primarily responsible for delivering since it came into being on 1 December 2022.

Mr President, on your indulgence, I mean this as no disrespect to the good people who work in Homes Tasmania. I'm talking about the structure and the model.

Mr VINCENT - Mr President, to make sure that the figures are accurate and the break-up is accurate, I have some general numbers that run to that mid-4500 they've already done. However, I would like to take that on notice so that we are accurate in the break-up and definition of those different parts.

Ms O'Connor - Thank you. From 1 December 2022 is the start date.


Integrity Commission - Funding

Ms WEBB question to LEADER for the GOVERNMENT, Ms RATTRAY

[2.53 p.m.]
With reference to statements made by former chief commissioner of the Integrity Commission, Greg Melick AO KC, regarding the need for appropriate resourcing and staffing of the commission to function properly and in accordance with public expectations and in light of the recent Anti-Corruption Commission's 'why they are undermined' and 'towards best practice' conference held in Melbourne last month, can the government:

Kingston Learning Centre
 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=140.6_D=8.6_C=0.83] 
Ms WEBB question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[2.57 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=151.0_D=5.8_C=0.50] Regarding the long-term security of the Kingston Learning Centre based at the old Kingston Primary School site, are you aware of ongoing concern over access to the U3A Kingborough and other community organisations reliant upon access to the learning centre facility, including important car parking facilities? Can you confirm that despite the promised community liaison on on this matter, it now appears that community groups have been locked out of parking facilities on the premises, including the lawn area where they have parked previously?

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=187.6_D=21.3_C=0.88] Further, can you confirm the government is considering plans to redevelop the old Kingston Primary School site? If this is the case, is it also the intention for the Kingston Library to be relocated from its current site? Finally, is it the intention for the government to sell this site or undertake the redevelopment itself, and what consultation has occurred regarding any redevelopment plans for this site?

ANSWER
 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=218.1_D=29.1_C=0.85] 
Mr President, the Kingston Learning Centre car park was recently closed for several weeks by Libraries Tasmania due to a safety incident. I am deeply mindful of the impact this closure has had on valued community groups and recognise the disruption the closure caused. It is important to remember it happened because [Bookmark: Phr19_O=247.9_D=29.4_C=0.86]  there there was a safety incident. I understand a section of the car park was reopened on 29 September with safety measures in place to reasonably manage risks. These concerns are being carefully balanced with the need to ensure there is public safety, which remains the highest priority.

I understand Libraries Tasmania has worked with affected client groups and the vast majority have been [Bookmark: Phr20_O=277.4_D=27.6_C=0.82]  able to be accommodated in the two main buildings that are accessible via the reopened car park. I am also advised Libraries Tasmania held a community forum at Kingston Library in early October 2025 and it will continue to provide the community with regular updates.

With regard to some of your latter questions, I certainly have no awareness of any plans to redevelop the site or indeed to sell the site.


Kingston Learning Centre - Parking

Ms WEBB question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[3.00 p.m.]
Is the minister aware there's still significant inadequacy in terms of car parking. While there was one safety issue in many years that might have triggered the closure of the car parks, there now are significant safety issues with elderly people having to park elsewhere and walk to the site across busy roads?

Is the minister aware that many of these U3A and other participants have protested today by having elderly people who have to walk across the road doing so together outside the facility in Kingston to demonstrate the safety risk? Is the minister aware of that safety risk?

ANSWER

Mr President, we want to have these sites first and foremost safe and think that's a very reasonable position to take.

My expectation of Libraries Tasmania is it engages with the community, keeping them up to date about what is happening in that area. As far as I am aware, it is doing that.

I am very aware of the disappointment and the level of frustration for the many users of that area. We are certainly working through what is a good solution, rather than just a band-aid fix on what can we do to have a long-term solution.

In the meantime, my expectation is, and I have no reason to believe it's not happening, that Libraries Tasmania is certainly communicating and trying to keep the communities as up to date as it can.


MOTION

Noting - Budget Papers 2025-26 and Appropriation Bills (No. 1 and No. 2)

Resumed from above (page xx).

[3.02 p.m.]
Ms PALMER (Minister for Education) - Mr President, I had reached the point in my contribution where I was leaning into some of the key enhancements on individual supports with the redesigned modelling introducing several significant enhancements to individual support offerings, which includes:

New staff wellbeing Support program, which is a proactive initiative offering all new employees a wellbeing check-in within their first six months along with access to an additional counselling session. This aims to support smoother transitions and to reduce barriers to help seeking early in an employment journey.

Enhanced traumatic incident support. A real strengthening of a commitment to provide timely psychological first aid and tailored counselling for individual staff that are affected by traumatic events.

Looking at response support, the new model introduces a two-tiered response framework for incidents and/or cumulative harm as follows:

urgent staff wellbeing response; that's immediate support following an emotionally impactful incident or event. That was formerly termed critical incidents response.

Also, there is the staff wellbeing recovery support plan. This sees medium-term interventions to assist staff in processing and recovering from the emotional impacts events as well as business units or schools experiencing cumulative harm or potential harm. This approach ensures that the response is centred on the emotional well-being of staff.

This is also a budget for young Tasmanians. It is a budget we believe will set them up to succeed, not just in school but also in life. Protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of Tasmania's vulnerable children and young people is a clear priority for the Tasmanian government.

The Budget continues to drive delivery of the 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future, which ensures the safety and wellbeing of children, young people and their families. It upholds the government's ongoing commitments to implementing the recommendations arising from the commission of inquiry with significant investment into children and youth over the next four years.

The 2025-26 Budget provides additional funding of $15 million over two years, commencing in 2025-26, for out-of-home care services to Tasmanian children and young people. This is building on the $120 million over four years provided in the 2024-25 Budget which increased that baseline funding for out-of-home care, delivering on our commitment to meeting commission of inquiry recommendation 9.1.

The total out-of-home care budget is in excess of $90 million per annum. We're continuing to deliver on our commitment to ensuring every child and young person is known, safe, well and learning by providing further investment in children and youth across 2025-26 and the forward Estimates.

We've provided $10.32 million to support the ongoing delivery of critical support to new parents and their babies through Bringing Baby Home. This program is delivered by our non-government partners to strengthen parenting capacity and family functioning, to enable new families to remain together safely at home; $8 million over two years has been provided for the Intensive Family Engagement Service for the continuation of targeted support to families who are experiencing complex issues which impact the safety and wellbeing of children and young people. This funding supports the continued offering of up to 88 packages per year in support of families who are at risk of entering the statutory system.

Transition to Independence is a supportive after-care program for children and young people who've spent time in care and who are transitioning into adulthood. We've provided $6.2 million so that up to 120 young people can receive extended support when needed, ensuring that their transition from out-of-home care is measured, person-centred and meets individual needs. Our government recognises the important role that foster and kinship carers play in providing a safe, stable and nurturing home for some of our children and young people.

During the 2025 Tasmanian election, we committed to providing a 15 per cent increase to the base rate of support payments for all foster and formal kinship carers in Tasmania. We have delivered on our commitment by providing just over $2 million to support a temporary 12-month uplift to provide immediate support, while ensuring that future investment is guided by genuine consultation, lived experience and the outcomes of the broader reform agenda.

The Tasmanian government's Strong Families Safe Kids child safety reforms are improving outcomes for children, young people and their families. Under our reforms, more families are receiving the support they need to stay together and keep their children safe without the need for statutory child intervention. It has never been more important to deliver a youth justice system that is therapeutic and addresses youth offending behaviours at its core. We want to ensure at-risk children and young people are diverted from the youth justice system by providing the courts with improved bail and place-based options so that a custodial sentence is the absolute last resort.

The Youth Justice Blueprint 2024-2034 and the commission of inquiry recommendations provide the clear pathway to achieve successful youth justice reform for Tasmania. It is ambitious reform, but I am proud to be the Minister for Children and Youth playing my part in this important and much-needed reform agenda. I want children and young people who interact with the youth justice system to become the very best versions of themselves and I want our Tasmanian communities to remain safe.

We're committed to closing the Ashley Youth Detention Centre as soon as possible and developing a new facility based on a therapeutic, rights-based and child-focused model of care. To deliver on this commitment, a total of $155.3 million is allocated to building the new youth justice facility in the south of the state at Pontville. The vision for the new facility is to enable an environment where children and young people experience the highest standards of child-centred, rights-based and therapeutic care and education, services and opportunities, supporting them to enhance connections, return and remain successfully in the community.

The new facility at Pontville will be homelike in its design and much smaller than the current Ashley facility. A model of care is being developed which will also incorporate access to critical services such as health [Bookmark: Phr3_O=18.3_D=16.5_C=0.88] , education and vocational training, and connection to family and community. Until the new youth justice facility is operational, we are focused on enhancing safety and oversight and ensuring Ashley is delivering a therapeutic model of care.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=35.3_D=12.4_C=0.84] We are committed to building a youth justice system that diverts children and young people away from offending, risk-taking behaviours, detention and prevents re-entry. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=48.9_D=21.9_C=0.86]  We also continue our investment in place-based diversionary approaches by investing $2.3 million to support innovative local initiatives and partnerships that target the root causes of youth offending in local communities, and engage children and young people in education, training, employment, sport and the arts.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=71.5_D=14.8_C=0.87] With the place-based funding, $300,000 has been allocated for initiatives in the Brighton municipality and $500,000 for initiatives in Glenorchy where we know youth offending has been concerning for its residents and businesses. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=87.0_D=21.6_C=0.87]  This demonstrates we are acting on the commitment to deliver meaningful youth justice reform. We are on the right path and we cannot deviate. We have achieved a great deal, but there is so much more work to be done to deliver the Tasmanian youth justice reform vision outlined in the Youth Justice Blueprint and commission of inquiry recommendations. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=109.7_D=6.4_C=0.88]  I am committed to delivering the youth justice reform vision as Minister for Children and Youth.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=117.2_D=19.8_C=0.86] What a monumental year it has been for people with disability in Tasmania. Our historic and nation leading Disability Rights, Inclusion and Safeguarding Act 2024 commenced on 1 July this year: an incredible step in creating a safer and more inclusive Tasmania for people living with disability. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=137.7_D=29.7_C=0.85]  Our funding this year of $13.3 million for 2025-26 in the Disability Services portfolio includes our continued commitment to implementing the act. A key measure of the implementation of the DRIS act is the establishment of the Disability Commissioner of Tasmania. Our inaugural Disability Commissioner, Catherine Whitington[checked], commenced in early May this year. She brings a wealth of experience to the role and her own [Bookmark: Phr11_O=167.6_D=8.8_C=0.87]  lived experience as a person with disability. I am thrilled the commissioner's stand-alone, accessible office will open in the coming weeks.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=177.2_D=19.0_C=0.85] In addition to funding the Office of the Disability Commissioner under this output, we also fund the Office of the Senior Practitioner, another key measure under our DRIS act. I'm reminded every single day of the significance of the act and what it means for our Tasmanian disability community [Bookmark: Phr13_O=196.8_D=24.8_C=0.83] . At a recent Speak Out conference in Devonport last month. I could see the pride of so many in our disability community as I looked around the room and I shared with them some of their own words on what inclusivity means to them, words that shaped much of the why behind our new act, and words that were shared on the floor of both Houses as the act passed parliament last year. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=222.2_D=4.1_C=0.63]  I could see and I heard firsthand what this meant to them [Bookmark: Phr15_O=226.8_D=8.0_C=0.88] ; another reminder that we must always seek to undertake reform with a 'nothing for us without us' approach.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=236.3_D=14.6_C=0.85] Also included in our 2025-26 interim Budget is our continued investment in key disability advocacy groups in Tasmania, disability reform funding to ensure Tasmanians with disability and Tasmanian disability providers [Bookmark: Phr17_O=251.6_D=16.8_C=0.84]  can navigate the significant reform underway and, as always, providing continuity of supports for people eligible under the DRIS but not eligible under the NDIS. Of course, we continue to support Tasmanians on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=268.7_D=15.9_C=0.87]  This year alone we are investing over $287 million as part of our bilateral agreement with the Commonwealth to deliver a range of supports for Tasmanians living with disability, including funding specialist disability support services [Bookmark: Phr19_O=284.9_D=2.9_C=0.88]  provided by the National Disability Insurance Scheme.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=288.5_D=13.8_C=0.83] I know there is a lot of uncertainty amongst many in our disability community as we continue to navigate changes to the NDIS, and as work is done to finalise foundational supports [Bookmark: Phr21_O=302.8_D=2.2_C=0.48] . I want to reassure Tasmanians with disability, and their families and carers, that we will keep your interests at the forefront. We are steadfast in our advocacy for Tasmanians with disability and we will ensure, through these significant changes to the NDIS, that Tasmanians and their families do not lose out.

I am so proud to speak about the region that I represent in this place, the electorate of Rosevears, and the transformative infrastructure and community commitments provided for my electorate within this Budget. I have been so proud of our recent delivery in the education space, including our brand new $33.7 million Legana Primary School, which opened to students this year, and our $11 million major redevelopment of Exeter High School, which I was just thrilled to have a sneak peek of just a few weeks ago. One of the most significant new projects for our region is the construction of a new ambulance station at Legana.

Legana is one of Tasmania's fastest-growing areas, and with that growth comes the responsibility to ensure essential services keep pace. The new Legana Ambulance Station will be a dedicated, contemporary and purpose-built ambulance station that will house all of Ambulance Tasmania's requirements with the capacity for future expansion of services. This investment will reduce response times, ease pressure on existing facilities, and deliver emergency care closer to home for thousands of residents. It is about ensuring that families in Legana, Grindelwald and surrounds can rest easier, knowing help is never far away.

Our government also recognises the importance for women to have access to specialist healthcare services they need. Our $3.8 million investment to expand services at The Bubble will ensure more women and girls in the region, including in my electorate of Rosevears, can have access to specialist sexual, reproductive and mental health services delivered by an all-female team of incredible doctors who understand women's health needs.

Anyone who travels through northern Tasmania knows the East Tamar Highway and the West Tamar Highway are vital arteries not only for locals but for businesses, for our farmers, our tourists and of course, freight. As provided within this Budget, we are upgrading both highways, improving safety, efficiency and resilience. These initiatives are about equity, ensuring that people in regional and outer suburban areas have just as much access to opportunity, education and employment as anyone else in the state.

These are not just projects on a spreadsheet; they are meaningful investments in the quality of life for the people in Rosevears. They are about listening to what our communities need: safer roads, better schools, accessible transport and faster emergency care, and then delivering practical results. They are about supporting growth while preserving the character and the charm that make Rosevears such a special place to live, to work and raise a family.

They reflect the values of the people I represent: fairness, forward thinking and a deep care for community. They also show what good government can achieve when it stays focused on outcomes, listens to local voices and backs our regions with real action. At its heart, this is a budget about opportunity. This Budget continues to invest in the future skills, knowledge and wellbeing of our people and it gives our children the tools that they need to build a better Tasmania.

[3.19 p.m.]
Ms THOMAS (Elwick) - Mr President, I rise to note the 2025-26 budget, or the interim Budget, as the government has referred to it, the one that follows the state election that was triggered by the no-confidence motion brought in response to the dismal Budget tabled by the government back in June. This is my third budget reply for what is effectively the second budget I have been presented with in this place. The first Budget I spoke about was also presented out of cycle in September 2024, following an early election in March 2024, triggered by the defection of two Liberal Party members that resulted in a minority government and, ultimately, a loss of confidence and supply on the Floor in the other place. 

Then, in April this year, I spoke on a supplementary appropriation bill too when it became apparent that the appropriation we had approved in September 2024 was not enough to sustain government operations: surprise, surprise. I'm sure other longer-serving members in this place will be able to recall how often this happens. Indeed, Saul Eslake commented in the Mercury on the weekend about the regularity with which this has occurred over the past couple of decades. I quote Mr Eslake who said:

History strongly suggests that the forward Estimates of operating expenses in today's interim Budget will be exceeded, as they have been in all but two of the past 21 financial years, including by $492 million in 2024-25. [TBC]

I know in speaking on this supplementary appropriation bill in April, I and other members suggested that the government should look at why this happens. I think we all know that underestimating the estimated spend makes the books look better at budget time. Taking a good look under the hood might make for good governance, but perhaps not for good politics.

We see more of this riddled throughout this interim Budget, in which we see spending gaps, significant reductions in operational spending in the final out year of 2028-29, or even three little dots in some instances, indicating an estimated spend of $0 in forward Estimates against some line items in order to help achieve a picture of a little surplus in 2028-29. I may not be an economist or an accountant - indeed I'm not - but I'm not a fool either. According to the Treasurer's budget speech:

Responsible governments must never lose sight of their core duty to manage the public finances wisely so that the next generation inherits both opportunity and stability. [TBC]

The process and timing of budget delivery and supplementary appropriations in recent years hardly paint a picture of stability, do they? The instability and significant cuts estimated in the final year of the forward Estimates certainly creates uncertainty and distress for public servants, community organisations, business, industry and families trying to put food on the table. I'm so disappointed in this Budget and simply despair at the dire financial position this state is in. I'm extremely disappointed in this government's lack of willingness to take advice and work together with experts and other members of parliament on solutions to this financial crisis that we are in.

The Pre-Election Financial Outlook Report (PEFO), published in June this year, painted a clear picture of the Department of Treasury and Finance's assessment of the budget situation. The key findings made it clear that the state's budget - the general government sector - has a structural problem. The PEFO said that expenses, significantly driven by health demand and costs, are growing at a faster rate than the state's current sources of revenue. It said that the structural imbalance has developed over a number of years. 

Recent state budgets and forward Estimates have been defined by increasing deficits and debt. As a state, we are spending more than we are earning, and the gap is growing. The PEFO report goes on to say that: 

... economic growth correlates weakly with general government sector revenue in Tasmania. Accordingly, this structural problem will not be resolved through future economic growth. Explicit policy choices are required. [TBC]

Without interventions that move the state onto a different fiscal trajectory, the Australian Bureau of Statistics' Government Finance Statistics net debt for the general government sector is projected to grow from $4.2 billion in 2024-25 to $13 billion by 2027-28, the PEFO said. Under this scenario, annual interest costs are projected to rise by approximately 202 per cent from $230.9 million to $697.9 million over the same period. This will reduce the state's ability to manage economic shocks and to provide services to the community in the future. This rate of growth in debt is not sustainable, and the size of the problem will only increase if it is not addressed. The PEFO said, 'Immediate and sustained action is needed.'

The report also says that a combination of revenue and expenditure measures will be required. No single class of intervention is likely to be sufficient to move Tasmania to a sustainable fiscal trajectory. Yet, the Treasurer's budget speech does not provide any mention of how the government might increase revenue. To the contrary, it clearly and proudly commits that there will be no new taxes.

Again, referring to comments in the Mercury on the weekend by Mr Eslake, a leading economist and the author of the government-commissioned 'Independent Review of Tasmania State Finances' that was published in 2024:

Action to rein in spending, raise revenue and pay down debt have been put off yet again. The formidable task of budget repair has been kicked down the road to the 2026-27 Budget to be presented in May next year. [TBC]

The interim Budget reaffirms, although that's obviously not its intention, that properly measured Tasmania's financial position is worse than that of any other state or territory.

Tasmania's projected non-financial public sector cash deficits will be larger as a percentage of gross state product than those of any other state or territory, while Tasmania's non-financial public sector net financial liabilities represent a bigger proportion of Tasmania's gross state product than those of any other state or territory.

Mr Eslake goes on to say: 

It's not as if the government hasn't had plenty of advice from the Treasury and from me among others, as to the seriousness of Tasmania's financial position. [TBC]

Yes, the Treasurer's budget speech does acknowledge there is a problem here. The Treasurer does acknowledge Tasmania's ongoing need for fiscal reform, but even the way the Treasurer acknowledges it shirks responsibility to a degree. Tasmania's ongoing need for fiscal reform is what the Treasurer said, not the government's need for fiscal reform. There is a severe lack of ownership taken.

The budget speech is laden with blame on others, contrary to the opening statement that responsible governments must never lose sight of their core duty to manage the public finances wisely for the next generation.

Throughout the speech there is blame placed on COVID, labour market pressures, federal government neglect, blame on the opposition's policy decisions when they were in government more than a decade ago, references to declining returns from government-owned businesses and even - wait for it - early elections.

Why are early elections costly one might ask? Well, the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook makes reference to this too.

It states: 

Election commitments are often implemented as additional expenditure measures, rather than through reallocation or reprioritisation of existing resources.

The previous three state elections in 2018, 2021 and 2024 added an additional $1.4 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion respectively in operating and capital expenditure to the existing budget and forward estimates at that time. This compares to $400.7 million of election commitments made during the 2014 state election. [TBC]

We have had four state elections in seven years - almost $5 billion of debt racked up through four elections over the decade between 2014 and 2024. That is $5 billion. Billions of dollars of taxpayer money handed out like lollies with no proper process or consideration to merit, fairness and equity. It is not the early elections that have sent us broke; it's the funding promises made to win power that have sent us broke.

I am disappointed the government continues to ignore the facts and the experts and rather chooses to play the blame game. I am disappointed that we miss the opportunity presented by the hard work, goodwill and 'let's help fix it' intent from our independent member for Murchison last week in her quest to establish a budget oversight and accountability committee to help collectively find our way out of this mess. I am extremely disappointed in this government's prioritisation of the top end of town, big business and commercial sport over our community sector, grassroots clubs and everyday battlers in this Budget.

This Budget does not reflect the priorities of Tasmanians. The member for Huon nailed it back in June when he said in his budget reply, and I quote: 

We are going backwards into more debt and deficit. All that will do is load our children and grandchildren with an unfair start to their working life because we as a state could not manage money. This is not a responsible proposition. [TBC]

I wholeheartedly agree. This is not what Tasmanians want for future generations. To a large extent, Tasmanians don't care too much about the colour of the government, and the results of the 2024 and 2025 state elections demonstrate that. What Tasmanians care about is having elected members who will listen, elected members who will act to make decisions with the interests of everyday people and our state more broadly at heart. Regardless of political party affiliation, they rightly expect their members of parliament to work together to serve their best interests. Nothing angers people more than decisions made to serve political interests.

Next week in Estimates, I hope the government will be able to explain how it justifies this exorbitant proposed expenditure on high-performance sporting infrastructure to serve an elite few, while thousands of kids miss out or play in substandard facilities with equipment from the 1980s. I have repeatedly said, even before I was elected to this place, that I support government investment in high-performance sport, but my support is contingent on the government adequately funding grassroots sport at the same time. 

Right now, the numbers in this Budget show that this is not occurring and not projected to occur over the forward Estimates. In fact, the opposite is true. Funding for grassroots sport is going down. The Budget includes $11.5 million for major sporting partnerships. There's no detail provided, as it has been in past years on what this is for. I assume it's for sponsorship deals with the AFL, JackJumpers and Cricket Tasmania. For professional commercialised sport funding continues to increase over time, whilst at the same time the amount provided to state sporting organisations for community programs has barely increased for decades and is on a downward trajectory over the forward Estimates. 

In fact, the sport and recreation budget line on page 248 of Budget Paper No. 2 shows the revenue appropriation for this output reducing from $84,168,000 in 2025-26, to just $24,312,000 in 2028-29. That's a 72 per cent reduction in funding for community and elite sport programs in four years - at a time when state sporting organisations are struggling to pay their bills, at a time when, more than ever, we need more investment in these programs to help keep kids off the streets, keep them engaged and active for the social and health benefits that brings.

Onto capital expenditure, and the Budget includes over $111 million for the Devils' high-performance training centre, whilst at the same time the Tasmanian Active Infrastructure Grants Program (TAIGP), which provides funding for grassroots sporting facilities, has been cut from $5 million per year to $2.5 million per year and is provided for the next two years only. The Budget provides $25 million to the relocation of two purpose-built ovals and club rooms for the community sports clubs at the Twin Ovals in Kingborough to make way for the Devils. That is $25 million to be spent on relocating perfectly happy clubs, that could instead be spent on desperately needed new facilities for indoor court sports in Hobart where there is not one single community indoor court - a facility that, during the election, the Liberal government promised $12.5 million towards. I will read into Hansard the promise by the Liberals in a media release from 17 July:

More basketball courts for the northern suburbs. A re-elected Tasmanian Liberal Government will partner with the Hobart City Council and invest $12.5 million to build a brand-new purpose-built basketball court facility at New Town Bay in Hobart's northern suburbs. The site has already been secured by the Hobart City Council, which has committed to its construction, car parking and ongoing maintenance. Architectural plans have been drawn up and a development application is in process. [TBC]

Premier Jeremy Rockliff said:

We are getting on with the job of supporting more community sporting infrastructure right around the state. We know the need for basketball courts is there following the outstanding success of the JackJumpers and we are responding. A Basketball Tasmania State facility strategy released earlier this year shows that basketball has experienced a surge in participation and our investment will pave the way for another four courts in the northern suburbs of Hobart. 

While the new court facility will become a home base for Hobart Phoenix, it will also be a community facility open to all, from young basketballers and school teams to adult players. Basketball continues to grow strongly in Tasmania, and a re-elected Liberal government is absolutely committed to seeing this continue, with Tasmanians to benefit as a result.' [TBC]

Well, it appears now they are elected, the government is kicking the can down the road on this commitment and putting caveats on their support. In typical Liberal government fashion, that Tasmanians are becoming ready to expect at every turn, last week the government wrote to Hobart Phoenix to inform them that the $12.5 million they promised at the election was not in the 2025-26 Budget. I expect they weren't the only ones made a promise at the election who received such a letter. On my quick read, I think only the funding to The Bubble that the minister referred to in her contribution just now, is the only election commitment that I can find funded in the Budget. 

I acknowledge what I said about the exorbitant cost of election commitments and the impact that they have had on our budget over time. However, if you make a commitment, you stick to it; that is what you do. After promising it during the election, the government is now saying they will consider it next year, but only if the federal government commits to funding the balance of the cost.

Ms Forrest - Do you believe them?

Ms THOMAS - Well, should I? I don't know that I do believe them. The letter to the Hobart Phoenix representative says: 

As you may be aware, due to the 2025 state election, the timing of the 2025-2026 state Budget was delayed and rescheduled 6 November. This delay has compressed the usual six-month development process into two months. As a result, the 2025-2026 Budget is by necessity an interim budget designed to maintain funding for essential services until the 2026-27 Budget is delivered in May next year. Accordingly, funding to support the Hobart City Council in establishing a new basketball court facility at New Town Bay was not able to be accommodated as part of the 2025-26 interim Budget. The Tasmanian Government remains committed to supporting this initiative.

The 2026-27 state Budget development process will include a full cycle of the ordinary state Budget development process. The Tasmanian Government will support this initiative as part of the 2026-27 state Budget development process, subject to the federal government contributing to the balance of the remaining costs above the Tasmanian government's commitment.

Yours sincerely, 
Jeremy Rockliff
Premier  [TBC]

Now, you can imagine the despair of these hardworking volunteers at this letter. They have been advocating for this project with evidence-based need for so long. Now, this condition of the Liberal government's commitment being contingent on federal government funding was not mentioned in the media release during the election period. There was no mention of this condition in any correspondence to Hobart City Council or Phoenix as far as I am aware.

This is shameful. It's deceitful and these backflips ruin people. Volunteers burned out, trying to get kids on the court, turning kids away, which I continue to provide warning will occur when Swisherr [OK] closes in May next year; they don't have time to wait. Meanwhile, the AFL calls and says they need an extra $60 million for the high-performance training centre. No worries, Mr Dillon, however much you need, whatever it costs, remember? That's the deal we signed on behalf of Tasmanians, an AFL team at all or any cost.

Millions of dollars for elite facilities to be owned or leased - we are not sure - for a small buck by commercial sporting entities, whilst at the same time our TIS athletes train in makeshift gym facilities located in office administration buildings at Technopark, and kids miss out on playing sport because there are not enough facilities in Hobart for them to play. Hobart becomes a place you can watch sport but not play it. The athletes aspiring to represent our state and country on the international stage at the Olympics are left behind by this government, whilst it dishes out millions to the AFL and NBL. It is simply not right and it is not fair. Shame on this government. It's time that our community sporting organisations were prioritised over and above, or at the very least equally to, professional sport run as a business.

The fact that we know some kids are missing out on the opportunity to play shows the government's priorities are unbalanced, skewed heavily towards investment in commercialised professional sport. On the stadium, the Treasurer's budget speech mentions that $609 million will be provided over four years for the Macquarie Point Stadium, made up of, by my calculations, $354 million state government funding, $240 million from the federal government and $15 million from the AFL. Of course, the rest of the at least $1.13 billion cost of the stadium, around $521 million, appears to be borrowed by the Macquarie Point Development Corporation, a government business. 

I note the $1.13 billion cost is an estimate and, again, as noted in the PEFO, the actual cost of construction will not be known until the project is put to tender. The PEFO also notes that the non-stadium projects referred to as conditions in the Macquarie Point Federal Funding Agreement will require gap funding by the state government: this represents an unfunded budget risk. This is exactly why I have been asking a range of questions on notice in relation to these unfunded commitments in recent sittings. Tasmanians deserve transparency here and parliamentarians need to understand the full details in order to make an informed decision on the Macquarie Point POSS order.

With no regard to these risks mentioned in the PEFO, the Treasurer's budget speech notes that, during construction, the stadium project is expected to add $269 million to the Tasmanian economy over five years, which, by my calculations, is around $53.8 million per year. The Treasurer says that, once operational, the stadium will add around $30 million to the economy each year.

Now, a note: the Treasurer may have been referring specifically to the stadium asset, not taking into account broader proposed benefits of increased tourism, other events and the further development of the AFL as an industry in Tasmania. However, based on this $30 million annual return quoted by the Treasurer, this equates to around $1.5 billion back to the Tasmanian economy over 50 years - not to the government, to the economy - $1.5 million to those who managed to reap some of the $1.5 billion reward, at a cost of around $45 million to 50 million per year to the taxpayer, by the calculations of the Coordinator-General and Tasmanian Planning Commission Panel respectively. 

By my rough sums, and I am happy to be corrected if I have calculated this wrong, this means the stadium will cost $1.13 billion to construct, then another $2.5 billion to cover the interest and operating costs subsidies, plus some on top for maintenance and depreciation costs over an expected life of 50 years; if only we could get some accurate estimates - or at least some estimates - on the lifecycle cost of the asset and an asset-management plan for this proposed project. By my calculations, this equates to a total government spend of around $3.63 billion for $1.5 billion return to the economy, and I'm not factoring in some of the additional projects required here either.

Money pouring into the Tasmanian economy more broadly, whilst that absolutely is a positive thing, is not going to pay the power bills at the stadium. It's not going to pay the interest on the loan. I'm just putting these things out as simple examples, and the very-hard-to-quantify social benefits would have to be worth around $2 billion to justify this investment. The stadium decision isn't all about the money, but this Budget is, and the two are related, which is why I'm talking about it here. 

At the end of the day, the government must be able to pay for the asset. We as members of parliament, and the Tasmanian community, deserve to know and understand the costs and how the government proposes to raise revenue to cover them, or what it intends to cut to cover them, in order to make an informed decision on this stadium. I will continue to seek clarity from the government on this, as other than evidence of cuts in the forward Estimates to services that are vitally important to the everyday person in our community, it's really not clear in this Budget how the government intends to pay for the proposed new stadium asset.

I remain open-minded and, of course, this is a decision for another day should the order pass through the other place, but I emphasise the onus is on the government to answer the questions openly and transparently. It needs to urgently establish and commit to budget reform to ensure the project won't diminish the economic welfare of Tasmania should it proceed. Certainly, it's clear that the revenue boost that Tasmania needs will not come from dividends from government-owned businesses, as the Auditor-General's report made clear yesterday, as these two are on a downward trend.

The Auditor  General's media release about his report to parliament, Volume 2 of the 'Report to Parliament on the Audit of Financial Statements of State Entities and Audited Subsidiaries of State Entities for the years ended 31 December 2024 and 30 June 2025' said:

… 2024-25 was a challenging year for the financial performance of Tasmanian government businesses. Compared to 2023-24, underlying profit was down $136.21 million. Direct support increased by $52.84 million and equity contributions increased by $114.33 million. Returns to the government, dividends and other, were $38.09 million lower, and borrowings increased by $771.56 million. The significant increase in borrowings in 2024-25 followed increases in previous years, and together with additional planned borrowings over coming years, servicing this level of debt will place further pressure on the profitability of PNFCs. [TBC]

The Auditor-General's media release goes on to say:

We have observed interest expense increase from $115.93 million in 2022-23 to $209.87 million in 2024-25. With the growing level of borrowings in the foreseeable future, interest expense will continue to rise, further impacting PNFC's ability to generate an underlying surplus, reduce reliance on government support and equity contributions, and provide a return to government. [TBC]

I note also in the report and the media release, the Auditor-General noted significant matters, including the fact that, in the Auditor-General's opinion, when he issued his audit report on 19 August 2025, it was in his opinion that TT-Line was insolvent: certainly concerning news to hear from the Auditor-General.

In closing, right now, I know that we're simply noting this Budget. I've only touched on one particular area around sport and recreation, and I will certainly do my job in scrutinising the Budget further over the coming week and asking questions of ministers in Estimates next week, but based on my read so far, this is not a budget that enables future generations to inherit opportunity and stability. They deserve better. Future generations deserve a government that will take responsibility for the financial mess that we're in and take urgent and meaningful action to do something about it; not because it's politically popular, but because it's what's in the best interest of Tasmanians. Not because it will win them another term; but because it's in the best interest of the state. 

I'm sad to say that I'm not confident this government is taking meaningful action on reform. I'm not convinced that it will. I'm very worried about what that means for future generations, so it's with a heavy heart I note the Budget.

[3.45 p.m.]
Mr HISCUTT (Montgomery) -  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=19.4_D=0.8_C=0.17]  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=22.0_D=9.0_C=0.74]  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=38.0_D=13.9_C=0.85] Mr President, I preface this speech by saying that this is my first budget reply, and I enjoyed listening to those who have presented many over the years. Their insights are invaluable. I've enjoyed the contribution so far and look forward to those to come.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=53.2_D=24.5_C=0.80] At the outset, I acknowledge the Treasurer for delivering the 2025-26 interim Budget and for finally recognising the scale of the financial challenge facing Tasmania. For the first time in some years, we have before us a document that openly admits what some Tasmanians have known for quite some time - that our financial position is fragile, our debt levels are high and our reliance on external funding is unsustainable. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=78.3_D=4.4_C=0.70]  That recognition is, to be fair, a welcome and necessary first [Bookmark: Phr7_O=83.1_D=14.6_C=0.75]  step, but recognising a problem and solving it are two very different things. This Budget talks of discipline, restraint and of reform, but it remains to be seen whether the government has the resolve to turn these words into actions.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=98.5_D=5.4_C=0.91] I'll speak firstly to the items in Budget Paper No. 1 and then to some of the contributions in Budget Paper No. 2. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=105.0_D=12.7_C=0.84]  The Treasurer tells us the state will move towards a small surplus within the forward Estimates period. That is a worthy aspiration, but with respect, I will believe it when I see it. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=118.6_D=28.2_C=0.77]  This is not cynicism for cynicism's sake; it is based clearly on the evidence before us. The 2025-26 underlying net operating balance presented in this Budget is $574 million worse than what was forecast only a year ago, as shown on page 12 of Budget Paper 1. In other words, within the space of 12 months, the fiscal position has deteriorated by more than half-a-billion dollars.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=147.5_D=9.4_C=0.75] While the Treasurer's projections of a return to surplus might look neat in a graph or a headline, Tasmanians have every right to question whether those numbers can be achieved in practice. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=157.6_D=29.2_C=0.85]  If the forward Estimates of last year could be so dramatically revised downwards, what confidence can we have that this new set of Estimates will fare any better? Budgets are, after all, statements of priorities, and this one reads more like a statement of hope. 

The Budget proposes the establishment of the efficiency and productivity unit within the Department of Treasury and Finance. In principle, that is a sound idea. No-one would oppose sensible measures to ensure public money is being spent effectively [Bookmark: Phr13_O=187.3_D=9.1_C=0.82] . The concern is that too often these sorts of initiatives create additional costs and bureaucracy before they ever deliver savings. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=197.1_D=7.6_C=0.83]  The government must ensure that this new unit does not cost more, when it operates, than it manages to save. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=205.4_D=8.1_C=0.87]  Efficiency is not achieved by writing new reports or hiring more consultants. It is achieved by making better decisions and by setting clearer priorities.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=214.4_D=9.5_C=0.81] We also hear talk of the need to 'right-size' the public sector. Again, that is not an unreasonable objective, but it is one that must be handled carefully. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=224.8_D=13.6_C=0.79]  Tasmania relies heavily on its public sector for the delivery of essential services, particularly in our regions. 'Right-sizing' must not become a euphemism for hollowing-out frontline staff or under-resourcing key agencies [Bookmark: Phr18_O=239.3_D=20.5_C=0.79] . I note the concerning evidence on page 97 of the Budget papers where last year's employee expenses were significantly misbudgeted by some $335 million. That misstep raises a serious question about the government's capacity to project, manage and control its largest single cost category - its workforce. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=260.8_D=7.2_C=0.83]  If employee expenses cannot be forecast accurately, then all other saving targets begin to look a lot more like guesswork than strategy.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=269.1_D=27.5_C=0.78] Turning to the broader economic assumptions underpinning this Budget, on page 17 we are told that growth is expected in the Tasmanian economy over the forward Estimates. That sounds encouraging, but one must ask, on what grounds? Is it driven by genuine productivity gains in the private sector, by an expansion of our export base, or is it simply assumed, because the forward Estimates need to show some positive trajectory?

 [Bookmark: Phr21_O=297.4_D=3.4_C=0.41] I would also like to question the Budget's modelling towards the interstate migration [Bookmark: Phr22_O=301.8_D=2.4_C=0.72]  trending towards zero over the forward period, as shown on chart 2.23 on page 43. Apart from during COVID years, we have seen a relatively stable number of net interstate migration from Tasmania. I want to know what factors the government expects to change that will bring this back to nearly zero. This is a question I would like the Leader to give an answer to, if possible.

It is not enough to simply say that growth will occur. Growth must be underpinned by credible policy, by workforce participation, by infrastructure investment that improves efficiency, and by private sector confidence. Those factors are not clearly demonstrated in the in the budget papers.

Now, we come to debt. Tasmania's gross debt per capita is now well above the government's own target, sitting at around $23,000 for every man, woman and child in the state. That figure alone, shown on page 53, should give us all pause. This doesn't include the government's defined superannuation liability either, and there is no clear path to a solution.

We also learn that borrowings for public non-financial corporation sector entities poses a major and growing risk to the state's balance sheet. When these entities borrow, often with implicit government backing, the risk ultimately rests with the taxpayer. It is one thing to borrow for the productivity investment. It is another to borrow simply to maintain operations or to service past decisions. While the Treasurer tells us that new savings will be achieved through changes to office leases, procurement, marketing and communications at various points in the Budget, there is precious little detail about what these savings actually entail. Tasmanians deserve transparency, not slogans. We should know which leases, which contracts and which programs are being reduced or restructured. Such volatility makes accurate forecasting difficult and further undermines confidence in the underlying numbers.

The Budget tells us that nearly all the fiscal strategy measures are currently beyond their targets. Yet, somewhat paradoxically, it also projects an increase in general government own-source revenue as a percentage of total expenditure, as shown on page 61. This graph looks remarkably optimistic. If revenue is to rise, we're entitled to ask, from where? Is the government assuming higher returns from state-owned businesses? Clearly not. Increased fees and charges? Again, no. Is it counting on continued population-linked Commonwealth funding through the GST? The Budget paper does not provide a convincing answer.

I will acknowledge one positive element. It seems that, after the major capital works associated with TT-Line and TasNetworks are completed, the government does at least anticipate a period of restraint in new major spending for government business enterprises, though we shall see.

This will be important if we are to restore some sustainability to our capital program.  [Bookmark: _Hlk213776216] The elephant in the room remains our dependence on the federal government. GST revenues account for around 67 per cent of Tasmania's total revenue base. This is an extraordinary level of reliance on the Commonwealth - one that leaves this state exposed to decisions made in Canberra and beyond our control.

In effect, we have built a budget model that depends on the generosity of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. A small change in relativity, a national downturn, or a shift in federal priorities could shift hundreds of millions of dollars from Tasmania's bottom line. Yet this Budget offers no serious plan to broaden the state's own revenue base or to build greater self-reliance. It is simply assumed that the Commonwealth will continue to come to the rescue. That assumption is not a fiscal strategy. It is a gamble.

Fiscal responsibility should not mean that we shut up shop and do nothing. In fact, there are some very worthwhile initiatives in the Budget, I will highlight a few that affect the beautiful region of Montgomery. It is pleasing to see support for the unique experiences in the Dial Range. Those who might have spent the weekend with their heads down in the Budget paper may, in future years, find some time away afterwards to relax and walk some of these accessible tracks that will be created under this initiative. These walks and tracks draw tourists from around Australia and the world, and alongside the mountain biking experiences are exciting opportunities for our region.

Ms O'Connor - Eco-tourism.

Mr HISCUTT - That's right. 

Mr President, Camp Clayton is another area which will receive some benefit in this Budget. I can attest to the value this brings to the region, as my own daughter attended there for her grade 4 camp about three weeks ago. The benefit it provides to the broader community is incredible, and the experience is like no other. Camp Clayton has been providing camping and adventure programs for over 70 years and it's a great spot for both school and adult retreats or conferences.

The Central Coast Council has done a lot of work in providing a compelling business case to the government for master planning for its waterfront area. I'm pleased to see that this has been continued to be provided within this Budget. This will boost visitation to the area and engage the community within that space.

Other initiatives covered under this line item include some much-needed infrastructure at the East Ulverstone Football Club rooms, and they have recently started a new Auskick club within that club.

On the western end of the electorate is the stunning Emu Valley Rhododendron Garden. It is fitting that the government has seen to assist this space, as it provides untold visitations to Tasmania and the region. As with all organisations, they are suffering from volunteer shortages and burnout, and this line item will provide the support they require to service the region.

I am disappointed to see the reduction in funding for the Dial regional sports complex. I recognise the reasoning and intent behind this funding change, but would encourage the government to investigate the broader precinct and recognise that the funding that is being cut will affect the new change rooms proposed for oval B. This will mean a continuation of the current situation requiring the women's teams relying on asking the men to look away while they change between their cars. I hope the government takes note of the situation and looks to help to remedy it soon. I trust that the Leader or the Minister for Sport will pass the message along. These are some of our elite players using this ground, and it showcases ourselves to the nation. We need to do better than that. 

I am pleased to see that the funding that's been committed is sufficient to bring oval A up to a Tier 4 standard, and I look forward to watching professional-level sports at this ground soon.

I would like to see - as the member for Elwick mentioned - grants put aside for sporting clubs. For example, the Turners Beach Football Club has insufficient lighting on the ground, meaning much of the ground cannot be trained on during the winter months. If it is trained on, then the expectation of a missed ball and a broken finger or other bone is heightened, potentially affecting our health system and seeing players out of work. There are many similar experiences of this across the state, I am sure.

Users of the Penguin Sports & Services Club will be happy to see that they have still been included as well, with renovations planned that will assist the club. This club harmoniously hosts many different organisations, including the RSL, the Bowls Club, the Golf Club, and many more.

There are some pleasing items in this Budget that affect all our regions, too, and I would especially like to note the Variety breakfast program. We all know that a full belly makes for a happier and more consistent student, less interruptions and better learning outcomes. Not everyone needs this facility, but for those that do, it will mean the world. Our concerning financial position does not mean that we need to do nothing, just that we need to justify and consider all our actions and spendings.

I will conclude where I began. There is merit in the fact that this Budget at least acknowledges the depth of Tasmania's fiscal challenge. It sets the stage for reform, but it does not yet deliver it. The words 'efficiency', 'discipline' and 'productivity' appear frequently in the Treasurer's speech, but words alone will not repair the Budget. Tasmania needs credible projections, transparent accounting and a genuine strategy for reducing debt and dependency. We cannot continue to rely on optimistic forecasts, creative accounting and the goodwill of the Commonwealth to balance our books. We must be honest with Tasmanians about the choices ahead. We cannot spend indefinitely, borrow indefinitely, and hope that someone else will pay the bill.

Yes, I welcome the admission that there is a problem, but recognition is only the first step. The test of this government will be whether it can turn that recognition into a disciplined, transparent and realistic plan to restore Tasmania's financial strength, not in theory, but in practice.

Mr President, I note the Budget Papers.

[3.59 p.m.]
Ms ARMITAGE (Launceston) - Mr President, here we are looking at yet another budget this year, and it doesn't seem like all that much has really changed when it comes to our short-, medium- and long-term economic outlooks.

Resumed from above.

[4.30 p.m.]
Ms ARMITAGE (Launceston) - Mr President, here we are looking at yet another budget this year and it doesn't seem like all that much has really changed when it comes to our short, medium and long-term economic outlooks. In fact, it is very alarming.

It's easy to brush off a cynical and pessimistic view of our state's finances, but I don't believe it does justice to the actual raw numbers we see before us. It doesn't do justice to our children and their children who will inherit the economic mess that will pursue them in the years to come. They are disadvantaged enough already.

It doesn't help to be in denial about our state's finances or the numbers that we can clearly see in the Budget today and the forward Estimates, and I don't believe that this is catastrophising either. I believe we need to take an analytical and objective approach to the Budget and think long and hard about what we can afford, about what's fair and about good investments.

I understand why people are becoming so disengaged from politics, policy and the democratic process. From the Spirits to the stadium, the state of the health system, our education system and its staff, the government is fighting countless fires and it's affecting how the rest of Australia sees us and how Tasmanians see themselves.

The government continues to dig deep and deeper into financial messes without having any exit plans in place. In his budget speech, the Treasurer said they were confident and convinced that Tasmania's future continues to be bright.

I truly want this to be the case, and I will give credit where credit's due, but the numbers don't and can't lie. In October, Tasmania dropped to sixth place in the CommSec State of the State report due to an anaemic private sector demand and softer outcomes in household spending, population growth and economic output. I note this report emphasised that Tasmania had the strongest job market, but very importantly also noted that the state ranked eighth on annual grown as it was being held back by a slowing public investment and a shift towards budget repair. The situation is likely to get worse before it can get any better.

The State of the State report also emphasised the fact the Tasmanian housing market needed improvement, particularly in the building of houses, and that doing so would be integral to lifting the state's performance. Unfortunately, the state has performed poorly on that score. The Homes Tasmania annual report released earlier this month noted they delivered 1540 social and affordable homes towards a target of 10,000 by 2032.

The wait list for housing is thousands long with 5336 applicants as of September 2025 - the highest ever - with an average wait time of around 82 weeks for placement. This continues an extremely worrying trend of the number of applicants needing social housing year on year since 2021. The need for secure housing continues to grow and it seems like there's absolutely no solution in sight. According to the TasCOSS dashboard. I quote: 

Demand for social housing has grown significantly over the last decade and is outstripping new supply, as reflected in continued growth in the social housing wait list. Tasmania's wait time for social housing for greatest need households is now the second highest in Australia after the Northern Territory.

This lengthy waiting period is putting financial, practical, relationship and emotional strain on many Tasmanians who urgently need access to safe, affordable and appropriate housing. [TBC]

The dashboard further notes that waiting for housing affects people's health and wellbeing [Bookmark: Phr2_O=7.2_D=11.1_C=0.76] , their safety, and is described by people as horrible, demoralising, traumatic, nerve-racking, tiring, dreadful, disappointing and soul-destroying [Bookmark: Phr3_O=19.9_D=10.8_C=0.77] . It affects people's ability to safely raise a family, get education, find meaningful work, contribute to society and feel a part of a community. We are sleepwalking into a disaster. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=32.0_D=19.9_C=0.86] 

Yet public discourse is overwhelmingly concerned with large amounts of capital expenditure on projects which people can't really believe are being prioritised. I do believe the government can walk and chew gum at the same time. That is to say that you can fund and pursue big projects while also looking after the basics [Bookmark: Phr5_O=52.5_D=11.8_C=0.85] , but we have too many expensive capital projects coming up with an ever-growing urgent need for those basics - health, housing and education - going underfunded. This is just wrong.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=65.2_D=13.8_C=0.86] How do we expect a stadium, even when it's built, to be used by Tasmanians when they can't afford the basics themselves? Do we think that people in insecure housing are going to be wanting to spend their money on attending a football match or a concert [Bookmark: Phr7_O=79.7_D=5.5_C=0.80] . If trends continue, we're going to have more and more people who can't afford a safe place to live. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=86.3_D=4.0_C=0.91]  The government still cannot tell us how much the stadium is going to cost. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=91.0_D=3.0_C=0.90]  The TPC report stated and I quote:

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=94.8_D=14.6_C=0.83] There is substantial evidence that final costs are likely to be significantly greater than concept design stage costs, as has particularly been the case in recent years for major public construction projects both in Australia and overseas. [TBC]

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=110.8_D=1.3_C=0.91]  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=112.8_D=16.1_C=0.80] Is this bill the stadium at any cost, a blank cheque which leeches resources and construction capability from things like the construction of affordable and social housing, towards something whose full benefits can't really be quantified, or at least not without significant argument? [Bookmark: Phr13_O=130.8_D=11.8_C=0.81] 

Additionally, we are bailing out and extending lines of credit for already struggling organisations. In October, it was confirmed that TT-Line would receive a $75 million cash bailout [Bookmark: Phr14_O=143.2_D=3.2_C=0.89] , with the possibility of a further $25 million. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=147.3_D=12.6_C=0.85]  As noted in an editorial in the Mercury of 28 October this year, the size of this bailout raises questions about planning, accountability and the growing cost of major infrastructure projects in the state. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=160.6_D=24.1_C=0.82]  It additionally noted the costs behind this extra funding were clear, and I quote:

A major terminal project in East Devonport that's blown out from $90 million to a staggering $493 million and an early misstep in the specifications of the fenders that's now required hull strengthening work on both new vessels. [TBC]

Of course, not to forget the Auditor-General's comments on insolvency. Later in the piece it stated:

TT-Line is a public asset. If it falters, the economic flow-on effects would ripple across tourism operators, farmers, exporters and families. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=201.2_D=4.4_C=0.78]  [TBC]

It finally noted that a bailout may be the responsible decision as a result.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=206.8_D=10.2_C=0.79] I don't disagree. This is what I'm referring to when I note the madness of building things at any cost - of signing blank cheques and just assuming that everything will work out. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=218.1_D=5.1_C=0.91]  The Tasmanian people pay for this and will continue paying for this for years to come. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=223.9_D=5.0_C=0.90]  What the responsible thing to do is, I can't say. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. [Bookmark: Phr22_O=230.0_D=10.2_C=0.85]  My point remains that greater oversight, transparency, accountability, responsibility and governance is required over these organisations and processes.  [Bookmark: Phr23_O=241.1_D=4.1_C=0.87] What has been done to date clearly has not worked the way it was supposed to. [Bookmark: Phr24_O=247.8_D=19.3_C=0.83] 

Ms Forrest - That's confirmed in the PAC report today. You will notice when you get a chance to have a look at it.

Ms ARMITAGE - I will, thank you. This Budget allocates more than $3.5 billion to our healthcare system with $351.6 million for community health, $251.3 million for mental health services [Bookmark: Phr25_O=267.7_D=7.8_C=0.78] , $286 million to our emergency departments, $182.4 million for ambulance services [Bookmark: Phr26_O=276.6_D=22.6_C=0.78] , $2.5 million for The Bubble in Launceston for expanded offerings for women's health services, including antenatal care, pelvic health and gynaecological care, $20 million for digital health transformation, $4.7 million to fund the surgical robot and $4.6 million to upgrade Tasmanian rural hospital and ambulance stations.  [Bookmark: Phr27_O=300.2_D=4.1_C=0.80] Additionally, over the forward Estimates $2.54 billion, $3.59 billion and $3.699 billion will be allocated until the 2028-29 financial year. 

In the Education portfolio, the government has allocated $1.45 billion for in-school education, $225.2 million for children's services, $49 million for Libraries Tasmania, $32.7 million for early education, $1.63 million for the Commissioner for Children and Young People, and $24.7 million to fund the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement. Pleasingly, $1.3 million for the Breakfast in Schools Program is being allocated. As we all know, and has been mentioned, I believe, by the member for Montgomery: children do perform better when they have a full tummy.

Interestingly, one issue I believe I raised when the current Premier was Education minister, that I always believe takes a lot of money - and I am not sure that we can actually go backwards now - is the extension of years 11 and 12 to high schools in cities such as Hobart and Launceston. I know that has been raised with me by people as well, the fact that we have in Launceston two really good higher education options, Launceston College and Newstead College, yet we have a number of high schools that go to years 11 and 12. 

It was interesting last week talking to some of the students who came and asking their opinions on years 11 and 12, and whether they considered it was worthwhile. Without exception, the students I spoke to said no, they would not stay at the school, and it was a really good thing for you to be pushed that little bit, to change from the current high school you are going to, to a college. 

The other issue is the difficulty in getting experienced teachers in the high schools, when the colleges have difficulty themselves, particularly in getting science teachers and other specialised teachers. It has been an issue that I have raised time and time again, generally at Estimates with previous Education ministers, and I probably will raise it again in Estimates coming up. It is an area that I don't think is working all that well from the statistics that we see. I am sure many of the students are very happy to go to the colleges, particularly in the cities. I certainly understand why we do it in country areas, but cannot understand why we do it in the city areas.

The Budget has also allocated $125,000 to the 26Ten literacy program, but has not indicated any funding in the forward Estimates. I implore the Treasurer, the Premier and the Education minister to ensure that funding for literacy help for our community's most vulnerable people is funded. It would be a very sad outcome indeed if we lost this organisation which helps to coordinate, educate and train people to better use and understand words and numbers.

Unfortunately, there has been quite worrisome discontent amongst our health and education workers, which is not a good sign. Just looking at the Health KPIs, I note that the target for patients admitted through the ED in four hours was 60 per cent, but the actual was 9.8 per cent seen within four hours. The target for mental health patients admitted through the ED within eight hours was 90 per cent; the actual was 23.5 per cent. The target for elective surgeries seen on time was 95 per cent, but the actual was 65 per cent. I think everyone knows, particularly those that have been in health, including the member for Murchison, someone in this House who has certain health experience, that the sooner you have surgery or the sooner you actually treat a condition, the better outcome you get. 

It is a bit like the emergency department; you're going with an issue or maybe you're going on a waiting list and be seen, then you're going to have a far better outcome than if you go into emergency, which takes much longer to recover and often has a much worse outcome. I know how much money we actually spend on health, but when you consider the outcomes for people in our community to be able to recover more quickly, it's certainly money well spent. The other target, waiting beyond recommended times for elective surgery: the target was 270 patients; the actual number is 3282 people statewide who waited longer than recommended.

Another issue that has been raised with me was that the state's public service grew by 3.3 per cent last financial year, again defying government attempts to rein in costs by trimming numbers. There were 36,158 public sector workers in Tasmania at the end of the 2024-25 financial year, up by 1200 workers. The State Service annual report says it grew by 4.7 per cent the year before. The real concern that we have - and I've spoken to people particularly in in the area of Police, Fire and Emergency Management - is that to cut people in those areas where safety is paramount for people, it's a real concern when there's a budget cut or they have to find where they're going to cut. How do you cut money out of police, out of fire, out of emergency management? It's something that you just can't do. I have great concern over these issues.

The other area that I was reading - I won't go into all the details here because I know that other people are fairly close to being ready to speak - but the amount of money that's spent on locums. In reading some of these articles, the word is out on the mainland, 'Don't go to Tasmania, you're going to be overworked, you're going to be burnt out, so don't go and work there.' Then what do they do? They have to employ locums. The amount of money that's spent on locums, when it actually could be spent on paying our own workers to stay and get a decent wage, is pretty upsetting for most people.

I have to read these off the board because the print is too small for me when I print them out. It's the reason I do need to take a little bit more time. This is a report from Martin Goddard in the Sunday Tasmanian:

The word about working conditions in this state got around and it became harder than ever to recruit new people to replace those who'd left, so permanent staff were replaced by locum doctors and agency nurses: people whose talents were of variable quality, but who could cost three or four times as much. [TBC]

They might not even be as good as our workers, but they cost three or four times as much. In 2023-24 alone, outside doctors and nurses cost $183 million. They accounted for 21 per cent of the salary bill for doctors and 11 per cent of the bill for nurses. The extra strain on the state Budget has been remarkable. If our cost efficiency had stayed in line with the national average as it was back in 2014, the government would now be spending around $400 million less.

Costs have been increasing at almost 11 per cent a year. At that rate, the extra and avoidable hit to the Budget will be over $1 billion this financial year, and $1.4 billion by the end of the decade. All this can be fixed, but it will need a different approach. Of course, concern by the people is the approach that it might need is increasing taxes. How do you find extra money? The only way you can find extra money is by increasing taxes. I also find that's a real concern, particularly for those disadvantaged and for those struggling and now having trouble finding the money to pay their mortgages. Even public schooling, people might think it's free, but there is such a lot of cost for people with their children at school while putting food on the table.

Looking to the future, I started out talking about how we need to be looking at this Budget with a critical, analytical eye. Being realistic, pragmatic and unemotional about the state of the Tasmanian economy is vital. However, I understand that being overly and unnecessarily pessimistic is unhelpful, but so is unjustified optimism. We can't be in denial about what's in store for our state's future. Many have flagged that we should be concerned about what our next budget will look like in about six months time. We knew this was an interim Budget and that we would need to be rolling our sleeves up and making hard decisions for the 2026-27 Budget.

According to Saul Eslake, the formidable task of budget repair has been kicked down the road to the 2026-27 Budget, and further went on to state to the Mercury last week that, properly measured, Tasmania's financial position is worse than that of any other state or territory.

Saul Eslake notes that the interest on the state's debts, spending, revenue raising and paying down debt will be factors to repairing our state's finances in the shorter and longer terms. There's going to be a lot we need to do, and the longer we leave it, the worse it's going to be. Additionally, the Treasury's pre-election outlook report stated the following:[tbc]

The State Budget has a structural problem. Expenses, significantly driven by health demand and costs, are growing at a faster rate than the state's current sources of revenue.

It goes on to say:

This structural imbalance has developed over a number of years. Recent State Budgets and forward Estimates have been defined by increasing deficits and debt. As a state, we are spending more than we earn, and the gap is growing.

You may recall, I said earlier how little sense it made to me that we are signing blank cheques for major projects without any clear, defined benefit to the state, and that we are digging ourselves into debt trenches that will be extremely difficult to climb out of. It's clear that significant work is going to be required, both at the surface level and at the deeper foundational and structural levels too. To put it plainly, it certainly worries me.

A very interesting article by senior economics correspondent Shane Wright last month discusses the possible outcomes of Tasmania defaulting on its debts. Mr Wright correctly notes that Tasmania defaulting on its debts would affect every other state. Can we imagine that the federal government would allow this to occur?

What next? Would the entire state be placed into administration? Drastic, yes, but I think it's something we need to at least consider. The state's finances are truly that bad and, at this time, I don't see a clear path out of it. The Budget due to be handed down next year is going to have to contain some very serious measures indeed.

It's with a great sense of apprehension that I note the Budget.

[4.52 p.m.]
Mr HARRISS (Huon) - Mr President, it's hard to know where to start. After the rejection of the debt-fuelled May Budget led to a no-confidence motion and subsequent election, Tasmanians looking for financial leadership from the government have been disappointed again. The third Treasurer in just over a year, and no change from the disastrous dive into debt and deficit that has flooded the books with red ink.

For a second successive year, we have seen a budget blow out by hundreds of millions of dollars. This is despite the efficiency dividend announced in the 2023 Budget to save $300 million over four years, and a plan to reduce staffing to 2022 levels, which has instead seen further growth in the public service.

The result of this so-called efficiency drive was that the 2023-24 deficit, using the net operating balance, skyrocketed from a budget of $297 million to more than $1.5 billion, and the government was again unable to manage the books in 2024-25, with a budgeted deficit of $792 million blowing out to more than $1.2 billion.

I'm aware that the member for Murchison's work indicates the real black hole used in the underlying net operating balance is even worse, but even on the government's own favoured measure, the trajectory is diabolical. In just two years, the government's inability to impose any sort of fiscal discipline pumped more than $1.6 billion of red ink into the state's books, over and above the steep debt dive that was already budgeted for. Yet, according to the Treasurer, we're expected to believe that a 'glide path to surplus' is going to magically appear from the accounting wreckage somewhere down the track.

I'm tempted to think that the government, under a succession of treasurers, has adopted its budget strategy from the Jindalee Operational Radar Network operated by the Defence, Science and Technology Group. What is the Jindalee radar? I'll tell you. It spearheads Australia's bid to be the world leader in over-the-horizon radar technology. It works by bouncing high-frequency electromagnetic waves off the ionosphere to identify objects thousands of kilometres away [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.2_D=4.6_C=0.79]  and therefore invisible both to the naked eye or conventional radar.

Ms Rattray - Have you been reading Harvey's homework?

Mr HARRISS -  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=33.8_D=2.3_C=0.65] No, I don't help Harvey with his homework at all. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=37.2_D=17.6_C=0.72]  Perhaps that's the sort of over-the-horizon financial vision you need to identify the Treasurer's glide path to surplus, because on the evidence available it looks more like a high-speed drag way to more deficits and spiralling debt. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=55.8_D=6.0_C=0.89]  If you look at the budget record over the past five years, you can track the deterioration in the numbers year by year.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=62.8_D=2.8_C=0.81] Take for instance, the financial year just completed. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=66.5_D=5.9_C=0.79]  The 2021 Budget was the first to provide forward Estimates for the 2024-2025. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=72.9_D=9.8_C=0.88]  At that stage it was projecting a surplus in the net operating balance of $126.8 million. The next year it was reduced to $32.2 million [Bookmark: Phr9_O=83.5_D=9.4_C=0.86] , and in the 2023 Budget, the projected 2024-2025 result changed dramatically to a deficit of $148 million. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=93.9_D=8.1_C=0.83]  In 2024, it was degraded yet again, with the forecast at that stage a deficit of $792.8 million. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=102.7_D=1.7_C=0.76]  And this year's Budget [Bookmark: Phr12_O=105.0_D=8.0_C=0.82]  shows the 2024 results was a deficit of $1.250 billion. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=114.2_D=10.3_C=0.93]  Over the same period, net debt increased more than 10 times, from less than $460 million in 2021 to more than $5 billion as at 30 June this year.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=125.8_D=14.0_C=0.84] Despite the Treasurer's dubious claims, given this history, that we are on a glide path to surplus, the budget papers show that net debt is projected to double again to $10.4 billion by 2029 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=141.1_D=14.5_C=0.82] , and that doesn't even take into account unfunded superannuation liabilities and the rapidly rising debts of government businesses, which will push the total debt burden carried by taxpayers to around $28 billion by 2028-29.
 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=157.3_D=8.1_C=0.72] 
The state of Tasmania's public finances were laid out starkly in the independent Eslake review in August last year. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=166.5_D=8.6_C=0.69]  Mr Eslake found that despite repeated warnings from Treasury, the state's public finances had deteriorated significantly since 2018. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=175.8_D=12.3_C=0.82]  In the absence of corrective policy action, he warned that government finances would worsen further over the next decade, with continuing cash deficits rising net debt, interest payments [Bookmark: Phr19_O=189.3_D=6.1_C=0.70]  more than doubling and almost certain down grading Tasmania's credit rating, further increasing the cost of borrowing. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=198.1_D=5.7_C=0.81] 

He pointed to the basic problem, which is the government does not raise enough money to cover its spending [Bookmark: Phr21_O=204.5_D=9.0_C=0.89]  and recommended a four-to-10-year plan, including raising additional revenue to bring the budget back into balance and put it on a sustainable footing. [Bookmark: Phr22_O=215.0_D=16.9_C=0.72]  The Eslake report, which acknowledged the assistance of the past four heads of Treasury Department, concluded that the trajectory of all of the Tasmanian government's financial position is unsustainable. All of the metrics are heading in the wrong direction.

 [Bookmark: Phr23_O=232.9_D=7.5_C=0.83] The government took no notice and was quick to rule out the key Eslake measures such as revenue increase. [Bookmark: Phr24_O=241.9_D=7.5_C=0.87]  Instead, it continued to increase spending in the disastrous May Budget, which resulted in a no-confidence vote in the Premier and the state election [Bookmark: Phr25_O=251.0_D=6.2_C=0.86] . In case anyone was left in any doubt about the perilous state of finances [Bookmark: Phr26_O=257.9_D=5.6_C=0.73] , the Treasury's pre-election financial outlook, issued in June, painted the picture in black and white [Bookmark: Phr27_O=264.4_D=1.1_C=0.61] . The key findings -

 [Bookmark: Phr28_O=266.1_D=2.2_C=0.84] the state budget has a structural problem. [Bookmark: Phr29_O=269.1_D=5.0_C=0.79] 

expenses are growing at a faster rate than the state's current sources of revenue. [Bookmark: Phr30_O=274.9_D=7.0_C=0.86] 

recent state budgets and forward Estimates have been defined by increasing deficits and debt. [Bookmark: Phr31_O=282.8_D=4.1_C=0.80] 

as a state, we're spending more than we earn, and the gap is growing.

 [Bookmark: Phr32_O=287.6_D=7.4_C=0.86] This structural problem will not be resolved through future economic growth. Explicit policy choices are required. [Bookmark: Phr33_O=296.1_D=3.2_C=0.89]   [Bookmark: Phr34_O=300.0_D=4.9_C=0.88] Without interventions that move the state onto a different fiscal trajectory, net debt will continue to grow, and annual interest costs will more than treble. This will reduce the state's ability to manage economic shocks and to provide services to the community in the future. This rate of growth in debt is not sustainable, and the size of the problem will only increase if not addressed. Immediate and sustained action is needed. The budget needs to progressively move to a fiscal balance surplus that is sufficient to remove the need for additional borrowings. Maintaining significant fiscal balance surpluses will be essential if debt is to be reduced over time.

Getting to this point will require future average revenue growth to exceed average total expenditure growth and intervention to reduce the existing structural debt. A combination of revenue and expenditure measures will be required.

Currently, the State Service is larger than Tasmania can afford and is growing at a rate that is increasing employee expenses, which already represent approximately 46 per cent of operating costs. This is not sustainable.

The sale of assets to fund recurrent expenditure deficits is not prudent or sustainable. The rate of fiscal repair should aim to avoid negative shocks to the economy in an outlook of global economic uncertainty. Therefore, while regaining fiscal sustainability is achievable, it will be challenging and is expected to take sustained and disciplined action over many years. What is clear is that expenditure restraint is required, including through election periods.

Mr President, what an indictment of the government's financial management coming from its own financial gatekeeper, the Treasury. The government's response to both the Treasury and Eslake reports has been disappointing, to say the least. It has kept spending, but shows little interest and almost no action in identifying how it is going to be paid for. The action plan for the current Budget is to put it over the 'Never Never'. The government has ruled out revenue increases. It flirted with asset sales, then ruled that out, before tinkering with some minor changes to its already announced and so-far-ineffective efficiency drive.

After successive deficits of well over a billion dollars and with a third budgeted for this year, it added another 300 job cuts from back office functions to the 2500 previously announced, but with no program and no funding to deliver and no timeline to get there except a target that's set for 2032, six years away.

Perhaps most concerningly, given the massive increase in the public service under successive Liberal governments, the government has taken its hands off the wheel and handballed to the public service itself the job of deciding where these future reductions will fall as vacancies occur. That, to me, smacks of a government that refuses to take responsibility for the situation that it has itself created.

State Service workforce reports show we had less than 26,000 public servants in December 2015, and during this year there were more than 36,000. That's an increase of 1000 a year for 10 years. Despite the announcement of the public service-led plan to reduce numbers by 2500, the State Service annual report shows there was an increase of 1200 in the year to June. The current plan clearly is not working. The government put all those additional staff on and, having belatedly decided that they overdid it, the government should take responsibility for deciding where the reduction should fall. That would meet the explicit policy choices required of the corrective actions the Treasury has identified that we need, and we might get a plan with a chance of working.

Meanwhile, in the absence of a decisive action, the debt goes on climbing astronomically, and the longer we wait for the government to act, the more difficult and more damaging the required action will be.

The excuse for lack of action in this Budget offered by the Treasurer - that Labor forced the election and he hasn't had time to prepare more than an interim Budget - is ridiculous. The Liberal Party has been in power for more than 11-and-a-half unbroken years. How much time does he need?

You don't need to look far to find a more decisive example to rein in government spending. The Hodgman government was elected on 15 March 2014, ending 16 years of Labor rule. Its first budget after 16 years in the political wilderness was delivered just three months later, on 19 June. It wasn't just an interim budget; it was a financial action plan to deliver on the new government's policies and priorities. Importantly, with reference to the current budget position, it included specific action to rein in spending. That included reducing the size of the public service.

Former treasurer, Mr Gutwein, said in his second reading speech:

It's clear if we're going to put the budget back on track, then we have to address the blowout in wages. That's why we went to the election with a commitment to reduce the size of the public sector by 500 positions.

However, it was made clear in the Budget Risks report that the budget was unsustainable on current settings, and that in the absence of other savings, further reductions in excess of 1000 full-time equivalents were required. After explaining that these additional job losses had been offset by other savings plans and revenue measures, including a proposed 12-month pay pause, which didn't proceed, and $100 million special dividend from MAIB, Mr Gutwein announced the new job reduction target would be 700 positions. The government then drove the job reductions. Many people still recall the current Premier's difficulties at that time with the education workforce.

We might argue about the merits of the actions of the Hodgman government, but they did two things: they showed that the government, at that stage, was prepared to accept and act on the advice of Treasury to ensure the finances were sustainable. They certainly were in line with the current Treasury advice that to restore budget discipline, explicit policy choices are required.

Mr President, you may well recall that the reductions imposed by the Hodgman government we're really the tail end of the fallout from the global financial crisis on Tasmanian books. The principal impact was felt in 2011 when Treasury advised that the impact of the GFC would reduce revenues by $1.5 billion over three years. That was at a time when the entire Tasmanian budget was well short of $5 billion - so it was a big hit.

The Giddings government, which included the Greens, as I'm sure the member for Hobart recalls all too well, did not ignore the advice, and nor did it put off its response, until years down the track. The 2011 Budget included savings of $1.4 billion to match the revenue drop, including reducing the public service by 1700 full-time equivalents, cutting the Health budget by over half-a-billion dollars over four years and putting 20 schools on the block for closure. Those actions were part of a wider reform plan to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of key services.

Perhaps the most challenging budget situation faced by a Tasmanian government within living memory was a set of books provided by Treasury to the incoming Field government in 1989. More than 10 per cent of recurrent revenues were needed to pay debt servicing costs, and without action, Treasury was advising that the interest payments could swallow 30 per cent of the budget within a decade.

The Field government did not look for excuses to sit on its hands and watch the debts mount. It acted to address the issues. Some of the comments from the then-Premier and Treasurer offer direct lessons for us today. In his Budget speech on 4 September 1990, Mr Field, explaining how the crisis had developed, said:

By refusing to adapt to challenging financial circumstances and to take the hard decisions, the previous government had allowed the financing requirement to increase to an unsustainable level, and by failing to fund new liabilities and by laundering money off budget, it had hidden the real extent of the problem from parliament and the people of Tasmania.

Pretty prescient. We can see echoes of the Hydro laundering and the shuffling of the numbers in the forward Estimates over the recent years, both having been exposed by the forensic work of the member for Murchison. The Field government acknowledged that the budget task would not be easy [Bookmark: Phr4_O=21.1_D=4.7_C=0.87] , but undertook to address major unfunded liabilities so that the burden [Bookmark: Phr5_O=26.4_D=7.8_C=0.80]  would not fall on future taxpayers, and pledged also to share the budget task as fairly as possible right across the community.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=35.1_D=23.0_C=0.79] Unlike the current government, it did not rule out revenue increases. In fact, well over half the budget task was achieved by increasing taxes. It hit everything from payroll tax, land tax, stamp duty, the off-road diesel exemption, financial institutions duty, to casino taxes. For most people, it hit home when car registration fees were more than doubled.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=59.3_D=1.8_C=0.72] On spending, the Field government [Bookmark: Phr8_O=61.6_D=30.0_C=0.81]  shunned what it called the easy option of across-the-board cuts and instead targeted a root and branch overhaul of public services to improve efficiency and effectiveness, along with required cost reductions. This was backed by an $100 million redundancy program to cut 2000 jobs. In other words, explicit policy choices delivering immediate and sustained action, well and truly meeting the current Treasury advice on the requirements to deliver a sustainable budget [Bookmark: Phr9_O=91.7_D=1.0_C=0.90]  position.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=95.4_D=10.0_C=0.79] Contrast this to what we're presented with in the current Budget - a cash deficit which Saul Eslake says gives a more accurate picture of the state of the books [Bookmark: Phr11_O=106.2_D=2.8_C=0.85]  is $1.352 billion. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=109.6_D=12.0_C=0.78]  That follows cash deficits of $1.293 billion in 2023-24, and just a fraction under the $1.375 billion result for the 2024-25 year. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=123.4_D=29.0_C=0.79]  The three are right up there with the worst results in Tasmanian history, but the trajectory tells an even more shocking story. Two years ago, the projected cash result in forward Estimates for 2025-26 was a deficit of $412 million. Last year it had grown to an $850 million loss. This year, we're being advised it will be more than $1350 million.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=153.4_D=13.6_C=0.85] When it comes to forward Estimates for 2026-27, the cash result projected by the Treasury has grown over three budgets from a deficit of less than $190 million to $1.125 billion. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=167.7_D=3.0_C=0.90]  That would give us the fourth billion-dollar loss in a row. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=171.7_D=16.5_C=0.81]  We are drowning in debt and deficit while the government talks up what might happen down the track without taking and following through on the explicit policy decisions named up by the Treasury as essential to righting the ship of the state.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=189.7_D=14.4_C=0.88] I'm not advocating austerity. It is because I believe we should be doing everything we can to avoid austerity that we need to see some real action now, rather than the sound-bite messages coming from the 'gunnas' in government [Bookmark: Phr18_O=204.7_D=9.8_C=0.82] . You know the ones - 'We need to right-size the public service, but the time frame is 2032, and we're not going to take the hard decisions on where savings will be made. We'll leave that to the public service. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=224.9_D=9.8_C=0.85] ' You hear it repeatedly: 'We're gunna do something next year. We're gunna get it right somewhere over the horizon.' We might call it the Jindalee jingle.

 [Bookmark: Phr21_O=235.8_D=1.5_C=0.68] Meanwhile, the debts pile up [Bookmark: Phr22_O=238.2_D=10.8_C=0.83] , loading interest payments and servicing charges onto future budgets and limiting the capacity of future parliaments to address the urgent needs of the community. [Bookmark: Phr23_O=249.8_D=14.4_C=0.78]  As Saul Eslake has pointed out, when you add the public sector superannuation liability and the debts of government businesses, the total level of debt owed or guaranteed by the government will be more than $28 billion in 2028-29. [Bookmark: Phr24_O=265.0_D=15.0_C=0.83]  That is above 60 per cent of gross state product - far worse than Victoria, which until now has been regarded as the financial basket case among the states, and where the competitive debt load is around 35 per cent of gross state product.

 [Bookmark: Phr25_O=281.9_D=2.8_C=0.84] The government's claims to be addressing the disaster have been blown out of the water by Treasury's statement on performance [Bookmark: Phr27_O=294.2_D=3.6_C=0.84]  against the fiscal targets in Budget Paper 1. [Bookmark: Phr28_O=298.5_D=6.5_C=0.76]  We are meeting just two of 11 targets, and we're a mile away on the rest. In most of them, we are going backwards at a rate of knots. Having far-and-away the worst set of books in the country and going backwards from there puts us in a highly risky financial position. That is emphasised in the Treasury advice on budget risks and sensitivities. From stagnating population growth to GST distribution changes; to the difficulty of holding the Commonwealth to agreed funding formulas; to the ever-rising demand for services and cost of infrastructure; the financial alligators are all over the place.

When it comes to matters entirely within the government's control, it gets no better. The budget has been framed on a public sector wage increase of 2.5 per cent for this financial year. Treasury has pointed out that the government has already offered 3 per cent and the negotiations are ongoing. That means the government has been blown from the start.

In addition, Treasury is waving red flags over the government's capacity to deliver even the minimal saving measures that it has adopted so far. The only new saving measures for this year in the Budget are designed to reduce the deficit by just $5.9 million this year, and $11.9 million thereafter. In other words, just a drop in the ocean of accumulating debt. Somehow, the government wants us to believe this will power a financial turnaround to the extent we will have a budget surplus of $5.6 million in 2028-29.

As Mr Eslake has observed, the projection is based on a real terms decline in total operating expenses of 9.4 per cent over three years, from July next year. Over the same three years, the rate of increasing spending on health will need to be slashed by more than 80 per cent rising no more than 1.4 per cent a year, compared to an average increase over the past 10 years of 8.5 per cent. To say that is unlikely, given the government's history of reckless spending year after year is putting it mildly.

Saul Eslake reminds us that to pay for the worst financial mess in the country, we have the worst performing economy of any state. We are the poorest state in the country, with per capita gross state product more than 26 per cent below the national average. We pay 27 per cent less income tax than other Australians, and our income is supported by Social Security benefit payments, which are 33 per cent above the national average. In a real sense, we are the welfare state, in a position underscored by the fact the proportion of revenues raised from our own state taxes and charges has fallen below 30 per cent in this budget. That makes it absolutely essential that our public services are efficient, effective and deliver full value to the people who need them.

Unfortunately, that is not where we are. We have been throwing money at the health system, but the results coming out remain stubbornly problematic for far too many people. There are almost 90,000 Tasmanians on waiting lists for health and dental care. Emergency departments are busting at the seams with waiting times for treatment, often well outside guidelines.

Our education results for decades have been persistently the worst of any state. More than 5000 people are on the growing waiting list for public housing and in the meantime, according to Anglicare, there has been an 88 per cent increase in the number of people sleeping in parks, cars, doorways or on the streets.

Clearly, spending on its own is not the answer. We need better systems and that means serious reform driven from the top. Until that happens, we will continue to throw money at systems that are failing and that means no one wins. The failure to manage the Budget and the failure to manage important infrastructure projects like the Devonport Ferry Terminal have real consequences. For example, they seriously undermine the case for the AFL stadium. If we can't pay for essential services without running up repeated billion-dollar deficits, it is reasonable to ask the question: how can we afford a billion-dollar stadium? If we can't build a ferry terminal without the budget blowing out more than five times, from $90 million to $493 million and counting, with timeframes blowing out by years, how are we going to keep financial control of the much larger stadium project?

Those are reasonable questions and the government will need some convincing answers to demonstrate its claim that the stadium stacks up when the order comes before the Council.

While it's at it, this might also explain why parliament has been asked to commit to a billion-dollar stadium when one of the key end users, cricket, has not committed to use it if it's built. The heads of agreement signed by the Premier with Cricket Australia and Cricket Tasmania to work together to make the stadium work for cricket contains a specific legal disclaimer. It says: (tbc)

This document does not create any legal relationship between the parties or no legally enforceable rights or obligations arise in relation to the subject matter of this document. This document does not constitute an offer or commitment by the parties to enter into any agreement or transaction.

That disclaimer means that as as far as Cricket Australia is concerned, Tasmanian taxpayers carry all the downside risk with, at this stage, no guaranteed upside. This is a real concern when the most positive assessment of the stadium's business case, the one presented by the Coordinator-General, was based on a higher attendance for cricket than football.

We need to apply much more scrutiny to government spending. The Treasurer has described racking up huge state debt as intergenerational theft. We are living beyond our means and stealing from our children and grandchildren to pay for it. The longer it goes on, the harder and more severe the eventual correction will need to be. To borrow from the prophetic words of Michael Field all those years ago, the choice we are facing is stark. We either face up to the issues and address them in a realistic way, or they will get completely out of control, and the damage will be so much greater.

Every previous budget crisis in living memory has been sparked or heavily influenced by events beyond the control of the Tasmanian parliament. The most recent, the global financial crisis, which led to the response of the Giddings government. This time, as Saul Eslake has emphasised:(tbc)

The crisis has been caused entirely by the deliberate actions of the government in turning the taps on spending without any attention to how bills will be paid.

When operating expenses blow out by almost $500 million and the only new response is an insipid plan to save $5.9 million while we rack up cash deficits of $1.3 billion, it's time for a change of direction.

I note the Budget.

[5.23 p.m.]
Mr GAFFNEY (Mersey) - Mr President, I rise to give my thoughts on the second budget of this year and the associated Appropriation Bills (No 1 and No 2) 2025. I would like to begin by thanking all members for their efforts in both preparing and critiquing this budget and by recognising the government faces many conflicting interests, fiscal challenges and no-win decisions. I hope for those people listening at home they recognise the amount of work that members in this place are doing, looking at this issue and the budget. I have heard some wonderful speeches drawing in from their communities, drawing in from their personal thoughts and that we really do care about what we're doing here in this place, and we really are trying to do the right thing. It is really important that people understand that and it's part of our job, but there is pressure mounting out there within the community that we do the right thing, whether that's for or against the stadium build. What we're doing here today is talking about the budget and that's what I'm going to focus on. I am only going to focus on three or four points and not going to go into other areas that some have.

We need to be able to bring Tasmania to where it needs to be and to best benefit Tasmanians, the government must take decisive action and ensure it stays on the best path forward. I also appreciate the budget speech contributions from other members, and will focus on three or four main points.

When I considered the previous budget, I viewed it as an optimistic continuation of various radical changes it had proposed with the potential to alter the state of Tasmania's finances for years to come. While many of the more radical proposals were scaled back, it was not necessarily a responsible budget, nor one that reflected the ongoing structural reform to government spending that is so necessary for Tasmania to thrive.

This Budget again seems to me as a substantial continuation of the status quo, rather than adapting and moving away from the budget that sent Tasmanians back to the polls at great cost both financially and in political capital. It seems that many of the same criticisms of that budget remain. Of course, this is an interim Budget which the Treasurer himself notes was created in a significantly compressed timeframe. I appreciate the comment from the member for Huon regarding the Hodgman government when they had three months to provide a full budget.

I recognise that the timeframes within which this Budget was created constrain the government from making legitimate attempts to provide adequate reform that is both well thought out and realistic. With that said, this Budget presented itself as an opportunity for the government to both lay the groundwork and make clear its intentions and expectations for the future of Tasmanian finances. In some ways, the government has utilised this opportunity, noting the state's problematic debt, the challenging economic environment, and the need for future investment. 

As I mentioned earlier, these are conflicting requirements which need decisive management and must be approached with utmost care. In this regard, I recognise the stated budget priorities by the government as essential services, budget sustainability and infrastructure investment, as well as the recognised need for long-term reform. The government will also provide some items that will be of benefit to rural Tasmania and Tasmanians more generally, for example: the TasPorts investment into the Strait Link deal, noting, of course, this comes against the backdrop of the ongoing Spirit of Tasmania fiasco.

In other ways, I believe the government has missed the mark. This Budget is undeniably optimistic about the state's finances, with what the Treasurer refers to as 'realistic optimism' in his budget speech. I must question whether optimism is the baseline with which a responsible government should approach a fiscal situation such as Tasmania's. I note that respected economist Saul Eslake has stated that the economic situation in Tasmania is dire and while the interim Budget is less worse than the previous budget, it still fails to address the major issues in Tasmanian finances. 

Following this train of thought, is it truly in the best interest of Tasmanians to take optimistic figures of current debt at face value, while our repayment instalments cost the state millions and risk our credit ratings; making optimistic projections about the revenue generation of Tasmania while imposing spending cuts; or making optimistic predictions on reducing government spending while we commit ourselves to likely over a billion dollars of spending on a stadium?

Of the interest groups I've heard from on this Budget, many are stating the same thing: that the government is not doing enough. Meanwhile, the economists I have heard on this Budget all state that while the government faces no easy way out, it needs to act. Reading that in the context of the government's proposed Budget, I feel that one can only draw the conclusion that the government does not have its priorities in order. 

While we are focusing on spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a stadium, we hesitate to commit ourselves to structural reform, much-needed investment and responsible governmental spending. In short, it seems that the government is failing to to prioritise the needs of Tasmanians while relying on unrealistically optimistic spending, revenue and growth projections to inform its path to budget surplus. 

On 7 November I was one of several members who participated in the interim Tasmanian Budget information session presented by the Tasmanian Council of Social Service, known as TasCOSS. Both the CEO of TasCOSS, Adrienne Picone, and a member for the Tasmanian Policy Exchange at the University of Tasmania, Dr Robert Hortle, gave insights to the spending trends, implications of the budget and potential policy solutions to address budgetary pressures while meeting the needs of industry. One of the things I am going to focus on is that the TasCOSS information session provided a clear analysis of the Budget, from which one thing was certain: the Tasmanian government has, in this Budget, deferred budget repair, failed to invest in the necessary measures to lift people out of poverty, prioritising risky job cuts from the public sector while failing to secure the robust structural investment needed to ensure Tasmania thrives.

TasCOSS noted that the budget did not contain the feared deep cuts to budgetary measures supporting Tasmanian communities and industries. This, of course, is welcome; but instead the government is not prioritising investment measures to promote strength and resilience in the Tasmanian community and industry. In failing to do so, the government is shifting the cost of managing crisis to the private sector as well as to the community organisations. Moreover, it is increasing the cost of managing community welfare and will, in the long run, cost the government more than it would if the government provided adequate budgetary measures in the first instance.

I will also take this time to note the comments of Dr Robert Hortle from the Tasmanian Policy Exchange. Speaking to the framing of the Budget by the minister, Dr Hortle mentioned that it was built on 'heroic assumptions'. This supports my earlier point regarding unrealistic optimism in the Budget. Instead of responsibly approaching the deficiencies within the Tasmanian fiscal situation, the government prefers to bury its head in optimistic numbers and unrealistic assumptions.

Dr Hortle also noted the risks that come with reducing the public sector workforce, given that Tasmania has traditionally had much of its economic activity driven by state government employment. I was interested to see the suggestion that the government looked towards preventative investment in its budgetary practices. This concept is especially prevalent in the healthcare space, where holistic supports of Tasmanian health needs lead to better health outcomes and less strain and expense from the direct healthcare system. Of course, it is also important in other areas of government spending, such as in the economy or to ensure adequate housing.

The Youth Network of Tasmania's budget response matched this sentiment, calling for investment in young people as the future of Tasmania and innovation to support growth. In the same theme, it seems to me that the government has failed to acknowledge the plight of vulnerable and disadvantaged Tasmanians in their Budget this year. I note there was no gender snapshot provided, and the minister's speech failed to acknowledge the significant challenges facing certain Tasmanian demographics.

The budget speech did not mention poverty or homelessness once and fails to reassure the government's commitment to ensuring vulnerable Tasmanians are looked after. I was also provided some commentary from Shelter Tasmania, the peak body for housing in Tasmania, in their response to the 2025 state Budget media release. They note that while they support the Tasmanian Housing Strategy 2023-2043, the underlying sentiment of the statement to me was that the funding to support vulnerable and homeless Tasmanians and to stop growing housing inequality was simply not there. It concerns me that the government has consistently failed to deliver long-term economic solutions to the lack of affordable housing and the shelter for vulnerable Tasmanians. 

In the interim report the Treasurer did focus on the stadium build, so I suppose I must go there. Before I do that: if the stadium is to go ahead, what is the government going to do about the desperate shortage of affordable housing? A consequence of the project will be immediate vacuum that will draw in every applicable trade from Tasmania and the mainland to rush to get it built. What we'll see instead is a desperate shortage of skilled trades for ongoing housing construction. Those that are available naturally expect higher rates to compete with the stadium rates. The results will be higher building costs and house prices in an already overcooked sector.

There are several significant infrastructure projects on the mainland which are also attracting trades. I did read an article where 1058 tradies will be needed for the Macquarie Point build. In the same speech the Treasurer said:

We remain committed to delivering 10,000 new homes before 2032, with over $600 million budgeted to achieve this target.

The Treasurer also made the comment in his speech:

The eyes of Australia, in some cases the world, are on us to see if we have the ambition, the courage and the capacity to lay hold of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

I agree there are many mainlanders and international eyes on Tasmania. For a long time, they were basking in our fine foods, our wine, our fresh air, and a reputation for a beautiful place to visit. Indeed, our gender laws, our expungement laws and voluntary assisted dying laws are all world class and in the eyes of the world, we were turning Tasmania. 

Then we had the Spirit debacle, the state that ordered some larger ships to help get tourism and freight to our ports. We are the state which forgot to build the ferry ports big enough to cater for the ships. Now, instead of being admired as a progressive, innovative and attractive place to live, work, play and visit, unfortunately, Tasmania is now being looked upon as a bit of a joke.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=25.0_D=24.6_C=0.80] In fact, underfunding of some of our justice and forensic and integrity entities have also internationally exposed us to suggest that Tasmania is a corrupt and scandal-ridden place to be. I recently had some friends from the mainland who were absolutely gobsmacked with Macquarie Point stadium project. They could not believe that the state is heading down that path. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=50.2_D=17.3_C=0.74]  They identified and recognised the jewel of which Hobart is currently admired and cherished, and mentioned the costume jewellery of the sparkly stadium is not going to be the economic saviour of Tasmania. Indeed, most economists have suggested otherwise. 

My second major focus [Bookmark: Phr5_O=68.1_D=24.8_C=0.78]  in examining the Budget papers - and I apologise to members for going back there - I find no mention of funding for an online Voluntary Assisted Dying (VAD) portal. I've mentioned this recently in this place, when I made mention of a GP who was walking away from the VAD process. A portal is needed to support the administrative protocol for medical practitioners and pharmacists that helps people navigate the VAD process. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=93.6_D=3.8_C=0.66]  

I receive ongoing feedback from GPs about the challenges they face [Bookmark: Phr7_O=98.1_D=13.6_C=0.78]  in helping people work through the administrative burden. One is a required part of the End-of-Life Choices (Voluntary Assisted Dying) Act 2021. It's reached the stage where GPs trained in VAD protocols are stepping back with others reluctant to step up. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=112.4_D=19.8_C=0.81]  That's not because they don't want to; it's due to a variety of factors. Uppermost it's the time it takes to do the paperwork. The THS is using smart Adobe pdf forms, but they consume hours of extra time with e-mails to and fro. With multiple patients, it becomes even a bigger burden to ensure everything is done correctly.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=133.1_D=6.5_C=0.76] The recent changes to bulk billing can leave GPs seriously out of pocket by taking on this work. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=140.1_D=13.7_C=0.75]  I know the review is about examining a range of factors relating to the operation of the act, but this is an immediate need. The online administrative portal already exists in other states and can be available here with minimal effort with the Government's support. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=154.4_D=5.5_C=0.85]  Please, can the Government address this with the same degree of urgency as it's attached to the stadium?

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=160.5_D=24.6_C=0.73] I should remind members and listeners of the voice of a VAD practitioner who has recently walked away. He said:

I've been working in the VAD space since November 2022. I led the THS VAD service for two years, and when I left the role, I had supported, either as a primary medical practitioner or consulting medical practitioner, over 21 per cent of Tasmanian applicants. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=185.9_D=5.0_C=0.69]  The lack of a portal is a significant blocker to Tasmanians accessing VAD. [TBC]
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=191.7_D=28.5_C=0.76] 
He says: 

The smart Adobe forms are (1) not smart, and (2) consume hours of extra time with all the e-mails to and fro.

More importantly, he said:

The Adobe forms were the sole reason I have stepped back from any PMP work when I left the VAD clinical role. Seeing one patient at a time is challenging enough. Having multiple patients going through the VAD journey, the Adobe forms are a significant burden. [TBC]

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=221.2_D=9.7_C=0.74] Mr President, I've listened to, and closely scrutinised, the November 2025 Budget. As far as I can see, there is no funding allowance or opportunity for a VAD portal. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=231.3_D=30.0_C=0.74]  I felt as though I presented a sound case. For about an outlay of $1.7 million, Tasmanians could have a VAD portal up and running. Indeed, I was somewhat hopeful when I realised the government must have sufficient funds, because 18 months ago they announced their centre of excellence for football to be $65 million, then a few months later it was increased to $110 million, and I believe it's now $130 million. Yet we can't find $1.7 million to support the  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=261.5_D=2.2_C=0.56] End-of-Life Choices (Voluntary Assisted Dying) Act 2021.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=264.8_D=29.3_C=0.78] I hope that if a family member, friend or constituent needs a VAD medical team in the future that we have the services and the option available. I know that over 250 Tasmanian families have very much appreciated that their loved one had the chance to end intolerable suffering at a time and place of their choosing, surrounded by loved ones. Even just today, I received an e-mail from a man recognising the work [Bookmark: Phr19_O=294.4_D=4.2_C=0.62]  this parliament had done where a friend of his was able to access the act.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=299.8_D=5.2_C=0.72] Mr President, loath as I am to come back to raise the spectre of the stadium, I feel I have no choice. It's almost as if common sense has left the debate, to be replaced by enthusiastic groups thinking where any alternative views should be shot down in defence of the AFL dream. 

I still come back to Darryl Kerrigan's infamous 'tell him he's dreaming' response to a totally unrealistic suggestion from his local council. In this case, it's the insistence of the Premier, his government and the ever-loyal Labor opposition in name only, that we must spend well over a billion dollars of public money on a third stadium, this one to be shoehorned into the Hobart CBD. To use another line from The Castle: 'It breaks the law of bloody common sense.'

As a lifelong participant in a variety of sports - at a community, league and masters level - I'm keenly aware of the value of sport. With over 600 to choose from in our country, there's something out there for everyone. I will take the opportunity to remind members of how many people play AFL across the nation. The AFL proudly boasts that in 2024, it reached an all-time record of 528,000 participants across all junior, youth and senior programs, including Auskick. That's up by 2000 since 2023, which is great. It's a healthy number. Yet, if we look at the truly international sport of round football, we see a vastly different picture.

In 2024, Football Australia's national participation report highlighted the record growth in participation levels across grassroots and community football to 1,911,539 participants. The increase of 11 per cent was driven by the legacy of FIFA Women's World Cup, Australia and New Zealand in 2023, and the ongoing success of the CommBank Matildas and Subway Socceroos.

Yet it's almost as if AFL is seen as the one true and quintessential Australian sport, which it was. I can understand how this is so, as historically, AFL has been a core part of our own local history with the local generations of families in every local village or small town having its own team. Sadly, those days are now remembered in nostalgic photos shared on Facebook by local history groups. Family names still resonate and forgotten faces in the team photos look to the groups for the names to remember them by. On the west coast of Tasmania they had six really good teams, seconds. Now they have two, and one of those will fold soon. 

Times have changed. Modern-day Tasmania sees round ball football, or soccer, as the champions of participation, with 31,278 Tasmanians taking part in all forms of that sport and ever-growing numbers from word-of-mouth referrals. A perfect example in the area that I'm in is that in Devonport, we have over 1100 boys and girls as combined teams in the Devonport Junior Soccer Association. A big part of this is the open camaraderie and it's a non-contact sport, with strong volunteer support. Well, non-contact to a certain degree, but when you compare it to AFL, it definitely is.

Back to the AFL - according to the Mercury, the thought of a Tasmania Devils AFL entry has seen participation across all the AFL Tasmanian programs skyrocket by 27 per cent in 2024 over 2023 - which is great - to 21,002. That is still less than two-thirds of those playing soccer.

It's notable to see the AFL keenly publicise percentage gains in its media releases and bashful about quoting the real numbers on the ground. If we add to the massive publicity and merchandise campaign that's come with the Devils team, it's no wonder there's been a boost. Just imagine what this would do for every other community sport in Tasmania - they would all be thrilled to have billions of dollars made available to them.

Football Tasmania has ambitious plans for the future of soccer, with a plan for the home of football, which will support football to grow in Tasmania, from the grassroots right through to the elite. The proposed $80 million facility includes six full-size pitches, three synthetic and three turf, plus four 5-a-side pitches for all levels of community and elite football, as well as state-of-the-art women's and men's change rooms and training facilities. There are four times as many people in Australia playing soccer compared to football, and we want to put our money into a $1.3 billion or $1.5 billion football stadium that 30 years from now will not be attracting the same number of spectators as something like soccer would.

In AFL terms, the $80 million only gets about halfway to buying a training centre of excellence facility, small beer in the government's AFL ambitions. If we throw in the thought of a professional A-league soccer team that, like the JackJumpers, would be mostly funded with private business sponsors, we have a chance to engage at the highest national and international levels and at a much lower cost than the wants of a billion-dollar AFL team. If we had a 12,000 indoor, closed stadium, somewhere where you could have your conference centres and whatever, attracting 11 games of soccer, 11 or 12 games of basketball, and even more than that, we could attract the Opals, the Boomers, the A-League teams - and we could have our own A-League team here in Tasmania. To me, that's the sport, the vision, for the future. I believe we need to be 100 per cent certain what we're doing in this space.

If we take the Premier, his Treasurer and government's perspective on the value that will come to Tasmania from spending hundreds of millions of dollars on an AFL team and over a billion on a new stadium, how can we deny any equivalent investment and more into every other sport or recreation in Tasmania? Tasmania holds its weight well above the other states with our Olympic hockey players, with our rollers, with our cyclists, with our swimmers. There are so many other sports out there that we should be investing in to get kids off the couch.

If the team and the stadium is a no-brainer, once-in-a-lifetime investment, where's the line of private and corporate investors waving their cheque books outside the Premier's office or wanting a piece of the action? Exactly nowhere to be seen. Instead, it's down to individual members of the Tasmanian community to pay the price for this white elephant.

Stadiums have always been controversial and it's hard to know exactly where the truth lies, especially so in the case of the Macquarie Point stadium. It's why we rely on the interpretation of independent expert advisers and specialists in planning, commerce and economics. Governments and developers across the world are planning with the best of intentions as mutually beneficial partnerships. However, all too often the initial taxpayer share of the investment is given away in a fire sale as government offloads its liability for a few cents in the dollar of the original cost. 

Take, for example, the Docklands Marvel Stadium - a well-known example, built in 1996 at the modern-day equivalent of about a billion dollars. It was then sold to the AFL for $200 million 20 years later. The irony was that it was due to be given to the AFL in 2025 for a nominal $30 fee. The 2016 deal left the five AFL clubs based there millions of dollars better off with much better lease deals. That wasn't the end of it, as in 2021 it needed a $225 million redevelopment jointly funded by the AFL and Victorian government. Again, a win-win for the AFL and its clubs and more expenses for the taxpayers.

This is a stadium in the centre of Melbourne, with five AFL clubs playing around 40 games a year, and with various other sporting codes as tenants, and a venue for international acts. For the AFL, it's a huge asset that costs them only 20 cents in the dollar. Can we be assured that the Hobart stadium will not eventually have to be sold off in the same way, and maybe for far less if it can only host seven games a year with no international acts?

What is of immediate concern to me is the decision we will have to make in a few short weeks. Some of us in here and the other place have experienced acting as a planning authority in local government. A crucial part of that role is when council of elected members must act as a planning authority to make decisions on planning matters made to the council. That's what I believe we'll be considered to do now. These are decisions that rely on the reports and advice of professional planning officers, proper adherence to planning laws, codes and regulations, and a degree of local knowledge and understanding. A council that turns down an application can see the decision challenged in a Tasmanian Civil & Administrative Tribunal (TASCAT), which can also head to the Supreme Court, if needed.

We have reports by the Tasmanian Planning Commission and highly respected economists that must inform the debate and final decision. Yet the government and the opposition have completely ignored what they don't want to hear, overridden expert recommendations, and changed the process to suit their own needs. My concern about parliament acting summarily as a planning authority emphasises the need for a free vote. I'm a bit concerned that when a planning authority meets, or a divisioner meets, for an individual to arrive with a predetermined position or vote acting in a planning authority is a failure of proper process, appropriate governance and due diligence.

Dr Richard Herr, just recently speaking to members of this place, stated that the most important role of an elected member is to represent the people of Tasmania. He went on to say that in 2007:[tbc]

It has to be a conscience vote - the pulp mill debate - it ought to be a conscience vote because it is a planning authority. It is not acting as a legislative body. No one member of the parliament should be directed in any way by anyone on that decision.

When I looked at the order that we had to look at 378 pages and really appreciate the minister meeting with us to have a consultation about it, I was far out of my league to know what I was talking about. How do I know how far a building has to be away from a wall? Or how high something has to be? Or where the water has to run off? And yet, I'm the one that's got to make the decision in three weeks about that very thing because it's an order. It's outside our expertise. We work on legislation and that's it. We do not work as a planning authority and that's what we are being asked to do. I want the people of Tasmania to understand that I looked at that 378-page document and I'm saying - 'What do they want me to do with this?'

I can look at legislation. I can look at reports. I can look at recommendations from Tasmanian Planning Commission. I can look at recommendations from other august bodies in the Coordinator-General. I read that stuff. I think we are being asked to act as a planning authority, and I don't like that. I don't think it's good governance. I don't think it's wise.

I spoke last week about the need for conscience vote on a stadium. I am not asking for members of parliament to change their position on the Macquarie Point stadium. I am simply requesting that all members have the right to declare their personal opinion. I know there are people both in the Labor and the Liberal Party who do not accept the position of their party at the moment. If they're going into that debate acting as a planning authority, they shouldn't have to be constrained by a predetermined position.

That if we put it down to it, the Premier made with outside his Cabinet when he walked into the AFL, signed a contract. He was getting advice from somebody, and it wasn't the other members of parliament because they didn't know about it.

A conscience vote would help address notable causes of community division and distrust, reinforced by deeply polarising process.

To conclude my speech, the Tasmanian Budget will for the foreseeable future involve a balancing of competing priorities, interests and needs. While I can appreciate the difficult job the government is undertaking, the Budget does not reflect adequate prioritisation of the needs of Tasmania. As an interim budget, this Budget should set the tone for future responsible spending and budgetary management in Tasmania, but instead it continues the status quo, overlooks many issues facing Tasmanians and struggles to deliver any expectation of meaningful progress.

In closing, I want to put on the record that regardless of which way the vote goes in a couple of weeks, I know that all members in this place, once the vote goes one way or the other, will be doing all they can to help heal the division that's happened in our community statewide because of this issue, that has been poorly handled. But this is where we find ourselves and that's politics and we have to deal with it. I know that we will all do our very best, regardless of the decision to make sure that our communities are healing.

[5.54 p.m.]
Mr VINCENT (Prosser - Deputy Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council) - Mr President, having sat there for a few hours now listening intently, I think I should have jumped first and then gone to do some ministerial work, so I didn't quite have to listen to it all.

From the bottom of my heart, I thank everybody for their contributions. It is just marvellous what you pick up from different perceptions. We all have our own bias or thoughts on things, regardless of parties. We are all individuals and to hear everybody's contribution does mean a lot to me. A lot of things I've heard today I would love to have the opportunity to discuss further, to understand or develop or in some cases argue for and against. It would be an interesting conversation to have with many people regarding some of the things and I'm not sure about magnetic waves across the horizon. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=12.1_D=6.6_C=0.75]  I am a practical person that likes to feel and touch things in front of me and get things done, but [Bookmark: Phr3_O=20.9_D=0.5_C=0.83]  I do [Bookmark: Phr4_O=23.9_D=5.9_C=0.79]  like the fact that it was recognised about negative shocks to the economy and the difficulty there.

B [Bookmark: Phr5_O=31.3_D=21.4_C=0.82] efore I get into my ministerial reply, I will add that I was about 6 or 7 years old when my parents started in business. I have been in business for 58 years and from a small family business to large national businesses and at all levels of the spectrum there [Bookmark: Phr6_O=53.8_D=9.0_C=0.74] . To be able to balance short-, medium- and long-term budgeting and to maintain all parts of business, or in this case, a state [Bookmark: Phr7_O=64.5_D=3.8_C=0.77] , is difficult to do. It's very complex [Bookmark: Phr8_O=70.5_D=20.9_C=0.80]  and you must stay focused because of those short-term, medium-term and long-term focuses that we need. I certainly hope after hearing many of the contributions today that we all do stay focused on what needs to happen.

It's been enlightening for me to sit and listen to Mr Abetz, the Treasurer, with a  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=93.8_D=19.0_C=0.84] newfound look at how the economy needs to work and the difficult job that he has and the support that he will need to bring around some of that change. I hope everybody realises and understands my commitment to this state and to my ministry is that my door is always open to have any [Bookmark: Phr10_O=114.5_D=7.9_C=0.81]  sensible discussions. I quite often say five bad ideas grow into a good idea and my door is always open for [Bookmark: Phr11_O=123.3_D=9.0_C=0.90]  consultation on anything that any member here feels that would assist this state. I certainly won't be turning anybody away.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=134.2_D=2.0_C=0.73] With that, I will go into [Bookmark: Phr13_O=137.6_D=4.8_C=0.83]  a more ministerial approach to my Budget reply.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=143.8_D=11.8_C=0.87] The 2025-26 Budget is an interim budget, as we've heard, balancing our strong economic and social achievements with a clear need to respond to the challenges we face. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=156.1_D=10.6_C=0.88]  This government believes in strong finance, strong services and strong families which together deliver a strong future for Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=168.1_D=7.2_C=0.83] In my 13 months as Infrastructure minister, I've grown very fond of wearing the high-vis. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=175.9_D=4.4_C=0.49]  In fact, I like that a damn sight more than having the suit and tie on in this place [Bookmark: Phr18_O=183.5_D=11.8_C=0.88] . It's been nice to get out around construction jobs and see how much that work means to the economy, to people coming through training and it brings back all the memories why I love being in construction. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=197.1_D=9.0_C=0.66]  If you're one of those tens of thousands of Tasmanians who put on the high-vis every day, I can tell you there is no greater supporter of you than me and the Liberal government.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=206.7_D=11.4_C=0.73] The 2025-26 interim Budget demonstrates the Tasmanian government's ongoing commitment to look to the future with optimism and dedicated sense of purpose [Bookmark: Phr21_O=219.0_D=2.5_C=0.76] , building on the success of past budgets. [Bookmark: Phr22_O=223.8_D=6.0_C=0.81]  The interim Budget includes $3.4 billion in infrastructure investment [Bookmark: Phr23_O=230.6_D=1.6_C=0.77]  across the forward Estimates [Bookmark: Phr24_O=232.8_D=4.6_C=0.83]  with a further $1.7 billion planned across government businesses. [Bookmark: Phr25_O=238.6_D=9.4_C=0.88]  The investment includes $1.6 billion over the next four years into building new and improved roads and bridges, along with other transport projects.

 [Bookmark: Phr26_O=249.2_D=10.5_C=0.81] There isn't a corner of the state which isn't going to benefit from our investment over the coming years ensuring Tasmanians can get home sooner and safer. [Bookmark: Phr27_O=262.1_D=8.7_C=0.72]  Here in the south, we are investing $73 million in the Algona Interchange and the Kingston Bypass, and we are kicking off works [Bookmark: Phr28_O=271.4_D=5.4_C=0.78]  to the Arthur Highway corridor as part of a $256 million vision. [Bookmark: Phr29_O=277.9_D=5.6_C=0.73]  We are also moving ahead on works to relieve pressure on the Mornington interchange [Bookmark: Phr30_O=284.1_D=4.4_C=0.84] , beginning with the connecting ramps to the Tasman Highway and Gordons Hill Roa [Bookmark: Phr31_O=289.4_D=5.0_C=0.81] d, which I know will be a welcome upgrade for residents regularly using this route. [Bookmark: Phr32_O=295.4_D=6.4_C=0.82]  This is a project I've been working on beside Clarence City Council for over nine years.

The long-awaited upgrades to the Tasman Bridge are moving along, as is the Southern Outlet as part of our $300 million Greater Hobart Traffic Solution, and planning continues for the new Northern Access Road connecting the Port of Hobart to the Domain Highway. For those Tasmanians travelling the Lyell Highway, our $100 million investment will improve safety and travel times.

Residents in the Derwent Valley and Brighton will witness the close-out of the new Bridgewater Bridge Project, which has truly transformed connectivity for their communities and all Tasmanians since it was opened in June this year. I can't tell you how proud I am every time I travel over the bridge of every single Tasmanian who's contributed to this landmark piece of infrastructure, and there are still several local projects underway to link in with this piece of generational infrastructure.

Close to home for me, the final-stage projects under the South East Traffic Solution and duplication of the Tasman Highway to four lanes past the Tasmania Golf Club, and then duplicating both causeways, will create a consistent four-lane link between Sorell and Hobart. Due to the complex federal environment approvals required for the remaining projects, the Department of State Growth is working towards construction of the section between the Airport Interchange and the Midway Point Causeway in late 2026, with the causeway projects to start in 2027.

When it comes to the north, I can tell you there is no shortage of work up there either for our tradies; not just in roads and bridges, but new infrastructure going up left, right and centre, much of which is being built by the Tasmanian government, significantly boosting the local workforce and economy. The countdown is on to finishing the Midland Highway Action Plan, with works on the final 10-kilometre stretch just north of Campbell Town expected to be released for tender in coming weeks. This follows a very exhaustive environmental approval process with the Commonwealth.

Residents who frequent the West Tamar Highway in the Northern Midlands will benefit from a safer and more effective Illawarra Road connecting the Bass and Midland Highways. On the north-west and west coast, we continue upgrades of the Bass Highway, including west of Wynyard, and improvements between Devonport and Deloraine. Works will continue in stages on the Stanley Highway, as well as improvement to safety on the key west coast connections: the Ridgley and Murchison Highways.

I can stand here and talk about the many projects our government is embarking on. It would take a fair few hours. Instead, I will simply say we remain committed to upgrading and improving our roads and bridges and will continue to back the thousands of workers who keep Tasmania moving forward. After the recent election I was asked to take on the Transport portfolio, and I'm keenly focused on keeping the wheels turning in this space, and I do apologise for the pun.

The 2025-26 interim Budget continues to invest in transport services, ensuring Tasmanians can get to work and back home each day safely, and access essential services no matter where they are and where they live. Our half-price public transport fares have been a real winner with Tasmanians who use our buses and ferries, which is why we've extended the half-price fares until 31 June 2026. While this is primarily a measure to support Tasmanians with cost of living, it also encourages Tasmanians to try out a bus or a ferry on their way to work, school or social events, and I'm pleased to say I've done so myself.

While visiting Metro, I've been amazed at the level of professionalism, brightness of the staff and the positive attitude by all out there. With all the negatives that have been headed Metro's way, it is totally encouraging to see people in their roles out there thoroughly enjoying them. For students and Tasmanians living in regional communities this is particularly beneficial, and we've seen an encouraging uplift in the public transport use out of our regional areas.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=11.3_D=7.1_C=0.84] I know Tasmanians want us to ensure we keep passengers and bus drivers safe. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=19.1_D=4.9_C=0.76]  This is why we're expanding the Transport Officer program [Bookmark: Phr4_O=24.8_D=2.6_C=0.77] , providing greater comfort for those commuting. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=28.2_D=3.7_C=0.91]  Not only are we extending the program to the north [Bookmark: Phr6_O=32.4_D=5.5_C=0.77] , but we are also going to ensure these officers are trained appropriately and equipped with additional powers. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=39.0_D=9.8_C=0.81]  Our work to upgrade bus stops and shelters to become accessible in all types of weather has seen incredible uptake by councils right around the state. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=50.1_D=6.2_C=0.79]  They recently completed a third round, ensuring passengers using these stops and shelters are comfortable.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=61.8_D=9.5_C=0.87] The Budget and forward Estimates also include equity contributions to Metro of $6 million to support fleet replacement [Bookmark: Phr10_O=71.9_D=9.7_C=0.88] ; $1.6 million for CCTV technology for existing metro buses; and $800,000 to undertake capital works at its depots. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=83.1_D=13.0_C=0.69]  For Tasmanians living in the north, they are now benefiting from the new, state-of-the-art Regional Transit Centre which has opened in Launceston, providing convenience and comfort for all travellers [Bookmark: Phr12_O=97.7_D=23.9_C=0.80] . 

Then as one project finishes, as always, another one is on the horizon under our government. The interim Budget continues our key investment into park-and-ride facilities across Greater Hobart, including a new site at Glebe Hill, our in-progress Claremont site and the freshly-completed Midway Point [Bookmark: Phr13_O=122.2_D=2.5_C=0.77] , as well as a number in the state's north. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=125.9_D=11.2_C=0.79]  Our park and rides are helping people living in outer urban areas access public transport and reduce congestion in peak commuter times.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=141.3_D=9.4_C=0.81] Having once fallen on hard times myself and ended up living in a shipping container, I understand the hardships some Tasmanians are experiencing in housing. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=151.8_D=5.5_C=0.82]  This is why I've grabbed the Housing and Planning portfolio with both hands. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=158.1_D=9.0_C=0.77]  I am passionate about seeing more people into homes and reducing the housing register for all those doing it really tough [Bookmark: Phr18_O=169.1_D=9.6_C=0.85] . This is an extremely difficult but emotional portfolio, and I am committed to seeing positive and continual improvements. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=180.0_D=6.3_C=0.75]  This interim Budget reiterates our commitment to supporting the most vulnerable in our community. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=188.0_D=5.8_C=0.91]  This Budget contains $545 million of state money over the forward Estimates [Bookmark: Phr21_O=194.8_D=4.7_C=0.78]  to ensure Tasmanians who need it most have somewhere to call home.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=200.6_D=10.3_C=0.86] Over the next two years, the federal government is contributing an additional $77 million, and we look forward to the conversations to ensure that amount grows. [Bookmark: Phr23_O=213.4_D=9.7_C=0.77]  This annual support to Homes Tasmania covers both operational expenses and borrowing costs associated with meeting capital expenditure requirements [Bookmark: Phr24_O=224.0_D=3.0_C=0.65]  and is a vital part of Homes Tasmania's work. [Bookmark: Phr25_O=229.5_D=4.1_C=0.77]  Using borrowings and Home Tasmania's existing funding [Bookmark: Phr26_O=235.2_D=11.7_C=0.74] , we are investing around $230 million this year alone in building new social and affordable rental housing, MyHome Investments, mod homes and land subdivision works. [Bookmark: Phr27_O=249.2_D=6.7_C=0.89]  This investment is key to us delivering our goal of 10,000 homes by 2032.

 [Bookmark: Phr28_O=257.2_D=4.8_C=0.86] This Budget also acknowledges the importance of crisis supports [Bookmark: Phr29_O=262.6_D=24.4_C=0.85] , ensuring we do what we can to support those in their greatest time of need. We are investing in five new safe-space units at the Hobart Women's Shelter, ensuring they continue to support those who need the shelter and provide them with safer accommodation options, particularly for women and children who have been impacted by family violence.  [Bookmark: Phr30_O=288.9_D=16.0_C=0.80] We are also supporting women 55 years and over experiencing homelessness through our $2.4 million investment in the old Bethlehem House site to secure its ongoing use as temporary accommodation during their transition to new independent living facilities. Provision of these services is vital, giving these women the opportunity and support they need to get back on their feet and transition to living in mainstream accommodation.

We are also investing in the new Bethlehem House facility, which is providing beds for 74 men experiencing homelessness, which also accommodates their best canine friends. On Sunday I had the opportunity to visit Bethlehem House and saw firsthand the fantastic work Vinnies are doing to support those men through the many and varied challenges they face. I congratulate Heather Kent as the outgoing CEO of Vinnies and wish her every success in her new role at Palliative Care Tasmania. A gentleman by the name of Irish, a colourful character who did not mind telling it how it was, shared his story. It made it very clear, if it had not been for the support of Bethlehem House, he would not still be with us today. His story was and still is to me, very raw. His openness in sharing his story is something I will never forget. Seeing and hearing directly from some of these residents about the impact wrap around services like these have is a really moving experience and a reminder of the real human face of this Budget.

Coming from local government, I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to planning and that's all on a good day. I am fully aware of the fact that the planning reforms we implement today will determine the future shape of our state. The Tasmanian Planning Scheme is setting the groundwork for a more comprehensive, consistent planning system to ensure we have the right structure in place to support Tasmania. We need to make sure we are moving ahead with ensuring there is appropriate land supply for new housing and through the Housing Land Supply Act, we have unlocked new land for development. Providing more choice is critical to attracting development, which is why we are implementing a range of incentives which will ultimately result in more housing for Tasmanians who need it. We have also just released for consultation a revised development application panel bill, taking on board the feedback we received earlier in the year. These development assessment panels will provide an alternate independent approval pathway for more contentious and complex development applications. I am fully focused on getting the balance right.

In local government, as a former mayor, I am deeply passionate about the local government sector and ensuring our councils are in the best position to support the wellbeing, sustainability and prosperity of Tasmanians. This Budget delivers on our election promise to increase the heavy vehicle motor charge contribution to local government to $5 million this year. That is a $3.5 million increase on the previous year and comes in response to advocacy from the local government sector. While this is a single year uplift, we are committed to working with the sector to find a sustainable long-term solution.

I thank the Local Government Association of Tasmania for working with us on this increase to support the 14,400 kilometres of Tasmania's roads under their management. We are investing around $90 million over the forward Estimates to continue our support of the pensioner rate remission scheme to provide a concession of 30 per cent off council rates and charges, up to a divine defined maximum annual amount for eligible pensioners. We are also continuing our important work on the future of local government review. We are at a crucial time in delivering our priority reform programme and lifting the bar for the entire sector. I am very pleased to assure members we are powering forward to deliver these vital reforms and I remain aware of the many passionate views of so many in this space and sector.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=9.9_D=10.7_C=0.81] In September, we released a discussion paper on our local councillor numbers and allowances to ensure more effective representation and fairer councillor pay. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=22.1_D=10.3_C=0.84]  In my view, the proposed reforms will help improve local democracy, representation and to better serve our communities.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=33.7_D=6.7_C=0.67] We have also released the Local Government Targeted Amendment Bill 2025 draft for consultation. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=41.5_D=10.5_C=0.83]  The bill builds on feedback and focuses on improving standards of governance, accountability and performance across local government sector. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=53.3_D=10.9_C=0.81]  Soon we will be releasing an exposure draft Electoral Bill which will aim to establish a new and more flexible statutory framework for local government elections. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=65.1_D=7.2_C=0.79]  Collectively, these changes will lead us into the October 2026 local government  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=73.5_D=10.0_C=0.75] elections. I also wish to mention the Local Government Association of Tasmania, who support councils and the government with important policy decisions. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=84.5_D=12.7_C=0.89]  Their expertise is a hugely valuable resource, and I know by partnering with them, as we do on a weekly basis, we achieve the best we can for the sector [Bookmark: Phr10_O=100.0_D=8.1_C=0.77] . Along with sectoral bodies LGAT and Local Government Professionals, we are shaping local government to be professional, efficient [Bookmark: Phr11_O=108.7_D=5.8_C=0.64]  and the space our communities can have continued confidence in.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=116.0_D=9.3_C=0.87] As my understanding grows with my ministries, I am confident I will continue to make a positive difference to this beautiful state. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=125.8_D=2.8_C=0.89]  I am proud to be on this journey with all my colleagues [Bookmark: Phr14_O=129.2_D=0.7_C=0.72] , staff [Bookmark: Phr15_O=130.8_D=2.0_C=0.83] , stakeholders and constituents [Bookmark: Phr16_O=133.6_D=6.3_C=0.82]  that I have in my portfolios as well as the good people of Prosser. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=140.9_D=5.7_C=0.82]  With that, I commend the 2025-2026 interim budget to the House.

[6.17 p.m.]
Mr EDMUNDS (Pembroke) - [Bookmark: Phr18_O=147.3_D=6.2_C=0.70]  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=154.4_D=3.0_C=0.81]  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=166.9_D=6.9_C=0.81]  Mr President, I don't plan to speak for a particularly long time today on the Budget reply and [Bookmark: Phr21_O=174.5_D=10.2_C=0.80]  might echo my thoughts from last year that I kind of feel like sometimes we have the cart before the horse with our evaluation of the budget that isn't informed by the Estimates process.

Ms Forrest interjecting.

Mr EDMUNDS -  [Bookmark: Phr22_O=188.7_D=2.1_C=0.78] Indeed, member for Murchison. [Bookmark: Phr23_O=192.6_D=6.0_C=0.86]  Whilst not necessarily being critical of what we have, maybe that's something we could think about in the future. [Bookmark: Phr24_O=200.2_D=6.7_C=0.83]  A few things I want to put on the record through this process. My notes are a bit scattered.

Ms Rattray - Mine are often like that.

Mr EDMUNDS - Yes [Bookmark: Phr25_O=209.8_D=6.0_C=0.75] , just like the reader of the address. [Bookmark: Phr26_O=218.6_D=19.9_C=0.78]  Alright, let's start with the headline numbers. We have a net operating deficit of $1 billion, 2025-26, net debt of $5 billion in 2024-25, projected to reach $10.4 billion in 2028-29, with borrowing costs increasing to $618 million per annum in 2028-29 [Bookmark: Phr27_O=238.9_D=3.2_C=0.85]  which I will come to in a moment.

 [Bookmark: Phr28_O=244.5_D=5.5_C=0.77] The cost of servicing our debt by the time we get to 2029 [Bookmark: Phr29_O=250.7_D=2.4_C=0.86]  will be three times our housing budget. [Bookmark: Phr30_O=255.5_D=28.6_C=0.77]  It is quite a remarkable piece of information when we talk about trying to get a roof over people's heads.

We have hundreds of millions of dollars of election commitments that are missing from the interim budget, such as the Huon Health Hub, the New Town basketball courts, which I was tuned in for the address from the member for Elwick about, IVF subsidies, the ADHD initiatives, Tasinsure and the Flinders Island airport upgrades, just to name a few. [Bookmark: Phr31_O=284.5_D=9.2_C=0.89]  It was quite ironic or concerning to hear that one of the reasons why there wasn't money for [Bookmark: Phr32_O=294.4_D=10.6_C=0.76]  the commitment for the basketball courts was because there was an election. 

That was an election commitment, so I found that a bit galling, to be honest. It's an absolute rubbish excuse, and in an election that had pork-barrelling at the centre of one of the issues that people were talking about. Certainly, from our party's perspective, we walked the walk on pork-barrelling. Then to hear that the commitment was a hollow one is pretty frustrating and I empathise as the member for Elwick did and others may with that basketball club, because I believe in good faith they probably would have told their members they had a commitment from one side and that might have influenced the decision those people made -

Ms Thomas - And the broader basketball -

Mr EDMUNDS - Indeed, the broader basketball community and then like we saw with the Heart Centre and others is that they're not real commitments. Then they're used to try to browbeat other levels of government into providing the funding that wasn't clarified when those commitments are made.

It is all well and good if you do them at the time. That's fine, whatever, but to misappropriate that money and take all the credit for it whilst essentially funding a shell of what was committed to, frankly, only ends up undermining people's confidence in our democracy.

We have seen the work of certain federal politicians and those overseas that has body blow after body blow on people's confidence in our our democratic systems. I would hate to see that people in our state are going to continue to do that, because we can talk about some of the big things that are in the Budget, but specific commitments for things like ADHD, I know, meant a lot to a lot of people when they were announced during the campaign, and then they're not funded. We will see what those letters that have been sent this week stack up to, whether the letters that were sent are worth the amount of ink used - letters sent to the North West Greyhound Racing Club and salmon workers in this state, or whether they're worth a different type of letter that the Premier has sent out.

How do we get here, Mr President? A lot of others have touched on some of the election commitments made, particularly in 2018 and 2021 and how those early elections are stacked on top of each other and have created a debt situation this government is struggling to manage. Yes, we had COVID-19, but as something I will read into the Hansard later points out, that's about 20 per cent of the problem we are currently dealing with. A lack of fiscal discipline. Spending with no plan to pay for it. Unrealistic forecasting, which is not only up to the size of the problem and wasteful spending, although I will acknowledge that at least this year on the 6 November, Mr Abetz, the Treasurer, did say the sustainability of estates finances is a prerequisite to economic stability. I guess that's some sort of admission about some of those things that have happened.

Ms Forrest - You have to do something about it, though.

Mr EDMUNDS - Indeed.

We have heard some of the excuses: COVID; two state elections; a federal election, a curious one to me - we haven't had a proper early federal election for a while - a lot of fingers being pointed; the commission of inquiry; compensation payments; high inflation; volatile interest rates; global uncertainties; the federal government 'neglect'; rising service delivery costs; a tight labour market; cost-of-living pressures; high wages; and supply chain constraints. I believe that through all of that, after 11 years, I don't really know who could own this problem more than the actual government that created it.

One of the key points that gets pointed out and it's fair enough, but when you get up and point these things out, there's the whole 'what would you do'? Well, there are all the things you could have done until now if you were the alternative government. I will point out some of the things that were put forward and are still being put forward, and indeed, Mr Abetz is welcome to avail himself. Without the resources of Treasury, the opposition was able to put forward $1 billion in savings per post before the last election and had a policy to use windfall revenue to pay down debt, and had the budget repair roundtable, a meaningful roundtable rather than a blame-shifting exercise.

These approaches, along with the the 10-point plan for managing the state's debt, had sign-off from three key groups in Tasmania before the last election - the business lobby, unions and the community sector. That's quite important and it's one of the most disappointing things to me when certainly members of the other place who are on the crossbench start wanting to point fingers around, things like housing and community sector funding, yet, they are the people who chose which government would be sworn in not that long ago.

We have a lot of risks coming forward for this Budget. Even if all the wind's blowing in the right direction, there's going to be challenges for any government. For the sake of the state, I wish them all the best in dealing with that.

I will read a couple of things into the Hansard. I will start with the Treasury of the country's summary of the Tasmanian Budget. Anyone who wants to get into the other six or seven pages of this report I encourage to look them up. (tbc)

The 2025-26 Tasmanian Budget presents a weak economic outlook alongside a soft fiscal outlook. Tasmania forecasts economic growth of 1 per cent in 2025-26, which is the lowest of all states.

Real GSP growth is forecast to pick up to 2.25 per cent in 2026-27 and 2.5 per cent from 27-28.

Tasmania's fiscal outlook has deteriorated further since the 2024-25 Tas MYEFO, with an operating deficit of $1 billion,. 2.3 per cent of GSP for 2025-26 forecasts to improve to a thin surplus of $5.6 million or, 0.01 per cent of GSP in 28-29.

The cumulative operating deficit has worsened by $1.4 billion over the forwards, largely driven by increases in health expenditure.

Net debt is forecast to be $7.1 billion 16 per cent of GSP in 2025-26, rising to $10.4 billion, 20.2 per cent of GSP in 2028-29.

Tasmania is one of four states forecasting net debt to exceed 20 per cent of GSP by the end of the forwards. Standard & Poors and Moody's revised Tasmania's credit rating outlook from stable to negative in their latest reviews. S&P is expected to review Tasmania's credit rating by the end of the year.

We will all have eyes on that.

Tasmania has a 10-year fiscal strategy with 11 long-term 2032-33 targets encompassing a range of fiscal indicators. Tasmania is meeting two of its 11 targets, which is two fewer than the 2024-25 Tas MYEFO. Targets not being met related to credit rating, debt levels, cost of debt, fiscal balance and own source revenue. Tasmania notes that some election commitments may have not been considered in this budget, but will be added to the 2026-27 budget.

In August, Tasmania established Multi-Partisan Budget Consultation Panel as a mechanism for parliamentary input into fiscal settings, with a view to enhancing fiscal sustainability.

That touches on one of my main concerns about this interim Budget - and the black holes around some of the commitments - is that it's a set up for next year to be even worse. I will also read in some analysis, which I appreciated from The Australian, which I believe was published on Election Day. I will quote:

Budget 2025: Promises at the polls leave Tasmania finances in a hole.

I hope this will reinforce some of the points we've already been talking about. The article was by Matthew Denholm [OK].

So, why exactly is Tasmania doubling its already considerable debt?

Eric Abetz, Tasmania's third Liberal Treasurer in 13 months - used his first budget speech to blame everyone else for the tsunami of red ink.

Culprit No.1? Yes, you guessed it: Covid. The virus is still being blamed for wrecking state finances.

Doubtless Rona’s lockdowns and rescue packages took their toll, driving net debt to $1.5 bn by June 30, 2022. But $1.5 n is a long way from $10.4 bn – the level of debt the island state will be sinking in by 2028-29.

Economist Saul Eslake estimates $1.5 bn to $2 bn of debt can be attributed to Covid impacts and responses. So let’s stop blaming the pandemic for more than – at most – 20 per cent of the problem.

Abetz also blamed: compensation for child abuse victims; a federal election; two early state elections; “global uncertainties”; “volatile interest rates”; and “federal government neglect, together with cost-of-living pressures”.

As well, there were “rising service delivery costs”, a “tight labour market”, “higher wages”, “supply chain constraints”, and “the ongoing cost of meeting community expectations for essential services”.

Some of these are of course valid, but don't of themselves explain the repeated recourse to debt rather than a tighter budget management or fiscal reform.

It is difficult to see how a federal election has impacted state coffers in terms of 'meeting community expectations for essential services'. The credit card splurge has not achieved this aim. Public services are worse than ever, with soaring waiting lists for public housing, hospitals at breaking point (parts of the Launceston General don't even have air con, with patients given icy poles to cool down in the summer), while educational attainment levels are poor and the bus network is struggling. 

It was the mention of state elections that Abetz came closest to the truth, and it doesn't relate to the $5 million or so the Tasmanian Electoral Commission requires to make democracy happen. Pushed to explain, the newly-minted Treasurer said, 'State elections, as of necessity, do require from both sides, in fact all sides of politics, new expenditure measures.'

I will just take you back to my comments about pork-barrelling. To go back into the quote, he argued:

The real world in which we live required parties to promise new spending at each election. Think of the consequences had the Liberals gone to the last election, held six months after the last, without making new spending commitments. [TBC]

Essentially to save Premier Jeremy Rockliff's career - well, Treasurer, one consequence would have been to break the cycle of unsustainable Liberal election promises that light at the core of Tasmania's debt problem. Eslake has calculated three-quarters of the increase in net debt since 2017-18, compared to what had been forecast, related to Liberal spending promises at the 2018, 2021 and 2024 state elections. In other words, Liberal pork-barrelling is the main reason Tasmania faces crippling debt, not COVID; not federal elections; not child abuse compensation; et cetera. He concludes: 

Abetz's budget promises a surplus and 'peak debt' to the point at which annual borrowings stop increasing in 2028-29. In the unlikely event these targets are achieved, Tasmanians can, on the evidence and now the Treasurer's own words, expect a return profligacy at the next election - [TBC]

It goes on. It is a pretty disheartening look at how the Tasmanian electoral system, government, Treasury management is running this state.

I will forward that article to Hansard to save them trying to quote in and out. I read that on the day, and I thought I'm definitely using that in my reply. In summary, after 11 years, we've taken Tasmania from having no net debt to the worst set of financials of any state in Australia. The Premier has created a budget crisis, and he's put Eric Abetz in charge of fixing it, and Tasmania knows what that's going to mean: it's going to mean cuts. The Budget is broken, it's full of broken promises and that is breaking the hearts of Tasmanians.

This is just the interim Budget that sets the scene for the cuts that will come. Next year's budget will be the budget where Tasmanians really feel the pain, and there will be no more excuse-making of letters that can refer us forwards to next May. Ultimately, it's Tasmanians who are going to pay the price for these last 11 years, and if you can't manage the budget properly, you can't deliver the services Tasmanians rely on. I will conclude: we now have a Treasurer who called massive debt intergenerational theft. Well, I believe he's been caught red-handed.

[6.34 p.m.]
Mr DUIGAN (Windermere - Minister for Energy and Renewables) - Mr President, I rise to speak today on the 2025-26 Budget and thank other members for their thoughts.

The Budget is, of course, a document that builds on the success of the past decade. As the Treasurer has indicated, it demonstrates that we are, as a government, confident and Tasmania's future remains bright. We are continuing to invest in our community delivering record spending in health, mental health services, targeted housing initiatives and growing our economy. 

I acknowledge that while this is an interim budget, it does get on with the job of delivering for Tasmania. It is laying the foundation to futureproof our state. We have increased our spending in Health by 12 per cent to $14.5 billion. In Education, we're investing some $9.9 billion, while public order and safety have also increased to $3.9 billion over the next four years. We are continuing the important job of building Tasmania's future with $3.4 billion over the next four years in infrastructure, roads, bridges, schools and hospitals, to name but a few.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.7_D=3.4_C=0.84] This Budget supports our communities with hundreds of millions in concession [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.5_D=17.0_C=0.84]  funding to support Tasmanians with the cost of living and extended half-price bus fares. We're tripling our first Home Owner Grant to $30,000 and stamping out stamp duty for first home buyers of existing homes up to $750,000.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=50.4_D=28.4_C=0.85] Across my electorate of Windermere and my portfolios of Energy and Renewables, Parks and Sport, I'm proud of the significant investment we've committed to delivering what matters to Tasmanians: upgrading our schools, roads, community and sporting facilities; improving health and public transport services; creating clean, reliable and affordable energy for our future in creating new industries and opportunities for our economy to grow [Bookmark: Phr5_O=79.5_D=20.0_C=0.81] ; supporting healthy, connected and creative communities through participation and engagement in sports and events, locally, nationally and on wider global stage; and investing in our parks and reserves so that both Tasmanians and visitors can enjoy what makes this part of the world so very special. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=101.2_D=21.4_C=0.83]  

In my wonderful northern electorate of Windermere, I am pleased that the 2025-26 Budget includes infrastructure investments in the things that matter to those communities. As part of the school-building blitz, we're upgrading primary schools at Mowbray Heights and South George Town, and I have been very pleased to visit both of those [Bookmark: Phr7_O=124.3_D=7.6_C=0.77]  schools and hear their excitement. 

We're continuing to invest in the East Tamar Highway, progressing work toward a second Tamar River bridge and [Bookmark: Phr8_O=132.3_D=28.2_C=0.79]  improved safety on the Bridport Road. We're also investing in health services in Launceston which will benefit the whole region, including the redevelopment of the Launceston General Hospital, delivering the new Northern Heart Centre and developing a new Northern Mental Health precinct. 

Keeping communities healthy also means supporting them to be fit and active and participating in local sports, and it's also great for our mental health [Bookmark: Phr9_O=161.3_D=1.2_C=0.78] , keeping us connected [Bookmark: Phr10_O=162.8_D=14.3_C=0.77]  and it's great for kids in our communities. That's why I'm so very pleased that this Budget continues to invest in our sporting clubs and facilities, in particular to deliver the Northern Suburbs Recreational Hub, which is [Bookmark: Phr11_O=177.3_D=14.5_C=0.77] , excitingly, getting very close to completion. 

This impressive facility will provide, in stage 1, seven additional indoor courts across netball, basketball and multi-use, as well as a range of other community spaces [Bookmark: Phr12_O=192.3_D=5.2_C=0.85] , and I know the community is eagerly anticipating the day when the doors will open. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=198.4_D=29.7_C=0.82]  In other positive news for the region, we've now committed to build a further four courts on the site, providing an even better outcome for local sporting clubs. This Budget also reinforces the government's commitment to much-needed upgrades at the Elphin Sports Centre, and I look forward to these progressing to ensure this much-loved, well-used facility continues to serve the northern community. 

The Budget ensures we continue to support our economy and industries to grow. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=228.9_D=29.0_C=0.82]  A key example of this, in my electorate and in my Energy portfolio: there are a number of continuing initiatives in Bell Bay to support opportunities for new industry such as the Tasmanian Green Hydrogen Hub and the $5 million Renewable Energy Services Hub. Bell Bay is the perfect location for the hub with its deepwater port, established port infrastructure and highly-experienced and skilled workforce. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=258.7_D=13.0_C=0.78]  Our initiatives, together with TasPort's proposed Bass Strait Renewable Energy Terminal, seek to take advantage of this, working with industry to attract investment and leverage our natural assets.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=273.8_D=23.5_C=0.81] In the field of energy, we are investing $64.8 million over the forward Estimates to progress Tasmania's renewable energy agenda and secure our future as a clean-energy powerhouse. Following the positive final investment decision for Project Marinus announced on 1 August, our focus is on ensuring Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr17_O=298.2_D=3.4_C=0.87]  is well positioned and ready to seize the benefits. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=301.9_D=3.0_C=0.82]  We are focused on delivering Project Marinus, as are our government businesses. Project Marinus, as has been reported, is forecast to deliver on average $470 million annually to Tasmania's bottom line. This goes to support growth in our economy and enhance our energy security. As part of the negotiations ahead of our final investment decision we will now be providing no further equity funding for the construction of the Marinus Link. Prior funding of $103 million is currently recognised as equity shareholding of 17.7 per cent in Marinus Link. We get the the benefits of Project Marinus Link and a seat at the table.

It remains very important that Tasmanians continue to have a voice in those important issues and that we no longer have to provide further equity to Marinus Link. In fact, our decision to cap our contribution to Marinus Link construction costs has already saved the Budget a total of of $98.5 million, based on current cost estimates. When taking into account all funding sources, Tasmania is expected to contribute less than 5 per cent of the cost to construct Marinus Link.

The Budget does include a $191 million equity contribution to deliver the North West Transmission Developments, essential infrastructure and part of Project Marinus and our renewable energy agenda. The bulk of the cost of that piece of the project is currently estimated at 84 per cent of the total build-out cost and will be funded by concessional finance from the Clean Energy Financing Corporation, importantly with the benefits of that concessional funding being passed on to consumers.

I also point to the fact we have negotiated with the federal government a further $346 million grant to be applied to the TasNetworks regulatory asset base to again lower the cost of that build-out to customers in Tasmania.

Our government's significant investment in renewables will create more jobs and ensure Tasmanians continue to have the lowest power prices in the nation. Renewable energy generation is critical to our state's economy. Our energy system has always been a strong driver of economic growth within the state and now our strong renewable credentials will help set Tasmania up for a strong and prosperous future. We want to enable more energy generation coming online sooner and that is why we are delivering new and streamlined approvals and case management processes through the Renewable Energy Approval Pathway.

Across four years from 2024-25, we've committed $14.4 million in funding into ensuring new energy proponents have the support they need to navigate the necessary approvals processes. This will not only unlock millions of dollars of investment but also goes a long way to supporting our ambitious target to double our renewable energy generation by 2040. We are committed to ensuring Tasmania is one of the easiest places to invest for renewable energy proponents, so long as the environmental standards we expect are met. Tasmania's reputation as a renewable energy powerhouse means we are ideally positioned to take advantage of opportunities to create jobs and future industries. 

This includes the development of new industries like green hydrogen and clean fuels. Our vision to be a global leader in green hydrogen production is detailed in our Tasmanian Renewable Hydrogen Action Plan. The 2025-26 Budget continues delivering on the development of the Tasmanian Green Hydrogen Hub, which we are doing with $70 million of funding support from the Australian Government. Once fully realised, the hub is expected to create over 700 direct and indirect jobs and will drive economic growth across the state. In the future the hub will be a precinct of industry and business, all engaged in producing and using hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives.

We are a 100 per cent net renewable jurisdiction, an impressive achievement, on not just a national stage but also at an international level. This is a huge draw card for our state and for new industries and businesses, helping to drive that economic growth we seek.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=14.4_D=29.1_C=0.82] Tasmania has always been a pioneer in hydropower development and continued investment in our existing system will be key to providing low cost, reliable and clean energy. We can't forget the significant planned private sector investment in wind and solar generation projects, which are critical to supporting our renewable energy agenda. The 2025-26 Budget ensures economic growth alongside sensible debt management [Bookmark: Phr3_O=43.6_D=7.3_C=0.86]  and continues to provide that business friendly investment environment that we have seen and reported on today [Bookmark: Phr4_O=52.5_D=20.7_C=0.78]  by cutting red tape and no new or increased taxes.

In the world of sport, we know how important this is and being active plays a pivotal role in improving both our physical and mental health, and are equally critical to building community connection and social purpose. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=73.8_D=20.7_C=0.84]  The Tasmanian government is committed to ensuring more Tasmanians, regardless of their age or background, have the opportunity to be active and have somewhere to play the sports they love. It is so encouraging that we are seeing growth among just about every sport that you care to name, whether it's basketball, pickleball, [Bookmark: Phr6_O=95.3_D=27.4_C=0.79]  Tai Chi or Pilates, Tasmanians are getting out and we are pleased with that and we continue to work with our sporting organisations to provide safe, inclusive and fun opportunities to participate in sporting, sport and active recreation.

This focus includes working to increase the participation and involvement of women and girls in all aspects of sport and active recreation [Bookmark: Phr7_O=123.5_D=1.5_C=0.63] , as participants, but also [Bookmark: Phr8_O=125.5_D=12.1_C=0.79]  as coaches and leaders, officials, volunteers and administrators. To achieve this, we are developing a Women and Girls in Sports strategy, enabling greater access and participation of women and girls in sport and active recreation. The development and implementation of the strategy is being backed through investment in the Budget. I look forward to being able to release the final strategy in coming months. 

The Budget delivers on our commitment to support more Tasmanians to participate in activities through the continuation of the $100 Ticket to Play and the second round of the highly successful pilot Ticket to Wellbeing program for eligible [Bookmark: Phr10_O=168.9_D=14.3_C=0.73]  older Tasmanians. I acknowledge the very rapid take up of that program which was open and closed relatively -

Ms Forrest - That is, the rapid uptake of old age in this state.

Mr DUIGAN - Well, that's true enough too, but it's great to see [Bookmark: Phr11_O=185.1_D=10.8_C=0.81]  the enthusiasm which some of our older Tasmanians have seen that opportunity and look forward to seeing that grow. I note the Budget includes [Bookmark: Phr12_O=197.7_D=1.3_C=0.43]  a growth in funding to support [Bookmark: Phr13_O=200.0_D=26.0_C=0.77]  the Ticket to Wellbeing program which enables older Tasmanians to get involved or stay connected.

Our sporting clubs are often the lifeblood of our communities, a place to gather as well as a place to participate. To support our clubs, to provide suitable facilities. the government continues to fund the Tasmanian Infrastructure Grant Program with $5 million available to provide grants to the sport and active recreation sector [Bookmark: Phr14_O=226.9_D=4.7_C=0.66]  and that's to build new or upgrade existing sport and active recreation infrastructure.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=233.3_D=28.6_C=0.84] Our commitment to our very own Tasmanian AFL and AFLW teams continues and is unwavering. We know this opportunity will be transformational for our state for generations to come and we are delivering on that commitment to set up the club for success, to strongly represent this proud foundation football state. In addition to our committed funding for the AFL High Performance Centre, the 2026 Budget [Bookmark: Phr16_O=262.1_D=24.6_C=0.80]  provides a significant investment of $25 million to support the infrastructure and relocation needs of community clubs affected by the development of the AFL High Performance Centre. I take this opportunity to pass my thanks on to both of those clubs for their ongoing support and understanding as we work through this process. They have been great [Bookmark: Phr17_O=287.8_D=4.7_C=0.87]  partners in this.

The new community sporting infrastructure will be a key driver [Bookmark: Phr18_O=292.9_D=7.9_C=0.81]  and enabler of not just economic benefit, but positive social and health outcomes for the Kingborough community and more broadly.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=302.6_D=2.2_C=0.69] This government is also investing $130 million into community sporting clubs and infrastructure right across the state, and I believe you would have to extend your mind back some period of time to find a similar period in time where so much money has been allocated for community sports infrastructure. This includes upgrades to Dial Park which has been mentioned, the new Northern Suburbs Community Recreation Hub, Elphin Sports Centre, Glenorchy Sports Centre, increased capacity at the Devonport Oval Sports Complex precinct, and improved and additional facilities for community venues such as Penguin Sports and Services Club and the Valley Road Regional Football Club, among many others. On top of this, the $130 million major redevelopment underway to transform UTAS Stadium, and our $12 million investment to improve the Silverdome.

The Tasmanian Institute of Sport continues to successfully support talented Tasmanian athletes to develop their sporting potential and compete successfully at national and international level, including, the Olympic and Paralympic and Commonwealth Games. That's why we are investing $1.5 million for the Talent ID for 2032 program. This program was created to uncover local sporting talent with the aim of developing athletes for the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games. Access to organised sports opportunities shouldn't depend on where you live. Programs such as Reclink are doing fantastic work in our communities, particularly in Southern Tasmania, providing access to sporting competitions for young people who might not otherwise have that opportunity to participate. I'm pleased that this year's Budget includes an additional $450,000 over the forward Estimates to enable the Reclink team to strengthen and continue this important work.

Of course, our government, and as minister, we are very proud of our world-class national parks, reserves and Crown lands. Tasmanians are fortunate that wherever we live, we can enjoy the benefits of these natural areas. They also draw people from all over the world to experience their wonder, showcasing our unique flora, fauna and landscapes. National parks and reserves are an important contributor to our Tasmanian economy, and that's particularly true in our regions. 

We know that the Overland Track and Three Capes Track, for example, continue to be major drawcards and that's why we are investing $40 million to deliver the next iconic walk in the Tyndall Range. The delivery of this new multi-day walk will drive economic and social benefits for the West Coast, and I know there's a great deal of excitement there in Tasmania more broadly. The new walk will add to our suite of world-class walking experiences that attract visitors to Tasmania, encouraging them to stay longer and spend more. We know that, for example, 92 per cent I believe it is, of people who have completed the Overland Track or the Three Capes Walk say they would be interested in coming back to Tasmania to complete a similar walk, so we look forward to getting on with our next iconic walk.

This Budget demonstrates our government's focus on ensuring the Parks and Wildlife Service is on a sustainable footing, and I believe that's really important. I'm very pleased with that outcome, as minister, with an additional $21.6 million over the forward Estimates in operational funding, in recognition that wages, insurance, fuel and contractor costs have all increased, and the size and scale of the task in front of Parks has not decreased. We've also shown our ongoing commitment to Parks with a $12 million investment over the forward Estimates to ensure our parks and reserves continue to be upgraded, accessible and safe.

In addition to this, we continue to invest in capital upgrades and projects right across the state. This has included delivering upgrades to the boardwalk and bridge at Goblin Forest, ensuring it is accessible for Tasmanians living with disability. That continues to be a focus for Parks. As you can probably anticipate, providing access into some of our more remote areas is a challenge and comes at a cost. The Goblin Forest Walk is a 400-metre circuit and one of Tasmania's 60 great short walks. It's fantastic that it has now reopened for visitors to enjoy.

We've invested $1.6 million as part of upgrades in the Dial Range Reserves. The new Mount Montgomery to Mount Dial walking track was recently completed, providing a unique visitor experience in showcasing the panoramic views of the area. The new loop walking track includes 2 kilometres of new tracks with a 15 metre aluminium bridge.

I am also excited that progress continues on all access boardwalk along Mcbrides Creek in the Ferndene State Reserve, another component of the Dial Range Reserve upgrades, with all of those upgrades expected to be completed by 2028.

For those further up the north-west coast, the rugged beauty of the Nut at Stanley draws about 50,000 people each year. The government has committed $2.3 million over 4 years to improve safety and accessibility at the Stanley landmark. The recent completion of a walking track upgrade at the Nut has improved visitor access and removed the opportunity for people to interact with cars, which is long been an issue. As a result of the work, visitors can now walk along a track that connects Godfrey's Beach to the Nut. In addition, an all-access track featuring handrails, widened paths, and a more gradual slope has been built from the Nut Cafe to the base of the Zig Zag Track, which is another way we are working to enhance the experience in our parks and reserves.

Our parks and reserves are susceptible to fire. Fighting bushfire is a combined effort from all our state's fire agencies. This includes the fantastic team at the Parks and Wildlife Service who I feel sometimes go somewhat unheralded. That's why we're backing our ability to manage fire events through a $678,000 investment in the bushfire winch insertion capability. This enables winch capacity for the 2025-26 fire season. This capacity is crucial to support that early and rapid response to bushfires, particularly in remote areas. We know that getting to them quickly and extinguishing them before they become big fires is the only real method to control fires in those remote areas.

We are continuing to invest in sustainable platforms to ensure Tasmanian visitors to Tasmania contribute to those services that they use and that includes the rollout of pay and display machines making it easier for people to purchase parks passes. They've been a great success. We continue to deliver other initiatives including $2 million funding for our Statewide Parks Online Booking System, which will make it easier to plan and book a getaway. We will hopefully have an impact on things like ghost camping and other issues that exist.

I am also very pleased that the budget continues to support the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens with over $500,000 additional funding for infrastructure upgrades to the Conservatory and historic Early Wilmot Wall, which is in addition to the $7.6 million project that is delivering enhanced visitor amenities, including accessibility improvements.

In conclusion, this budget is about keeping Tasmania strong: strong finances, strong communities, and strong services. Our government believes in taking a balanced approach to managing the state's finances while we continue to invest in infrastructure and capital works in every corner of our state delivering the services that matter to Tasmanian such as health, housing, and education.

I commend the Treasurer on the work that he has done, noting it has been a very compressed timeframe to have this, as it has been noted, interim Budget out on time. I look forward to delivering the outcomes of the Budget for the people of Tasmania and the people of Windermere.

Mr President, I commend the budget to the House.
