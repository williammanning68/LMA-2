QUESTIONS

Teacher Safety in Classrooms

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[10.02 a.m.]
Your own department's annual report reveals the cost of escalating classroom violence. More than 100 Tasmanian teachers were injured so severely they couldn't return to work, and workers' compensation claims for psychological harm are up 60 per cent in two years. One in four new teachers resign in their first five years of service. Teachers are being assaulted, stressed beyond breaking point and resigning in record numbers, yet you continue to downplay the crisis. Will you finally take responsibility for unsafe conditions in our schools, and what exactly are you doing to keep teachers, support staff and students safe in the classroom?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. The impact that some of the bullying and discrimination we see in our school environments is deeply concerning. So much of the brunt of that falls onto the shoulders of our teachers and it is deeply concerning. It's one of the reasons I was so disappointed when we went to an election and it stopped the work of the committee that was looking at bullying and discrimination in schools. I think that is going to be a great body of work that we will be able to look at as a government to see what some of the recommendations and findings are that come out of that.

I know this is a big issue and that is why we have invested into wellbeing supports, looking at how we better support our principals and teachers. You mentioned early year teachers, and we are certainly investing into making sure we have wellbeing touchpoints with them within the first six months of beginning work in the education system, then having a follow-up touch-point with them.

We are absolutely committed to ensuring we are there for our teachers and that we are putting in place the supports that they need, because we need them to be absolutely thriving in their workplaces so that our children can thrive.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Mr WILLIE - Does the minister accept that under her leadership classrooms have become less safe?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Minister for Education.

Ms PALMER - We know that when children walk through the front gates of a school they don't leave behind the issues that they face everyday. We know whatever has happened in their home the night before, the morning of, or on the way to school, all those issues come with them into a classroom. We know that we have children who react. It's a reaction to trauma, which is why we have invested in our schools to ensure there is support for children who are experiencing trauma, because we know that for probably the majority of incidents where we do see violence, it comes from a place of trauma, little people and older kids trying to navigate life. We're putting supports in place to ensure that we can help children who are experiencing trauma and wraparound services for our teachers and our education staff.


Confidence in Education Minister

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[10.06 a.m.]
Teachers and support staff have lost confidence in your leadership, citing your failure to keep schools safe and deal with violence in classrooms. You said that it's not your job to negotiate in good faith on wages and conditions and didn't know your own department had cancelled meetings. Your workforce, parents and community don't have faith in you and it's unclear who does. Who's backing you as Education minister?

ANSWER

You know you've twisted a lot of things to conflate that -

Mr Willie - They moved no confidence in you.

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable minister is the only one who has the call right now. I ask that the honourable minister be heard in silence.

Ms PALMER - Thank you, Speaker. I know that they have to twist things and I know that's your job -

Mr Willie - We're not twisting anything. They moved no confidence in you.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Ms PALMER - and that's okay.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. I remind all honourable members in this place that when they ask a question, they need to allow the minister or the Premier to answer the question without interjection. If the member is not satisfied with the answer that the minister provides, they can ask a supplementary or another question. I know that the opposition still has five more questions they can ask, but you're making it impossible for me to listen to the minister's answer to determine if a supplementary is in order or not, as well as making it very hard for Hansard to record. This morning I will not hesitate in giving warnings to people. I ask that the minister be heard in silence, please.

Ms PALMER - Thank you very much, honourable Speaker. Where I am totally focused is in our schools. That's why I have visited over 120 of our schools, making sure I spend one-on-one time with our principals when I go there to get a really good understanding of all the different and unique challenges we have in all of our different schools. I also spend time in classrooms and time talking to school staff as well as our amazing educators. That is where I get all the information I need that absolutely drives me to try to make the changes that I can in our schools.

This is a difficult time going through the industrial negotiations. They have to take place where they have to take place, but for me, I'm totally focused on what is happening in our schools, talking to our teachers and our principals and talking to our families as well about what they want for their children, what they want for their school environments.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Who is actually backing the Education minister, because it's certainly not the workforce.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Your comments are on the record.

Members interjecting.

 [Bookmark: _Hlk213839036] The SPEAKER - Order. That was a comment. The question was, 'Who is supporting the Minister for Education?' So that was more a corporate question. I'm ruling that it was more a comment, it was not a direct question to the minister.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The only person who has the call is the Leader of the Greens.


Huon Salmon Farms - Dolphin Deaths

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.09 a.m.]
In the last six months, a baby dolphin was found dead with its head trapped in a Huon salmon net. This is the harrowing reality of the salmon farming industry. Their nets entangle, maim and drown dolphins. Despite a maximum four-hour reporting period, Huon waited until the next day to report that baby dolphin, and they froze the dolphin so a necropsy couldn't be done. Another dolphin died after being caught in a hole in one of Huon's nets. Divers were not called to retrieve the body until the next day, by then it had washed away. Two more dolphins died on consecutive days, these dolphins were also frozen. Only one dolphin was able to undergo necropsy and it showed the cause of death as fractured teeth, erosion of the head and drowning from net tangling. If this is an industry, as you say, on notice, what will you do to stop further cruel dolphin deaths and to make sure salmon farming companies comply with requirements?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for her question. I am advised that the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRE) regulates wildlife interactions and the use of seal management options in the marine farming industry more broadly. The management of wildlife interactions with aquaculture activities, like land-based farming, is complex, as I am sure you appreciate, and it is an ongoing challenge for marine operators.

I am aware of the reports, as you have stated. Under the seal management framework, data is reported to the NRE Tasmanian Wildlife Health and Marine section monthly, and is collated, reviewed and published on the department's website every six months. I am advised that aquaculture companies are encouraged to report wildlife deaths promptly to enable the department to collect suitable carcasses for post-mortem investigations, which can help confirm the cause of death and monitor for disease. The example you raised is indeed distressing and regrettable. I want to reinforce that.

NRE Tas scientists are working with aquaculture companies to better understand circumstances around these most recent interactions to inform further continuous improvement, which is what I have been talking about for some time - the last decade, in fact - when it comes to the aquacultural industry, which this government values. We value the industry, we value the regional jobs creation it brings, and we will continue to support the industry, albeit learnings, such as the example you raised, need for continuous improvement. We do have a study into the industry which from which we will take more learnings about the industry and its need for sustainability.

I am aware that the past year, NRE Tas has received reports of dolphin mortalities associated with entanglement in fish-farm netting on Huon Aquaculture leases. Aquaculture companies are required, as I say, to report wildlife deaths quickly to enable the department to collect suitable carcasses for post-mortem investigations.

There is no suggestion, I am informed that the deaths that were related to any breach of requirements under the company's lease and committing arrangements. Huon has informed NRE Tas of scheduled changes to infrastructure that may help to reduce the risk of dolphin entanglement, and NRE will follow the progress of these works and evaluate the effects of these changes.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - The Premier mentioned a number of things that are being done, but none of them will change the situation. The reason that Huon Aquaculture and other companies keep illegally freezing animals and not reporting them as required is because they are not feeling the pain of penalties. Will you bring in serious penalties that cause them to feel the pain of the harm that they are causing marine wildlife?

The SPEAKER - Sorry, that was related to your answer. Premier, do have you anything further to add to your lines because -

Dr Woodruff - It was related to the question about the changes you're making to stop it happening again.

Mr ROCKLIFF - There have been significant changes over the last decade with respect to wildlife management. I have been talking about dolphins and that's regrettable, very regrettable, as I have already said; but the development of infrastructure to mitigate seal interactions has seen the number of seal interactions significantly has seen the number of seal interactions significantly decline, with reductions in seal attacks on workers, reductions in damage to nets, and resultant entanglement. Indeed, since 2020, I am advised there has been a 78 per cent decline in reported seal mortalities. That is an example of the continuous improvement that we need to ensure when it comes to other wildlife -

Dr Woodruff - Just increase the penalties.

The SPEAKER - Order, Dr Woodruff. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - When it comes to other wildlife interactions, we need to see, again, some significant improvement.


Salmon Industry - Florfenicol Warnings

Mr GEORGE question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mrs ARCHER

[10.15 a.m.]
I welcome the Minister for Health back to the Chamber. You will be aware that the Huon Valley Council has called boat ramps and waterfront access points to carry warning signs of diseased salmon pens being treated with antibiotics. Neither the EPA nor the health department, nor in fact Tassal, carry clear and prominent warnings to stay away from infected leases and pens. You are responsible for our community's health and wellbeing. What measures are being taken to alert recreational and professional fishers, tourists, and visiting sailors about which pens to stay away from? Assuming the minister is not able to prohibit wild fish from swimming beyond the three-kilometre zone, surely that should be expanded to seven kilometres - a distance at which wild fish have been found to have unsafe levels of antibiotics?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, none of us want to see a repeat of last summer's devastating salmon mortality events. Not the government, not the industry, and certainly not the community. As was mentioned earlier, last week the Tasmanian government was advised that the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority has approved an emergency use permit for florfenicol in Tasmanian salmon farms. Under the permit, which specifies dosage rates and administration methods, florfenicol may only be used when veterinarians determine treatment is necessary and its use must be strictly monitored and regulated under all relevant legislation. The government has ensured that comprehensive information on fish health and florfenicol use, regulation and monitoring is available to the public on relevant department websites including NRE Tas, the Environment Protection Authority (EPA), and Public Health.

In regard to the potential risks, for example, for recreational fishers, I note that the advice provided by the Director of Public Health is on the Health website and says that: 

Florfenicol is an antibiotic used in many countries for veterinary medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture, including at salmon farms. When farmed salmon are treated with florfenicol in medicated feed, wild fish nearby may also eat some of this feed. There are no reports of adverse human health effects from exposures to traces of florfenicol in meat or fish. However, recreational fishers may choose to avoid exposure to antibiotic residues, the traces of florfenicol in the fish that they catch and eat.

There are no Public Health restrictions on recreational fishing within three kilometres of a treated lease; and the truth is that this is precautionary advice from the Director of Public Health.

Supplementary Question

Mr GEORGE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr GEORGE - The minister has not answered my question. The core of the question is what action is being taken to make prominent warning signs on waterfronts and boat ramps and on websites that there are diseased salmon pens being treated with antibiotics and that the people who are fishing for wild fish should stay away?

The SPEAKER - Honourable minister. 

Mrs ARCHER - Honourable Speaker, I reiterate that the advice provided is precautionary and that recreational fishers may choose, if they want to, to fish within that zone. It is precautionary advice -

Mr George - What warning signs have been put?

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr George - Just answer the question.

Mrs ARCHER - There's no requirement for warning signs because it is precautionary advice from the Director of Public Health.

Mr George - Honourable Speaker.

The SPEAKER - In regard to the honourable member, just stand and say, 'point of order, relevance 45' if you want to bring the minister back. Thank you.




Mr O'BYRNE question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT 

[10.20 a.m.]
Among the long list of problems you've inherited in your new portfolios is a common ticketing system for public transport. When first promised in 2018, common ticketing was predicted to be operating by 2019-20 at a cost of $7 million. It was announced again at $7.5 million in 2019 and promised again before the 2021 election as a $31.5 million spend. After Metro Tasmania has struggled to progress common ticketing, the project was transferred to the Department of State Growth. The most recent public estimate for this project was made during GBE hearings last year, when your predecessor, minister Abetz, said the project would cost $35 million. However, the Department of State Growth annual report released last week shows the government has awarded a $65 million tender to Cubic Transportation for common ticketing under a direct sourcing process. What is going on here? Has the cost of common ticketing seriously increased to $65 million?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. Common ticketing is something we have been committed to for some time and, to say the least, it is proving quite difficult to bring out of Queensland at the moment. I would have to confirm some of the pricing around it because nothing that has come across my desk as yet has confirmed a set price on the system. We have been corresponding substantially with Cubic in Queensland, backwards and forwards, because of the difficulty of them introducing throughout Queensland the full suite of what we wish to do in Tasmania.

We have just set up the ferries so that they can have a trial program with the ticketing to make sure it is working fine and can flow on through. The correspondence we have been relating to is some of the timing delays, and one of the advantages, I guess, in the delays is around the fact that we are learning from another state's mistakes, but the delays are totally regrettable and are something we are still working through. 

There is a lot more work to do; a lot more understanding of some of the issues and how it flows on to different forms of transport. I'm happy to come back to the member regarding the pricing situation. I've been dealing largely with just the time delays and what that might mean to Tasmania or how it may interact with ferries and other contractors working under the common ticketing system. 

Mr O'Byrne - I'm just confirming that the minister will take that on notice?

The SPEAKER - Is that supplementary question? 

Mr O'Byrne - I just want to confirm that he is going to come back to the House to report. 

The SPEAKER - I do encourage members to say 'supplementary' so that it doesn't count as another question. Honourable minister, are you taking it on notice?

Mr VINCENT - Yes. I could not guarantee a timeline on that. I'll just need to do a bit more work on that and come back to the House. 


Salmon Industry - Florfenicol Warnings

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Mr PEARCE

[10.23.a.m.]
The news that multinational salmon corporations have been green-lighted to use florfenicol in public waters has outraged coastal communities and recreational fishers. The Director of Public Health's warning is that if recreational fishers want to avoid exposure to antibiotic residues in wild fish, they shouldn't fish within three kilometres of a lease site for at least three weeks after antibiotic treatments have occurred. As the minister for Health just pointed out, that is precautionary advice and people can't make a choice if they don't know. There's no information for recreational fishers to know when antibiotics are being dumped into the waters, where and how much, and when it's safe to fish again. Will you adopt the sensible call of the Huon Valley Council Mayor, who's listened to recreational fishers, and make sure every boat ramp has that information posted with QR codes that link to real-time disclosure of the date and quantity of antibiotic treatments and the coordinates of affected areas?

The SPEAKER - The member's time has expired.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for her question. I think it's already been stated this morning fairly clearly, concisely and very scientifically based. The national body, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, has given conditional permits for the release and use of florfenicol in Tasmanian waters. Along with that was the scientific analysis done of the potential risks of using that particular medication and that has been promulgated and inculcated down through the chain of command to the Tasmanian government.

The Chief Medical Officer, as the good minister has already detailed in some clarity, is quite clear in what she's saying with that warning. It is cautionary advice from the Chief Medical Officer only. It does not warrant or cut over into a warning. It is cautionary advice and therefore does not require, as the good minister has already stated, any further form of identification of any risk that isn't there.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.
Dr WOODRUFF - People can't choose if they don't know. This area is the minister's responsibility. Salmon are withheld from public consumption to protect people from antibiotic residues for a period of time. Recreational fishers who catch wild fish should be able to make a choice about whether they eat fish contaminated with antibiotic residues. Will you make the information available, as the Huon Valley Council Mayor has said, to people in her community and other communities on boat ramps through QR codes so that people can make a choice?

The SPEAKER - The member's time has expired.

Mr PEARCE - I understand your concern.

Dr Woodruff - It's not my concern, it's the community's concern.

The SPEAKER - Order, Dr Woodruff, the only one who's talking right now is the honourable minister.

Mr PEARCE - I understand the concerns you're conveying here in this place. However, it is the scientific advice from the APVMA, as it is the Chief Medical Officer, that this is cautionary advice and that has been promulgated on the NRE site, the EPA site -

Dr Woodruff - Yes, but how do people know?

The SPEAKER - Order. Thank you. Honourable minister, please resume.

Mr PEARCE - These sites clearly have that information. Industry and recreational fishing bodies have all been availed that information. We've been as clear and transparent as we possibly can in availing them of that and disseminating that information.


TT-Line - Insolvency

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.27 a.m.]
Yesterday, you said that you would inform the House whether you or the government received any legal advice on whether TT-Line had been trading while insolvent. You didn't come back to the House yesterday. Have you got that advice and, if so, will you table it?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. First, I will restate that it's been a challenging journey when it comes to the new vessels and associated infrastructure and there was a need for us as a government to intervene. We took action. We've got a new board, we've got a new CEO, a new Chair and new management. I can inform the House that in October last year I requested a thorough analysis of the current state of the company's finances. Treasury and TASCORP did this work. We took action. We've raised the borrowing cap, we've guaranteed the debt through TASCORP and now we've injected equity into this Budget.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - The question was about legal advice. If he doesn't have legal advice, why not?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - My understanding is that the company got legal advice for the directors.




Mr GARLAND question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.29 a.m.]
A number of landowners issued a statement a couple of weeks ago saying they will refuse to sign agreements for new transmission across their properties as part of the North West Transmission Developments proposal. The ABC reported this number was as high as 60. How many landowners in the path of the North West Transmission Developments are yet to sign up to TasNetworks acquiring an easement over their property? Will you respect their wishes?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. In terms of the North West Transmission Developments, I would point the member to TasNetworks for the actual status of how many land owners remain yet to sign up. Obviously, we have, as a government, detailed our level of compensation, and that is quite extensive. I was very pleased to be up at Gawler the other day with a couple of farmers who were extolling the virtues of the strategic benefit payment. 

I think it's very important that the member understands that it is so critical for these people, the landholders who you would seek to represent, to get involved with the process. For example, the two landholders, the two farmers that I spoke to a couple of weeks ago up in Gawler, who both, like 95 per cent of the landholders on that line, currently host transmission. In both instances, these farmers had seen a reduction in the number of towers on their land, they had gone from 10 down to eight. These are higher towers, but there are fewer of them.

The other really important thing is fewer towers, better alignment. They had worked with TasNetworks to better align, to strategically align the towers to allow their irrigation setups to, in fact, work more productively. You would seek to corral a number of landholders for reasons known to you; I would encourage those landholders to speak to TasNetworks, to speak to their land agents to get a really good outcome for them and for their businesses and a very fair and reasonable compensation package to go along with it.

Supplementary Question

Mr GARLAND - A supplementary question, Speaker?.

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr GARLAND - This is the third time I have asked you about this issue. You still haven't answered the question. You seem incapable of giving a straight answer. Why don't you want to be truthful with the people in the north-west on this issue? Will you respect the wishes of those land owners who don't want this gigantic extension cord going through their properties?

The SPEAKER - Honourable Minister for Energy and Renewables.

Mr DUIGAN - We are being completely open and transparent. Completely open and transparent. We want to work with these people. We remain open to changing the alignment, making it a better outcome for all concerned, but we need to build this -

Ms Finlay - You can't work with them if you -

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Three interruptions in a row, this is your first warning.

Mr DUIGAN - We need to build the North West Transmission Developments, its contingent project, Project Marinus, and we will get on with doing that. In terms of acquiring land, we do not want to acquire any land, We want to acquire easements through land.

Recognition of Visitors

The SPEAKER - I would like us all to please welcome year 9 students from The Hutchins School. Welcome to parliament.

Members - Hear, hear.

Budget - Revenue from Macquarie Poitn Stadium

Ms JOHNSTON question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

[10.33 a.m.]
In your budget speech, you claim the stadium would generate $269 million in economic activity over five years. Once it is up and running, you claim it will add a further $30 million in economic activity each year. Have you sought modelling to know how much of that economic activity actually makes it into state revenue in terms of stamp duty, payroll tax or any other state revenue mechanism? Surely you have tried to work this out: How much will actually make it into Tasmania's coffers?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. The stadium will be an economic enabler, full stop. Everybody needs to recognise that. What that will do is enhance employment opportunities and how many extra people will be on extra payrolls and, as a result, get extra payroll tax or how many people will come into Tasmania to buy properties and as a result, pay stamp duty. Look, we can all speculate on that.

Suffice to say that there's no doubt there will be an enhancement of payroll tax payment and stamp duty. How much? I'm not willing to speculate and I doubt that there is an ability to exactly model that, but the good point that the member makes is that there is a recognition within her question of the increased economic activity. The only question now is how much of that extra economic activity may somehow find its way into state government coffers? I welcome the admission of the honourable member in her question that there will be this extra economic activity and I would encourage her to read other parts of my budget speech as well.

Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms JOHNSTON - The Treasurer indicates that he would only be speculating if he were to say how much would actually make it back into Treasury coffers, yet he has previously claimed that this will pay for hospitals and schools. Is that speculation as well, Treasurer, that the stadium will be paying for hospitals and schools? 

The SPEAKER - Honourable Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - Absolutely, it stands to reason that if the government gets more money in payroll tax and stamp duty then there will be more money available for those important aspects which we, as a government, have been prioritising, namely health, education and public safety, which cover 68 per cent of budget expenditure. 

I say to the honourable member that of course there will be benefit, but if you're concerned about health, allow me to quickly repeat the stats from yesterday. There are over 100 people in our hospitals - or were, on 2 September - ready for discharge into aged care or disability facilities who were unable to be discharged because of federal government neglect. We need the federal government to come to the party, pay for that, and that will be a huge relief to our health system. We are backfilling those costs at the moment. 

The SPEAKER - The honourable Treasurer's time has expired.


TT-Line - Insolvency

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.36 a.m.]
Yesterday you said TT-Line's shareholder ministers were first informed about the company's insolvency on 21 July. Who exactly was it who informed them? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I believe it was the Chair.

Mr Willie - Of the board?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes.


TT-Line - Insolvency

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.37 a.m.]
The Auditor-General has made a determination and he is an independent expert. I asked you three times yesterday, and you wouldn't answer, so I will ask you again. Are you saying that the Auditor-General is wrong in his determination that TT-Line is insolvent? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I have every confidence in TT-Line's management and board. As I said, the Auditor-General has every right to express an opinion. There has been separate advice provided to the TT-Line board that disagrees with the Auditor-General's opinion.


TasTAFE - Campus Closures

Ms BADGER question to MINISTER for SKILLS and JOBS, Mr ELLIS

[10.38 a.m.]
The recent brief 23-page TasTAFE Act review identified efficiencies through divestment and closing some campuses. The review says that TasTAFE believes it currently has excess campuses that represent a financial burden. Tasmanians are already outraged at your decision to redirect some core subsidies funding from TasTAFE to private mainland Registered Training Organisations (RTO) for courses that had waitlists here. Training options for Tasmanians are being diminished and campus closure will further reduce education opportunities. The Tasmanian skills industry shouldn't suffer further because you've failed to adequately invest in TAFE building infrastructure. Minister, which TasTAFE campuses are you looking at closing and selling?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for her question. What I can say from the outset is we're looking to invest in TasTAFE. We're looking to invest in these campuses and grow them and build them. Any member who was there at the beautiful Alanvale Health Hub expansion just over a week ago would have seen that $7.5 million investment into the key strategic training facility for northern Tasmania. It is just a beautiful opportunity for us to grow our capability and our offerings for learners. Whether you're looking to do mental health, drug and alcohol support or youth work, you can do that now through the expanded Alanvale Health Hub now. Our taypani Learner Hub will also help to break down some of the barriers that our learners might have, whether that means additional coaching and mentoring support, digital access or even just as a place to get together with other students so that you can continue to learn and work with them. 

We're seeing these kind of investments happening all around our state. The Water and Energy Trade Trades Centre of Excellence is widely regarded as one of the best facilities in the country. That was delivered at the Clarence campus. We're seeing the future expansion at the north-west Clean Energy Centre of Excellence which will be established in Burnie, backed in by major investment, through to our on-site learner accommodation. If you come from energy country down the west coast, you can go to learn in Burnie and get nation-leading opportunities. That's a $27 million investment we're working on and the funding has been delivered. People are working on site at that accommodation facility right now. We want to back in those investments.

Being an automotive TAFE student as well as yourself, Ms Badger, I know the investments made through the Budget will be delivering a new southern automotive regional training centre to replace the one that was sadly damaged by a major water leak from the Campbell Street campus. We're looking to continue to invest and grow.

At different times, TAFE has acquired a range of different facilities. That includes things such as childcare facilities that are no longer a key training provision location, they're actually being used for child care currently. We have some of those facilities around the state. There are also large tracts of vacant land that are ideally suited potentially to things like housing so that people can be well located next to TAFE centres.

We want to be reinvesting, we want to be asset and capital recycling, and growing our opportunities at TAFE. That's why we've made more than $118 million worth of capital investments in TAFE and why we will continue to grow our facilities, continue to build and make sure that the assets we have are fit for purpose for our training future.

The SPEAKER - The honourable minister's time has expired.

Supplementary Question

Ms BADGER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms BADGER - Can you clarify for us that despite the review from KPMG stating that it was looking at recommending campus closures, you are saying that you are not going to be closing any campuses, and any divestment you're looking at are other buildings or land that have been acquired by TasTAFE that are not currently being used for training?

Mr ELLIS - As I mentioned before, we want to invest in growth. There are some parts of our facilities that are no longer fit for purpose or being used for training that we think represent opportunities for us to reinvest in TAFE, because TAFE is a key driver. Our skills and training budget is the largest contribution in the Budget towards economic development. That's why we want to continue to build and grow on that. TAFE over many years has been given a whole range of different lands and facilities. We need to make sure that is streamlined, that we can reinvest in the business and continue to grow opportunities for learners right now. We will continue to look strategically at those opportunities and work through them as they present. Our goal is to reinvest in our TasTAFE campuses so that they're modern, fit for purpose and are putting the learner at the centre.


TT-Line - Insolvency

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.43 a.m.]
Will you table the advice the TT-Line has received, by the end of the day?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. I will seek advice on the tabling.


Swift Parrot - Loss of Habitat for Logging

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for ENVIRONMENT, Ms OGILVIE

[10.44 a.m.]
You are directly responsible for species listed under the Threatened Species Protection Act. One of those is the critically endangered swift parrot. We know from Right to Information documents that your department considered applying for the Lonnavale region in the Huon Valley to be designated a swift parrot important breeding habitat. However, it was noted that this would significantly impact Forestry Tasmania's revenue. On your watch, choices are actively being made about the impact on a mendicant GBE over the future of a beautiful bird on the brink of extinction. Today, real threatened species defenders, the Wilderness Society, are taking your government to court for your approval of logging in recognised important swift parrot habitat. We all know Forestry Tasmania can't make a profit to save its life. Yet, as the Minister for Environment, you're prioritising life support for an archaic industry over the survival of a critically endangered species. How on earth can you justify that?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. I noticed that you have asked me, as Minister for Environment, a question that ranges across a number of portfolios. You would be aware that I am not the minister responsible for the forestry sector. I will endeavour to give you as much information as I can from the Environment portfolio, but you may also wish to ask questions of other relevant ministers. If there's any particular - it was such a long question, more like a speech - but if there is any particular area that you feel I have not covered in the question, I am very happy to take on notice and get you more information. 

We were very pleased to release the threatened species 'what we heard' public consultation report last Sunday, 9 November, marking World Threatened Species Day - sorry, that was longer ago than last Sunday.
A brilliant scientist, who I know we all love, and our biological experts in our world-class institutions such as IMAS and UTAS, as well as land managers, local government, community organisations and individual Tasmanians had input into this question. Working together, as you know, is the key to success and the insights gathered in this document help guide the next chapter in our conservation journey, one that is bold, evidence-based, inclusive and truly innovative. We are leaning into the opportunity for Tasmanian innovation, scientific research and development. We are attracting new funding, we are investing more and we're working collaboratively to build momentum across all sectors. Now, as we look ahead, the long-awaited threatened species strategy is just around the corner and, with it, a renewed focus on modernising our legislation and technological tools.

These are indeed exciting times for Tasmania's environmental management and I am really pleased to be the Minister for Environment at this time. Under our state's Threatened Species Protection Act 1995, the Secretary has a mandate to prepare a strategy for the conservation of threatened native flora and fauna, specifying how the objectives of the act are to be achieved. This existing document was developed some 25 years ago. Recognising challenges and opportunities, as you alluded to in your question, the Tasmanian government has provided funding of $300,000 in the 2023-24 and 2024-25 financial years to develop a revised and contemporary threatened species strategy for Tasmania. A draft strategy will be released for formal public consultation.

This government has also committed, and this is important, $8 million over four years in 2024-25 and 2027-28 to establish a Threatened Species Fund to deliver conservation outcomes for threatened species in Tasmania.

I think that covers the Minister for Environment's perspective on the question that you have asked.

The SPEAKER - The honourable minister's time has expired.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker.

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - Just to raise the point for the minister: it's a pity you didn't know that Threatened Species Day was on 7 September, not 7 November.

The SPEAKER - That's a comment. Sorry, is there a question?

Dr WOODRUFF - Your department -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Dr WOODRUFF - Your department, minister, decided not to protect a threatened species' important breeding habitat and put the interests of Forestry Tasmania first. In the Swift Parrot Recovery plan you said this is an action you need to be taking now. Will you protect -
The SPEAKER - The member's time has expired. Dr Woodruff, if you go over 30 seconds, the minister is not required to respond to any commentary you make after the 30 seconds. Does the minister have any - no?

Dr WOODRUFF - Point taken, very much, but the minister did get up in the middle of the supplementary question -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Order. The member is on her feet. I cannot hear what she is saying.

Dr WOODRUFF - The minister did get up in the middle of my supplementary question and waste some of my time.

The SPEAKER - Does the minister have anything further to add to her question, please? 

Ms Ogilvie - No, but I'd be very happy to help with anything.

The SPEAKER - You can't do it from your chair, you need to rise.

Dr Woodruff - How shameful. Why are you in that role?

Ms Ogilvie - I'm offended by that and I'd like that comment withdrawn.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. This is not a time for debate or commentary across the parliament. Minister, if you have something to add, can you please come to the lectern and just make the comment, please?


TT-Line - Insolvency

Mr WILLIE question to the PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.50 p.m.]
TT-Line is a state-owned company and subject to the Corporations Act. Trading while insolvent is against the law. The auditor-general determined that TT-Line was insolvent, yet the company has continued to trade. The government have chosen to trust TT-Line over the auditor-general's expert opinion. Yesterday you said you take responsibility for all matters. If it turns out TT-Line has broken the law, will you take personal responsibility?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for the question. Surprise, surprise, I take responsibility for just about everything that happens in this place, outside of it and everywhere else, because I'm informed of your media releases every single day blaming me and getting into this and that - Armageddon again, of course.

Mr Willie - It might be a joke to you, but it's a serious matter.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I take full responsibility for all matters because it comes my way at the end of the day. When it comes to TT-Line, they're responsible under the Corporations Act. As I said and outlined very clearly yesterday about the Auditor-General's view and opinion - he's entitled to his opinion, of course, but TT-Line have their separate advice on this matter. I am very confident in the leadership of the TT-Line and the management and the fact that we have intervened and we're getting on with the job, which is clear. We did take responsibility for the challenges when it comes to the two new ships and the infrastructure, and we intervened. We sought financial advice. Now, the project is well and truly back on track.

Ms Finlay - Will you table the advice?

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, this is the third time you have interjected on this one question. That is your second warning.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Pertaining to my first answer in Question Time today regarding Treasury financial advice and the like. You can quote me on the first answer to my question.

It is great to be able to look forward to next year when those two new ships will sail up the river and the new wharf infrastructure will be in place. There will be more tourists coming to Tasmania and it will be positive. We need to keep being positive when it comes to Tasmania and its place in this world, when it comes to our visitor economy and indeed how well we are performing. It's why we believe in investments such as the two new ships. It's why we believe in investments such as the stadia infrastructure, which will be a huge boon for this state.

I urge all members of parliament to take their jobs responsibly when it comes to the stadia infrastructure. Yes, by all means scrutinise, but make sure that we do not lose this opportunity. It is an opportunity we cannot afford to lose. I am talking about people within this Chamber and those in another place when it comes to their responsibility to create something iconic and special and to drive Tasmania forward. Unlike - 

The SPEAKER - The honourable Premier's time has expired.

Supplementary Question 

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - How can the Premier just accept the company's advice and dismiss the Auditor-General's? Isn't that how you got into this mess in the first place; by listening to the company that caused it?

Mr Bayley - The same goes for the stadium. Ignoring expert advice, your own expert advice.

The SPEAKER - Order. Thank you, Deputy Leader of the Greens.
Mr ROCKLIFF - We are entitled to seek advice and we are entitled to not agree with that advice and form opinions on a range of matters. In this particular matter, TT-Line did get some of their own advice, which disagreed with the auditor-general's opinion.

We don't need to get wrapped up in the enormous negativity that still comes from the opposition leader, as was evidence in his Clayton's budget response yesterday, I have to say. The budget response, when you aren't really giving a response, or the budget response when you weren't really giving a response. No plan, no vision, no excitement, and guess what? No alternative budget. Just a commitment to being ready next time. Well, the Tasmanian people need more than just that.


Emergency Services Communication Resources

Mr Di FALCO question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

[10.55 a.m.]
While travelling throughout my electorate of Lyons, I have been concerned with the number of emergency service personnel I have spoken to that can't make or receive phone calls in emergency situations due to subpar equipment. I'm sure this concerns you as well. Our emergency services should have the best resources available. Can you commit to addressing these concerns?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank Mr Di Falco for his interest in this matter and his support for our emergency services as well. Tasmania's emergency services are some of the best that you will find. They are everyday heroes, and particularly our volunteers in rural and regional areas right across the state, giving of their time, putting themselves in harm's way, and protecting the community. We all owe a big debt of gratitude to them.

The investments this government has made in communications for our emergency services and other state agencies have actually been world leading. The Tasmanian Government Radio Network was a recommendation off the back of the devastating Dunalley bushfires. It was found that communication linkages between our agencies was very poor, particularly at a technological level. The Tasmanian Government Radio Network is a $760 million-plus project. It was delivered on time and on budget over the last couple of years. It links up communications for the police, fire service, SES, ambulance and our other land managers, like Sustainable Timber Tasmania, TasNetworks, Parks and Wildlife, and Hydro. That's enabled a world-leading capability. 

The Tasmanian Government Radio Network is the first of its kind in the world for a digital, encrypted radio network that's accessible for emergency management and state land managers. What that has enabled in the buildout of this huge project - something all Tasmanians can, quite rightly, be very proud of - is a massive uplift in our capability for communications. That is, of course, talking between our state agencies when there is an emergency, between our fire agencies when there is an emergency, but the enormous uplift in coverage and capability has been a game changer. These are not your granddad's radios. They have extraordinary abilities - the ability to send GPS locations so we can coordinate people on the fire ground or in search and rescue, and the ability to send duress warnings to other first responders if you find yourself in trouble.

Regarding the ability for first responders to be able to speak with each other via mobile phones, you're right, coverage is limited in many areas. Telecommunications are largely a federal government matter. We encourage them to continue to invest in Tasmania through the Mobile Black Spot Program. I know that for the member for Braddon, in his time, that was a particularly big passion. We, as Tasmanians, have invested in capability so that our emergency services can speak better with each other and communicate in times of need. The federal government needs to play its part to upgrade telecommunications in Tasmania's rugged rural and remote areas, so that everyone, regardless of whether they're responding to triple zero, or making a call to triple zero in the first place, have good access to communications.


TT-Line - Insolvency

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.59 a.m.]
You told parliament that Treasury met with the Auditor-General. What advice did Treasury provide to you or the Treasurer after that meeting?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I am happy to take that on notice and seek some information from the Treasurer's office. This has been some journey, as I've said. We're working our way through it. I have enormous confidence in the TT-Line board, in Chair Ken Kanofski, and, of course, Chris Carbone as the new CEO, who are doing a great job. Nothing that you can say to the negative can diminish the exciting opportunity that this is.

Tasmania is at a place where it certainly was not at 10 years ago. We've created over 50,000 jobs, we have almost halved the unemployment rate in this state. That's up to sound policy settings, but working in partnership with the Tasmanian people and businesses - unlike yourself, where yesterday you had that big opportunity to present to the people of Tasmania your visions and aspirations for this state. Now, according to your Deputy Leader, the plan is for the opposition to outwork, outthink and outpace us, so this must be the new game of Survivor for those opposite. I know that the honourable member was desperate to grab hold of an idol to get him out of a tough space, because Mr Winter actually showed some degree of energy yesterday, for once, in his Budget response, albeit I disagree with a lot of what he said, which is not unusual. What we need to see from you, Mr Willie -

Mr WINTER - Point of order - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, order. Members of the government, the member is on his feet.

Mr WINTER - I was looking forward to the dissertation, but I was hoping the Premier might answer the question that was put to him from the Leader of the Opposition.
The SPEAKER - Honourable Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Now, we know the Leader of the Opposition does not have the support of all those around him -

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question is very specific, very short, and he's way off track.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I do draw the Premier back to the question and to stop inciting interjections.

Mr FERGUSON - Point of order, Speaker, the opposition has just made a very unparliamentary remark toward the Premier. You may not have heard it. I did, and I would recommend that it be ordered to be withdrawn.

The SPEAKER - What was the comment?

Mr FERGUSON - I'm not going to repeat it.

The SPEAKER - It's very hard to withdraw a comment if none of us know - the time for Question Time has now expired. I will look at the Hansard, like I did last week, to review Hansard to see if there are any comments recorded. If yes, I will contact the responsible member and ask them to withdraw tomorrow.

Time expired.


ANSWER TO QUESTION

Budget - Revenue from Macquarie Poitn Stadium

[11.03 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Treasurer) - Honourable Speaker, I have some further information for the member for Clark, Ms Johnston. I have been reminded that once the AFL is in full swing here in Tasmania, they will have a payroll of about $44 million on which they will be paying payroll tax of $2 million per annum. Spin that out for 30 years and that is just one small area where there will be extra payroll tax and money delivered to the people of Tasmania.


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Driver Mentor Training Programs

Ms BURNET question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr KERRY VINCENT

My question is on behalf of constituents involved in multiple driver mentor training programs. These programs are vital for our community, often disadvantaged, older, those driving without a licence, or migrant community members who need their licences because family members rely on them. They ask: 'Why are we being asked to provide information on our programs by the RACT, who are also setting up a driver training program in schools and colleges? Where is our program certainty?'


Persistent Pain Clinic - Progress

Mr FERGUSON question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mrs ARCHER

My constituency question is on behalf of my constituent Bridget, who generously shared with me her struggle with chronic pain. I greatly admire Bridget and her husband for the way they manage that pain, but importantly, the way they have advocated on behalf of other people with similar struggles. I ask the minister to advise me on progress toward the Persistent Pain clinic for Launceston for the people of my community, and exactly when people will be able to receive support from that new service.


Surf Life Saving Tasmania - Funding

Mr GEORGE question to TREASURER, Mr ABETZ

Tony van den Enden at Surf Life Saving Tasmania at Mornington would like to confirm the balance of funding allocated for 2025-26 through forward Estimates to Surf Life Saving Tasmania as part of the 2021 election commitment by the Treasurer's government. Tony is concerned that Surf Life Saving Tasmania will need to cut services and programs if the government chooses to renege on its prior commitment. 


Disability Services - Spencer Logan Approval for Year 13

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER 

Recently I wrote to you about Spencer Logan, a 19-year-old Tasmanian who lives with rare neurological conditions that cause severe treatment-resistant epilepsy and intellectual disability. Spencer currently attends Hobart College Learning Centre, where staff know him well and have developed strategies to keeping safe and help him learn. In September, Spencer and his mum applied for approval for year 13, and a week prior to the end of school for Hobart College on 6 November his application was refused. Spencer is devastated. 

How does refusing a profoundly disabled young man another year in a safe and supportive learning environment align with your responsibilities to education, children and young people in disability services? Do you accept that this decision will cause Spencer distress and interrupt his development; and why was the department unwilling to make reasonable adjustments for one more year to meet his needs?


Flinders Island Airport

Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE and TRANSPORT, Mr VINCENT

My question comes from constituents on Flinders Island who are confused and concerned about the inconsistencies in information provided to people on the island about the government's commitment to funding lighting at the Flinders Island Airport. Flinders Island received a grant deed, signed it, was given a commitment prior to and during the election that these funds would occur, but then received, curiously, a letter from the Premier saying, 'Sorry, no funds in this Budget, maybe we'll consider it next budget.' 

There are two different things happening here from this government - does the left hand not know what the right hand is doing? The island has a grant deed, they've signed it, they've been told that there is money there, yet the Premier is writing to them saying there is no money and they might be considered in the future. Can the minister please advise the people of Flinders Island what the situation is with the money for lighting at the airport? 


Public Diagnostic Breast Care Centre in Hobart

Mr VERMEY question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mrs ARCHER.

The interim Budget tabled last week contains a number of health incentives that will benefit Tasmanian women. My constituent would like to know more details about the work underway to deliver a public diagnostic breast care centre in Hobart and how this investment will benefit women statewide.


Clinical Trials Unit - Service Delivery in Tasmania

Ms ROSOL question to MINISTER for HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mrs ARCHER.

My question is on behalf of a constituent who has been diagnosed with stage 4 terminal cancer. They have been able to access treatment at the Clinical Trials Unit in Hobart, something they describe as a lifeline that has given them hope when there was none. They ask why this hope is being threatened by Department of Health decisions that have seen trials withdrawn and the threat of staff cuts? Why must they now, when they are so unwell, have to consider travelling to the mainland to access groundbreaking trials that could save their life, when these trials have been and could keep being offered in Tasmania?


Coroners Office - Backlog of Cases

Ms BUTLER question to ATTORNEY-GENERAL, Mr BARNETT

A constituent from Deloraine has waited for over two years for a coronial ruling after her husband of 40 years went missing in an alleged boating incident. The Coroner's Office has advised that while the investigation is being compiled and reviewed, no date has been provided.
What is the backlog of claims at the Coroner's Office? Is this delayed ruling any way to treat a grieving family with dignity and the ability to seek resolution? 


PETITION

Ban 1080 Poison

Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I have the honour to be the bearer of an e-petition signed by approximately 1320 petitioners praying that the House call on the government to immediately ban the use of 1080 poison in Tasmania and support landholders to adopt humane and sustainable alternatives. The petition conforms with the relevant Standing Orders and rules of the House

MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Prioritising Children and Young People

[11.12 a.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I move-

That the House take note of the following matter: prioritising children and young people.

We have all heard in this place how fond the government, and particularly the Premier, is of telling us the stadium will shore up the future of Tasmanian children, as if a monolithic concrete stadium will somehow magically transform the lives of children in our state and make everything better for them. It is a long bow for sure, particularly when the stadium is going to force Tasmania into intergenerational debt that today's children will be paying off for pretty much their whole lives.

It's ridiculous to suggest a stadium will make everything better for our children. I love Rum'un, but hugging a cute mascot of a team we all love will be cold comfort for Tasmanian children in the long run. That's because paying down our debt will limit the services the government can provide, and we are seeing that in the Budget already. 

The government has boosted payments to services for children and youth, but those boosts are temporary, promptly cut in following years.

The Intensive Family Engagement Service, the highest level of support available to struggling families, designed to keep families together and keep children out of out-of-home care, gets $4 million extra for two years, then is cut. These services are currently barely able to meet the need and they will go back to that situation. There's an out-of-home care increase, a critical $15 million extra over two years, desperately needed, given decades of underfunding in out-of-home care: Two years in and the increase is cut.

The Foster and Kinship Carer Uplift is vital for foster carers who care for our most vulnerable children but are struggling to make ends meet due to rising costs of living. The uplift is funded for one year, then cut. Perhaps the government think they will have fixed the cost of living by then. 

Transition to Independence is funding that supports young people in out-of-home care to stand on their own two feet, support that is critical for young people who do not have a family to catch them when they fall. It receives a $3 million boost for two years, then is cut. For young people transitioning out of care after that two years, sorry, but it looks like you'll miss out because a stadium you can't eat or sleep in is taking priority. Services that will improve the futures of Tasmanian children will wind back before we even begin to see their positive effect. 

Then there are ongoing issues with the safety of children in our state. We have had a commission of inquiry, 191 recommendations and work to implement all these recommendations. Despite all of that, right now, young people in Ashley Youth Detention Centre are being reported as victims of reportable conduct such as physical violence and sexual misconduct.

According to the Office of the Independent Regulator's (OIR) annual report, in 2024-25, 33 young people in Ashley Youth Detention Centre were victims in a reportable conduct notification. That equates to 47 per cent of young people in Ashley Youth Detention Centre. Concerningly, five notifications were for incidents that occurred in the previous year but were not reported within that year. The OIR was so concerned about child safe practices in Ashley Youth Detention Centre, they pivoted their planned monitoring program from the community to instead focus on examining internal practices in the youth justice facility. Meanwhile, in out-of-home care, the OIR received 177 reportable conduct notifications during the same period.

It is deeply concerning to hear that even when COI recommendations are being implemented, notifications of reportable conduct continue in both youth justice and out-of-home care settings. Why are we still hearing about reportable conduct requiring investigation in youth justice and children's services?

These two things are not unrelated. If we were funding services for families and children adequately there would be less need for youth justice and out-of-home care. We would be addressing the root cause of antisocial behaviour and lack of safety in families. Investing in children's futures means not just funding short-term bubbles of investment, it means committing the necessary funding to the long term, into the future until the problems are resolved.

The government needs to drop the pretence and just be straight up with us. The future of Tasmanian children will not be transformed by the stadium. Instead, they will be saddled with debt. The government needs to get real care for children and young people in Tasmania, to prioritise services and supports and protections for the long term. To do less is to fail children and young people into the future.

[11.17 a.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice, Corrections and Rehabilitation) - Deputy Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on this important matter of prioritising children and young people in Tasmania. That is certainly a priority of our government as was demonstrated in the last few days, with our budget highlighting the importance of growing the economy, providing opportunities for work, with now 51,000 jobs since we came to office - 4 per cent unemployment rate.

Opportunities are there. There are challenges and there are opportunities, and we want to provide a place and an environment in Tasmania where there is opportunity for children and young people to thrive, to prosper, and to be the best that they can be. Of course, what we didn't see yesterday from the Labor alternative was any alternative measures in terms of the budget. No vision, no policy, no plans, nothing. It was one massive donut with a big hole in the middle. Nothing offered. Today is the Greens' opportunity to put forward their alternative budget. I have every expectation that they will do that like they have in the past. I am sure that taxes and increased levies on Tasmanian business and individuals will all cop it in the neck. In the past years, the Greens' alternative budget has been somewhat kooky, but we will wait and see today what is offered up, but it's a big contrast to Labor.

Nevertheless, in our budget, we have committed record funds, now $9.9 billion over the four years in our interim budget. Some 24 per cent or thereabouts of our total budget. We put a priority on education, children and young people. Certainly, as Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, Corrections and Rehabilitation, I want to indicate that the Youth Justice Blueprint - which I know Roger Jaensch led the charge for and helped to bring that forward and land it in 2023-24 - that came out of the commission of inquiry and there were many allegations that I don't accept from the member for Bass. Many allegations with respect to children and young people, and I want to make it clear, again, certainly on behalf of the government, that we agreed to the 191 recommendations. We are now assiduously implementing those various recommendations, the most recent, coming successfully through this Chamber, is the establishment of the Commission for Children and Young People. I am very pleased with that progress and I hope it continues to progress in the other place. Likewise, the establishment of the implementation monitor. Thank you to Robert Benjamin for the good work he is doing to keep children and young people safe in Tasmania and holding the government to account in all our various departments across this great state of Tasmania.

I want to give a big shout-out to Ms Palmer as the Minister for Education, and Minister for  Children and Youth, and thank her for her leadership and commitment. Of course she is totally backed by us and so many others because she has been assiduous in her efforts in and out of schools on a weekly basis and was responsible of course, for helping get into the budget the new Child and Family Learning Centres across Tasmania. We are pleased with that commitment and very pleased with the recent establishment of those new Child and Family Learning Centres.

The member made reference in her contribution to out-of-home care. That is included in our budget and we will see further deliberations about it in May. I know how important that is to the member and, indeed, to many other Tasmanians.

I will conclude by talking about the investment in our education system and the schools at Brighton and Legana. As a member for Lyons, I was pleased to be able to attend the opening of the new school at Brighton. It was so well received, and this will give an opportunity for not just in Brighton, but the Southern Midlands, and in and around that area. It is a wonderful investment and I back it.

[11.22 a.m.]
Mrs GREENE (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I stand here today to talk about something very important to me and that is keeping children and young people safe in this state. I have spent my working career helping children learn and grow. I have worked as an early childhood educator, served on the boards of Playgroup Tasmania and Laurel House, and stood up for child protection workers as their union organiser for a decade.

I know how tough things are for these workers, especially in northern Tasmania, which I proudly represent. They are doing their best, but the system is making it harder. Services have been scaled back or lost. There are huge vacancies in child safety, even with the extra supports that were put in last year. Support is missing and the result is longer wait-times, fewer early intervention options, and a system that is stretched far too thin.

The Ashley Youth Detention Centre is still open. It shouldn't be. For years, children were hurt there - physically, emotionally, and mentally. The government says it will close the centre in 2028. That is too far away. Every day it stays open is a day young people are at risk. Closing the Ashley Youth Detention Centre is just the first step. We need to build something better; safe places that help young people grow and heal, not just punish them. We know that this government has already cut other early intervention programs for young people who were on the wrong track.

At the same time, early help has been falling away. These wraparound supports used to be in schools and communities, but now children cannot get help when they need it most. In late 2023, students were waiting an average of 168 days to see their school psychologist. That's almost half a year. For a child in crisis, that is far too long. I said when I was elected to this place that I would elevate the voices of public sector workers. Let me share with you today some words of a worker I met with recently from child safety services. She said:

I found a baby under a chip packet. The parents were so affected they didn't know where their baby was. We see babies with several old fractures and new ones. The harm is ongoing. Some children are so malnourished they can barely stand. Their bodies are failing. We heard toddlers describe violence and things no child should ever see. I won't repeat the details here because they are too gruesome. A teenager died after years of known risk. She was referred for assessment many times and never removed. Staff, young people and her family are shattered. We're told some clear risks are just family law matters. Cases get closed just to make the numbers look better.

We don't have enough support workers or youth workers. Family time is called 'non-essential', but it is essential for keeping families connected. She went on to say, 'We are holding higher caseloads with no extra resources, communication is poor from intake to case management, and things get missed. We have kids living in cars and on the streets, not just teenagers.' She goes on to say that staff are unwell, leaving or on leave, and bullying and safety issues aren't being fixed. None of that was news to me. As their union organiser for 10 years, I would hear those stories all the time.

I've spoken to child safety workers in the North. They are overwhelmed, they're working long hours, they're handling tough cases and they're trying to keep kids safe with not enough support. They are burning out and we need to back them up. In Victoria, young people can go through a 'no wrong door' system. Wherever they go, they get support. In Queensland, community centres offer mental health, housing, education and legal help all in one place. Countries like Norway and New Zealand have built systems that care for kids, not punish them. Tasmania can do this too. We can do better.

This isn't just about fixing what's broken, it's about building something that is better - a system that sees children and young people as people to support. Children are not just our responsibility; they are our future. When we invest in young people, we invest in stronger, safer, fairer Tasmania. It's the kind of investment that always delivers a return, so I thank the Greens for putting this on the agenda for today, and I look forward to the contribution of others.

[11.27 a.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Deputy Speaker, I thank the member for Bass, Ms Rosol, for bringing this on today. It is incredibly important, particularly off the back of the Commission of Inquiry, where so many sector workers feel that we are so far behind, and they're absolutely right. The member for Bass, Ms Greene, just pointed out the closure of Ashley in 2028, when the initial commitment was 2021. The commission of inquiry also recommended that there was online reporting, through Tasmania Police, of sexual assault and abuse.

Now, what was supposed to happen is there was going to be an augmentation with online normal crime reporting through Tasmania Police that was expected to be live in November 2024. It's now November 2025 with no news of when that's actually going to happen. The funding for all of these projects is bad, it's not enough - but the project management of all of this is a complete failure, and it is an absolute shame.

Off the back of the commission of inquiry, and while we're looking at child safety, we need to be looking not just in institutional settings, but what more we should be doing so that Tasmanian children and young people are also safe in their homes. In Tasmania, it is estimated that over 30 per cent of women are experiencing violence or abuse by a cohabiting partner. That's been happening for that 30 per cent of Tasmanian women since the age of 15. That is a deeply disturbing statistic.

I note that today is National Survivors Day, so it is a good day to be having this conversation. National Survivors Day is a day that recognises and stands with survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and other forms of abuse. It honours the strength, resilience and courage of those who have experienced trauma, while raising awareness of the ongoing impacts of violence and the need for justice and the need for support.

Young women in Tasmania between the ages of 18 and 19 years old are nearly three times more likely to experience violence in a relationship than other youth nationally. That is an incredible shame on this state, and what are we actually doing in that space, to properly invest, to even have the conversation for the government to be raising this, as they need to? We know that education for prevention is direly needed, but it has to be rolled out more widely and see greater investment.

I want to acknowledge the work that organisations such as the Sexual Assault Support Service (SASS) are doing through programs such as Keeping Kids Safe. That's for education and training in schools for children, parents, teachers and other professions that are working to prevent sexual harm, because we know that intervention programs, particularly on harmful sexual behaviours, have quite a high success rate compared to some other programs that we still need to work on more. Why wouldn't we be putting more investment into that now, to create a safer environment for our children, and to be rolling that out through all schools, not just capping funding and rolling out through a few as a gesture. They should be in all schools, and that should be completely invested in at full capacity by this government. It's a choice that they've made not to do that.

Of course, early intervention is not only making Tasmania safer now, it's making Tasmania safer into the future. That's not just because it's changing behaviours in young people and they'll be learning how to have safe and respectful relationships with other people. These are young people that are also observing current family, domestic and sexual violence in their homes. 

We know that family violence across Tasmania is still increasing, and that's a hard statistic to pin down, why that might be. It could be because women feel safer and more aware of support systems and therefore are more comfortable calling police and reaching out for help. There could be just a stark increase where neighbours are calling police to attend incidents that they're hearing or seeing. Either way, it's inappropriate. It's not good enough to be having this higher statistic. We should be working as fast as we can towards a decrease.

Now, that was the point, to help set up a joint standing committee on family, domestic and sexual violence so we could actually see parliamentary intervention, apolitically, across both Houses of this parliament. I note that the order that was sent from this place some weeks ago is just sitting in the Legislative Council. I know everybody's busy, but this is an epidemic in this state, and we have to do something to fix it now.

There is not enough investment, and we have to turn our attention to it. It's difficult, but we can't turn a blind eye to it. It's simply not good enough. We need to see a future in Tasmania where we have enough rapid rehousing that is appropriate for families, for children, so that they can keep living a somewhat normal life. Wouldn't it be great to have an Arch-style centre for family and domestic violence as well?

[11.32 a.m.]
Mr JAENSCH (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I thank Ms Rosol for bringing this item today prioritising children and young people, and I acknowledge the matters raised by other speakers. I would like to address a couple of specific points raised by others, Ms Rosol in particular, and the repeated reference to programs being cut. These programs are not being cut. They have been committed funds, and they will be continuing. However, it is sensible for programs that have funding allocated for a period of years to be also periodically reviewed and their funding renewed. If you look at the history of the IFES and the transition to independence programs that were referred to you, you'll see that's been the case again and again. These are now integral and successful components of our child safety system, and it's irresponsible and inaccurate to say that their funding is being cut.

Separately, there was reference to reporting and investigation of concerns raised with regard to young people in detention associated with the independent monitor. Any complaints or allegations around inappropriate behaviour or assaults on young people are always taken seriously and are cause for concern. The good thing is that in contrast to some of the circumstances and periods of time referred to in the Commission of Inquiry, there is now competent machinery to hear those concerns, to investigate them, to independently oversee and monitor them, as evidenced by the reports that you've referenced and the people responsible for giving them.

I do expect that there have always been, and sadly, there is always a risk and will always be, of young people being harmed and occasioning harm to each other in environments where there are a lot of people with complex behaviours. The most important thing is that we can hear their concerns and complaints. They can be directed through independent means. These are the things that weren't in place during the periods that were reported through the commission of inquiry. They are now and we will continue to improve them through the Commission for Children and Young People and other mechanisms.

There was anther contribution from the member for Bass, Mrs Greene, and I join her in acknowledging the work done by our extraordinary child safety workforce and the circumstances they encounter, which is why they're there, sadly. We need them to be good at what they do and we need them to be supported by colleagues.

In response to some comments made about the workforce, the information in front of me is that child safety officer staffing levels have increased statewide by approximately 25 per cent since September last year, and as at 8 October this year, there were 110.4 FTE occupied for a vacancy rate of zero statewide. This is something we need to keep on in this very challenging area of our work to ensure we are attracting and retaining the people we need and we have a pipeline of suitably qualified and motivated people with the right attributes to continue doing this important work.

This government, over our time since 2014, has prioritised children and young people possibly more than any preceding government. We introduced institutions such as the independent Commissioner for Children and Young People; the Strong Families Safe Kids reforms, reducing the number of children and young people entering out-of-home care and coming into contact with the statutory child safety system; and an advice and referral line to assist more people to reach out for help when they need it, rather than being simply a process through which people could be reported when it was perceived that they were having difficulties with raising children safely. We've extended out-of-home care support to young people to the age of 21, assisting them to make the transition into independence, as we would for our own children. There is the Ticket to Play program, our commitments to early learning literacy and our Child and Family Learning Centres.

[11.37 a.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to talk on this MPI, prioritising children and young people, and thank Ms Rosol for bringing it forward. I want to focus on one of my portfolio areas, specifically housing, because we are in a housing crisis and we know that a safe and secure roof over children's heads is a fundamental basic tenet for them having a good start in life. It goes all the way to having security around school and access to school, access to friendship groups and access to, literally, a sense of security.

We know that here in Lutruwita/Tasmania we have a housing crisis. We are not meeting our responsibilities to deliver housing for families and children, when housing is a human right. This is a deep shame on us as a state and as a community, because we can and should be doing this. It's a matter of choice, a matter of priorities about where we put our infrastructure spend. To go over some of the statistics that have been prosecuted in this place already but need to be said in the context of this debate, we have 5336 applicants on the public housing waitlist. Many of these applications would include families and children who are desperate for a secure place. These applicants are waiting up to 100 weeks and this is simply not good enough.

We know there are challenges within the housing stock and we know there are fundamental challenges in the model that has been established with Homes Tasmania and public housing in this state. We know it is a a system that is absolutely struggling, not only to meet the needs of Tasmanians, but it's struggling under the new structure.

The Budget this year has demonstrated how the government is shifting its responsibilities to fund public housing off the general government sector books and putting it onto Homes Tasmania. Debt for Homes Tasmania will go up from $500 million this year to over $1 billion in 2028-29 at the end of the forward Estimates. That's going to cost Homes Tasmania $25 million to service this year and $50 million to service in 2028-29. We know this is creating a serious problem in the capacity of Homes Tasmania to actually build the houses, and that's why we're seeing, unfortunately, figures fudged. 

The government has a noble target of 10,000 new - let's call it 'new' because that's what the policy commitment was new - public and affordable houses by 2032 and we know that as they report on progress to those targets, they are reporting crisis accommodation, they are reporting private land sales and other, I guess, illusions that help make up the numbers and pump up the tyres of the numbers that Homes Tasmania is delivering. This isn't good enough. We need to be better. We need to be more honest with our community about what we are delivering to them and how we are delivering this to them. 

This was writ large in the context of the security of children just last week when Anglicare released their report, which showed that, very distressingly, the number of children in families seeking support has grown by 60 per cent since the same period last year. That's a 60 per cent increase in families with children seeking support. This comes on top of some other shocking statistics in that report, including an 88 per cent increase in the number of people sleeping rough. We know there are families sleeping rough. We are know there are single women escaping domestic violence who are sleeping rough with their children. That's not just in cars or tents, that's couch surfing and in insecure and unsafe accommodation. There's been an 88 per cent increase in people sleeping rough, full stop. They're on the Domain, they're in cars, they're under the Tasman Highway, and they're in people's backyards and on their couches. 

There's been a 54 per cent increase in people living in unsuitable dwellings. They're freezing cold, they're mouldy and the like. That's why we need more protections for renters. We need rent controls, we need minimum standards so those homes are warm, we need no-cause eviction protection so that those children and families can live securely in their homes. We need this because children deserve it. We owe this to future generations because they need the best possible start in life in this state.

[11.42 a.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I will make my comments brief, but I'm very pleased to be able to speak to this matter of public importance and we've heard some some cracking contributions already. One of the concerns I have as as part of my portfolio responsibilities is access for young people to proper and suitable public transport. We know, and we've heard from various young people, that sometimes they cannot get to school because there are no buses to take them. They cannot access their education because there is not the public transport in place, which should be in place - they live close enough to to public transport routes and and bus services - but those bus services have been sliced, cut out, and they haven't been reinstated.

This is a huge shame. Not only do they have lack of access, but sometimes they cannot access bus services because they don't have the suitable passes. I know the former transport minister, Mr Abetz when he was in that role, looked at some of those concerns for bus passes for students, but students should have the right to access good, suitable public transport and this is not what we're seeing. We're seeing services not replaced when they were cut some time ago. 

Our Metro services are being run into the ground and it's not good enough. It's not serving those young people who should have a bright future and who should have access to their education and other services they need to access. It's a shame and an indictment on this government. It should be that we have a robust Metro service that is properly funded and suitable to serve those young people. 

[11.44 a.m.]
Mr GEORGE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I hope you will forgive me, I have just jotted down these notes in my phone. Tasmania stands at an important juncture in its responsibility to children and young people. While the state possesses natural advantages - close-knit communities, accessible services and the scale that allows for innovation - persistent challenges in education, health, housing and youth wellbeing suggests that much more can and should be done. A genuine commitment to young Tasmanians requires not only policy change, but a cultural shift that treats children as central to the state's social and economic future, rather than as an afterthought in political debate.

One of the most pressing areas for improvement is education, of course. Tasmania continues to fall behind national outcomes on literacy, numeracy and retention to year 12. Closing this gap requires early intervention, not remedial responses. Universal access to high-quality early childhood education, especially in communities experiencing disadvantage, would help ensure that children start school ready to learn. Within the school system, better support for teachers, smaller class sizes, and targeted programs for students who are at risk of disengagement can significantly improve long-term trajectories.

Moreover, expanding vocational pathways, apprenticeships and industry/school partnerships like TAFE would open diverse options for young people whose strength may not align with traditional academic roots. Health and mental services also require sustained investment and reform. Tasmania's youth's wait times for mental health support are still far too long and services are unevenly distributed across Tasmania's regions.

A coordinated youth mental health system that integrates schools, primary care, community organisations and child safety services, is essential. Embedding mental health practitioners in schools, funding youth friendly community hubs and improving telehealth access for rural and regional areas would reduce the barriers that young people face when seeking help. Similarly, improved paediatric services, better access to allied health professionals -

APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 2025 (No. 63)

Second Reading

Continued from 11 November 2025, page 97.

Mr FERGUSON - Honourable Speaker, so as to not detain the Leader of the Greens for too long, I want to conclude my opportunity to address the budget. I was saying when I sat down last evening that the investment in health infrastructure and workforce is vital. It is appreciated by me. We are now seeing at the Launceston General Hospital (LGH), in particular, benefit of years of planning and investment being realised. In particular, I mentioned the surgical robot when we had a last budget debate. I'm pleased to tell you that it is now in place, it is being used by our surgeons and it's changing the lives of both men and women. Across the north, upgrades are continuing in our hospitals and community health facilities. They are not always headline projects in glossy brochures, they're practical, carefully staged investments about expanding capacity and, of course, expanding access to safe services and reducing wait-times. I believe that's what Tasmanians want, that's what I want, and that's what the government is delivering.

This budget also takes a disciplined approach to repairing the state's finances while protecting essential services. After a year of political instability, the Treasurer has put the ship onto a steady course. The operating deficit is being reduced responsibly, not recklessly and not, as I said last evening, with knee-jerk reactions. The debt profile remains manageable, but I will say it cannot continue unchecked. The debt profile remains manageable and we need to keep it that way. Return to balance is an important priority that the Treasurer Abetz has identified, together with the Cabinet. We want to do it the right way, not by slashing services as I have seen occur in the past, but by growing the economy and supporting jobs and essentially maintaining confidence.

In all of the roles I have occupied in opposition and in Cabinet, I've always advocated for minimal borrowing and conservative fiscal management, especially in the area of operational expenditure. I have to say that there are many reasons that get overlooked by critics of the government. The reasons for the debt profile should be agreed, understood, and not politicised.

They include our record infrastructure program; the COVID-19 response, which saved lives, businesses and our future; the commission of inquiry, historical civil liabilities from decades old sins with reparations being attempted today; long-term superannuation obligations; and the additional investment needed in health and child safety. I want to name them up; we must understand and agree on those reasons for our debt profile and not politicise them unfairly against Tasmanians.

Looking ahead, as the Treasurer and the Premier are saying, the future must involve careful review of operational expenditure and that requires discipline not only from the government, on this side of the Chamber, but also from the opposition and the crossbench. As I said before, one day the government is criticised for debt and the very next day those same people are demanding that spending be significantly increased.

The Treasurer has been very clear about his priorities: health, education, housing and community safety. These are the building blocks of a fair, prosperous and resilient state, and they're backed by careful allocations to achieve these goals for a safer, happier society and one where our economy allows Tasmanian families to plan for their future with confidence and to make long-term plans to remain Tasmanians and add to our way of life.

As I conclude, I thank the Treasurer, the Premier, the cabinet and all of those who have contributed to this budget. In so doing, I think that there is a quite a large number of members from the crossbench who, for the first time, have had at least some engagement, some insight and, arguably, some input into the development of those priorities.

I look forward to hearing what the Leader of the Greens has to say in her alternative budget. That is not a sarcastic comment, it can't be made, however, without pointing out that the opposition have a responsibility to produce the alternative budget. Instead, today we look to the Greens for their opinion. 

I commend this budget to the House and on behalf of my families in Bass, I support the work of the government. 

[11.53 a.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Bass, Mr Ferguson, for his comments. I will be speaking on behalf of the six Greens MPs from the true opposition in this House, the crossbench. A position that the Greens are proud to hold in this parliament.

I acknowledge that we are listening today on the lands of the Muwinina people, the country of original owners and custodians of the lands around Kunanyi and the shores of Timtumili Minanya. On behalf of the Greens, I pay my respects to all Palawa/Pakana and their elders. We recognise that this country was stolen and was never ceded to colonisers and Aboriginal people have never ceded their rights to law on Country. Since colonisation, they have continued to demand justice through treaty, land returns, and protection of culture across Lutruwita/Tasmania.

Last year, the Premier met with community elders, looked them in the eyes, and made a commitment to progress truth-telling and treaty. It was a welcome announcement that the Liberals did fund a truth-telling commission, but it was totally overshadowed by their announcement that they would be abandoning their promise of a treaty. It is a massive betrayal of Aboriginal people and another broken promise from a non-Aboriginal person in power. Uncle Jim Everett, puralia meenamatta, was crystal clear before he walked out of the reconciliation breakfast in June. He said, 'Don't give up on us, put treaty back on the agenda.' I am calling on the Premier to fulfil his promise to Aboriginal people and follow the lead of Victoria, who recently legislated a treaty, and to commence that process here forthwith.

As representatives of our communities, the central question we all need to ask is what would a good government do for Tasmanians in this Budget? A government that cares for this island and its people, a government that values the amazing world around us and that believes in fairness and justice, a government that knows it has a responsibility not just to Tasmanians now, but with an eye to future generations? This is always the starting point for the Greens. During the state election, we showed what's possible if the government got its priorities straight and focused on addressing these questions. With the policies we announced, we showed it is possible to invest more in the essential and underfunded services that Tasmanians rely on instead of making massive cuts, at the same time as raising the revenue that's needed to set the budget on a path of repair. We showed it is possible to care for nature - the very thing that makes Tasmania so special in all the world - and to support jobs in our cities and our regional areas.

The election policies that we took to Treasury were fully costed by them and they improved the bottom line by $1.4 billion. We didn't do that by cutting services, which the Treasurer has said has to happen. In fact, our plan invested more into health, housing and other essential areas. How did we do it? We did it by stopping the vote for a stadium, by scrapping misguided spending, and by making big corporations pay their fair share. That's what a good government should do.

Before I give more details on behalf of the Greens MPs about our vision for Tasmania and how we'd pay for it, how we'd walk back the gross debt burden that the Liberals have laid out for future generations, and how we'd do it in a compassionate and future-focused way, I want to address the accusation the Premier made about us yesterday in Question Time. He said that every question the Greens ask is 'Armageddon by nature.' By implication, the Greens are always describing the worst of things. Premier, we don't apologise for being truth tellers in this place or strong advocates for change. We represent people's concerns in the community. We represent the voices of scientists and independent experts. We speak about the unvarnished reality of how things actually are. We're forthright about what the government needs to do to fix things. That's because the people who elected us expect us to fight for real outcomes, and real outcomes mean making things better in the community's interests, not prioritising corporations and their profits or Liberal mates.

Tasmanians overwhelmingly want strong government services and democratic institutions, and that's because when the chips are down - and they sure are down for a lot of Tasmanians at the moment - when you don't have a house to mortgage or private health insurance to get you into the surgery you need, you have to have public and community services there to back you. Tasmanians also overwhelmingly want to make sure that the laws we have are for everybody. They want to make sure that we have strong institutions to make sure vulnerable people, like children, are protected. 

Premier, we won't stop talking about the harsh realities of daily life for more than a quarter of Tasmanians who are totally overwhelmed by the cost of living. They struggle to pay their bills. At least 81,000 among us are skipping meals every day and going hungry. While the government prioritises some $70 million in debt servicing a year for a stadium, which is what the Coordinator-General has proposed, tens of thousands of people are literally going without food. People who call an ambulance when they're desperate are still waiting longer in Tasmania than they would in any other Australian state. Our children have the worst literacy and numeracy in the country, and there's no extra money in the Budget to help children struggling in school who are falling behind on reading and writing. There's nothing there for extra teacher support or the wellbeing of staff. As for the Premier's rhetoric about kids who are dreaming big and the prospect of a stadium in the future, right now children literally can hardly dream about a future with a good job if they can't read and write, they haven't got food on the table and they're worried about their housing. 

Not to mention adults in Tasmania with the lowest functional literacy rates in the country. This Budget this year has the last funding for the essential work of the 2610 literacy program. That is an outrageous shame. It is a cut that Treasurer Abetz has put into this budget and there's no commitment to that in future years.

That's why we are so opposed to how the Liberals have written their priorities in black and white. They're making cuts in short-sighted and harmful places to community and essential services, they're shielding multinational companies from paying their fair share of royalties to bring in the revenue we desperately need and they're continuing to subsidise retrograde and harmful GBEs like Forestry Tasmania and racing. But perhaps the most worst is that they are choosing to fund a third stadium when over 2800 State Service jobs are right on the cutting list, according to Treasurer Abetz, and there are over 5000 people on the housing waiting list who desperately need a home, the highest level ever in Tasmania.

Anglicare's Social Action and Research Centre's recent figures about housing and homelessness in our state are very damning. There's a growing number of Tasmanians who are living in conditions more commonly seen in developing countries because there's no housing they can afford here. The number of Tasmanians seeking housing support since last year has increased by 34 per cent.

The CEO of TasCOSS, Ms Picone, told the community sector that government spending on the stadium could pay for a house for everyone on the housing waiting list, or an energy efficiency upgrade for every single Tasmanian household. Just let that sink in. This interim Budget of Treasurer Abetz is heartbreakingly out of touch. It will have brutal impacts for Tasmanians because he's told us that it's nothing compared to the austerity cuts he is committed to next year. Despite what Labor says, they're backing in this Budget through their unconditional support for the stadium.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Sorry to interrupt, Dr Woodruff, but I remind members of conventions in this House: when the leaders of the party speak, we do so in respectful silence. I note that Dr Woodruff was silent for both the Premier's and the honourable Leader of the Opposition's speech, so I ask that she is shown the same courtesy, please.

Dr WOODRUFF - As the Leader of the Opposition has said time and again since Labor backflipped on its original opposition to a stadium, they will give their unconditional support to the Liberals and they will back it, whatever the cost.

Mr Willie - I've never said that.

The SPEAKER - Sorry, Dr Woodruff. Honourable Leader of the Opposition, there are other forms of this House that you can use to address the comments of Dr Woodruff. Again, I repeat, there are to be no interjections and you can take this as your first warning for the day because I have already asked for silence during the honourable leader's speech.

Mr WILLIE - Point of order, Speaker, personal offence. I haven't actually said any of those things. 

The SPEAKER - If you want to address the personal offence, you can do that on Adjournment today.

Dr WOODRUFF - Do an Adjournment on the stadium.

Mr Willie - I have not said either of those things. I ask her to withdraw.

The SPEAKER - You will have an opportunity to address it at the end of this speech.

Ms Finlay - That's not how personal offence works.

The SPEAKER - It is to do with the order of business, which is before the House. Sorry, Dr Woodruff, I apologise for this interruption to your speech -

Mr Willie - She's saying mistruths.

The SPEAKER - Mr Willie, I have asked for silence during Dr Woodruff's speech. You can have an opportunity to make a personal explanation at the end of this order of business, which is at the end of when we deal with this appropriation bill. It is not appropriate to do so now. Thank you, Dr Woodruff.

Dr WOODRUFF - Thank you, Honourable Speaker, and it is very telling that Labor are arcing up on this matter. I'm really happy to speak to the Leader of the Opposition personally and lay out all the times he has made those statements to the media. I remember, I was there.

Mr Willie - Where?

Ms Finlay - Find evidence of one. Put it on the record once.

The SPEAKER - Ms Finlay, this is your third and final warning for the whole day.

Dr WOODRUFF - This budget, with these essential service job cuts and the thousands more to come, shows the real cost of the stadium that Labor is willing to support, because this budget is concreting in $2 billion extra in debt across the next decade and it will likely steal $7 million out of the operating costs to pay for the interest on that debt year on year. In case people don't understand what that means, the operational bit of the budget - Labor and Liberal members - is the part that should be funding nurses and teachers. Essential public workers are being denied a fair deal for pay and conditions by the Liberals right now. Teachers and nurses are being forced into industrial action to get fair compensation. From community gardens, Neighbourhood Houses, family violence services, commission of inquiry initiatives, and TasTAFE arts and lab-tech course cuts, millions are being clawed back from those who need it the most. 

This is just the beginning of the Liberals' stadium austerity era. The Liberals have started the sweeping cuts through their so-called Efficiency and Productivity Unit (EPU) - the DOGE of Tasmania. That's Liberal-speak for cutting thousands of jobs and ushering in lower-quality services for Tasmanians. It comes complete with a Hunger Games-style portal for staff to recommend cuts. Only Treasurer Abetz, who has championed downsizing the public service for decades, could, without shame or apology, deliver a budget that cuts 2500 jobs and promises another 300 next year. Only the Tasmanian Labor opposition could be so lost in the wilderness that they would support the stadium and the Budget's harsh austerity that it ushers in.

Who will feel the brunt of these efficiency cuts? Will it be cleaners in hospitals? People who roster shifts in Ambulance Tasmania? School receptionists? Teachers' aides? Housing support workers? It's no-one but the Liberals who believe their spin that Tasmania is in rosy economic circumstances. We are literally being lampooned on the mainland for the parlous shape of our debt crisis, and it's entirely predictable for those of us who've been around for the last 10 years of this Liberal government. The Greens and many others in the community have called out the naked pork-barrelling by the Liberals in the 2018 and 2021 state elections, as did the Integrity Commission. According to esteemed Australian economist Saul Eslake, these two election spending sprees added $1.4 billion to the budget without any plan by the Liberals about how to pay for it.

Treasury also warned about the financial impact of these spending pledges and the worsening of Tasmania's financial position without inaction, but were roundly ignored. Saul Eslake has also said Tasmania's debt - $19 billion across the government and GBE sector - will now be larger than any other state or territory as a proportion of our economy, and that the Liberals' election spending has made things so much worse. This is money that should have been spent on the most urgent, future-focused jobs, on preventive and mental health to slow the burden on the hospital system, and on environmental protection and restoration. What's painfully clear is the Liberals can't be trusted to manage money. They can't be trusted to manage government businesses; TT-Line is insolvent, the Spirits was an epic financial disaster and it's still going on. After 11 years, the Liberals have destroyed the budget.

However, it's not too late to improve the trajectory. There's still time for Liberal members, and Labor members - who seem much more concerned with trying to concoct a Standing Order to shut down this uncomfortable conversation about themselves and their response to the Liberal's Budget and to the stadium. I would like, and hope, that Labor members, along with Liberal members, will look at themselves and will wrestle with their conscience, because it is an opportunity to do what you know is the right thing. This stadium is not a foregone conclusion. It is not. Every member can look into their conscience. Labor members who I know are unhappy with a vote in favour of a stadium can cross the floor and vote for a better budget outlook. You can make a decision about the future of this Budget, because adding a stadium and $2 billion of debt will not chart the ship of Tasmania into safer waters. It will not. It will entrench austerity.

Future generations deserve a government who will act in the face of a climate and biodiversity crisis. It's not the Greens who are talking about Armageddon and the disastrous future which could be in front of us. The national and state climate risk assessments have told the government that the climate threat is pressing, needs real and urgent action, and that Tasmania, of all the states in the country, is at higher risk of extreme events like bushfires, floods, sea incursion and very high and damaging winds. The Liberals, in their Budget, have not only ignored the threat, they've gone backwards on their previous climate change funding, which was woefully tiny. The Treasurer has seriously underfunded the Tasmania Fire Service, State Emergency Service, Parks, and forestry firefighting services, even with the knowledge that more intense fires are threatening communities, especially in big populations like Hobart. He slashed funding to the climate office by more than $7 million a year, which for everyone - and especially young people - is alarming.

The Liberals have long been blind to the beauty and value of our globally unique forests. They look at Tasmania's incredible biodiverse and carbon-rich forests and see them, sadly, as a resource to plunder and exploit. In fact, the Treasurer referred to them in his Budget speech as 'nature's bounty'. Overwhelmingly, communities across Tasmania want to defend those precious forests from logging and burning. They are worth so much more to us all standing. They're valued for their ecosystem benefits; the beautiful and extraordinary plants and animals that are unique on planet Earth. They're so important for human health and wellbeing and spiritual sustenance, and they are critical stores of carbon. People don't want their taxes to be used to pay for a destructive Forestry Tasmania industry. Those millions, every year, should go into homes, health, education, and to keeping a healthy environment.

State budgets are a reflection of a government's priorities, and it has never been clearer that this government doesn't give a damn about the environment. The State of the Environment Report last year painted a very serious picture about the environmental damage of a decade of Liberal policies. The government's own words from the Planning Commission's report were:

… investment in the management of Tasmania's environment and the implementation of these recommendations must be considered on a scale that is equal to the scale of the current and emerging environmental challenges. 

Climate change and the loss of our natural world and its biodiversity are the greatest existential threats ever faced by humans. This government is prioritising money not on restoring and protecting nature and stopping the damage and destruction, but to spending on a football stadium - a third football stadium that we can't afford and don't need. Not a single recommendation from the State of the Environment report has been funded in this Budget - not one.

These essential services that I've talked about are critical for securing the fortunes of all of us now and in the future. What are we, who are we, as a community if we can't keep our children safe from abuse? If we can't give them a home? If we can't give them an education to give them the skills and the creativity and the adaptability and resilience they will need to live in this rapidly changing world? To pass on the beauties of nature that we are lucky enough to enjoy, and are surely custodians of, for the future generations?

Doing that costs money, and the Greens have done the work to identify where the government should cut unnecessary spending and raise the dollars to pay for it. Stopping the stadium is obviously a huge saving, and while the Liberals, with the unconditional support of Labor, are pushing ahead with the stadium, we've always been clear that this project is the wrong priority for Tasmania. By stopping the stadium, we will save the state from $2 billion in debt. That's a huge hit to a budget that's already breaking under the weight of its own borrowings. It's not just the debt itself, it's the interest repayments - up to $70 million, the Coordinator-General flagged.

Going ahead with the stadium could be - it is, obviously, in terms of the Budget - the worst possible thing that the government could do in this debt crisis. However, we acknowledge that stopping the stadium doesn't fix all the problems that the Liberals have brought on us. The Treasury's pre-election financial outlook from June this year said that Tasmania has a structural budget problem. We're spending more than we earn and the gap is growing. We all need to advocate to increase revenue and find savings, and we can't rely on economic growth to get us out of the problem that the Liberals have created. Treasury was clear about that. The Liberals have consistently failed to bring in enough money to the budget every year and that's why in the recent election, the Greens announced a range of important measures to bring in more revenue and to reduce spending in unnecessary areas.

We made three major budget repair announcements that showed where the government could and should be finding those funds. These were detailed policies fully costed by Treasury and included royalties for salmon farming and mining, a fair tax rate for poker machines, and levies on property developers. Each of those were recommended by economists, already happening in other states, or both. These three policies achieve just under $950 million in extra money that could be coming into the budget every year. That is a huge figure. Again, I will point out that we submitted all our announcements for costing usually on the same day we made them, but by a couple of days from publications. Of the 49 we submitted, Treasury was able to release a costing for 40 before the end of the election period. That was a stark contrast to the Labor opposition. The net variation from their costings to our overall budget result with all the policies we submitted was only about $2 million a year. You might call our policies kooky, as the Liberals have done, but Treasury called them facts.

In terms of other savings, we propose significant measures across a range of areas. For example, every year the government funnels nearly $40 million of taxpayer money into propping up the racing industry. By ending that practice, we could save the budget $155 million. That sure is a lot of community and essential service jobs. We would save another $48 million over the forward Estimates by ending subsidies to the destructive native forest logging industry. In all, we recorded savings of $1.6 billion without making any of the sweeping cuts to public and community services that the Liberals are doing.

The Liberals have delivered a budget that makes cuts to services, but they still won't fix the state's financial woes. In fact, they will make them far worse from the harm they will cause. Labor have complained and talked about what they want to happen, but they haven't presented any solutions. 

The Greens have shown in our budget election pack that it is possible to do things differently and better. Essential services can get more of the support they need, not less. We can be heading, as a state, to a sustainable footing environment, socially and economically. These are some of the fantastic and funded policies that we took to the election: building 200 more public homes every year; hiring 80 more community nurses and allied health staff and expanding mental health services; developing a 10-point plan to clean-up fish farming; making public transport free, frequent and reliable; making public school free by abolishing school levies; expanding the Wilderness World Heritage Area and employing the rangers, field officers and fire crews necessary to protect it; establishing a taskforce to crack down on real estate industry malpractices; investing more in TAFE facilities and staffing, not cutting courses or selling facilities; supporting farmers to reduce their carbon emissions; and building a new training centre for nurses.

By not funding the stadium and the Liberals' other misguided priorities, and by making big corporations pay their fair share, it is possible to fund all these policies and many others, and to improve the budget bottom line by $1.4 billion and that's the Greens' vision for Tasmania and it is one we will fight for every day.

We are very conscious of the debt the Liberals are walking us into. This will be a drain on the government's ability to respond to community needs for a generation or more and that concern has always been the principal reason we will not support building a new stadium, along with the destruction it would obviously cause to the centre of Hobart.

Our policy commitments at the election, costed by Treasury, show that we have a commitment to generating revenue and to finding serious savings. We do the work and it is the Greens and the crossbench who are functioning as the opposition, standing up to this government in parliament and showing there is an alternative path that is fiscally responsible, that's caring, and that puts the future interests of Tasmanians first.

Honourable Speaker, ours is a real and positive alternative vision for this island, Lutruwita/Tasmania. I am proud to announce it today and also to table the savings that we announced at the election, as circulated to all members previously.

Paper tabled.

Personal Explanation

Member for Clark, Mr Willie

The SPEAKER - Before I call on the minister who gets the call, the Leader of the Opposition has asked, under Standing Order 127, to make a personal explanation.

Mr WILLIE - Honourable Speaker, there were some accusations in that speech about things I said which that I have not said. I have never said that we are giving the Liberal Party a blank cheque on the stadium and I have never said that we are giving them unconditional support. That is a misrepresentation, a mistruth, and I ask the member to withdraw it.

The SPEAKER - Because I did not want to interrupt the Leader's speech, I ask that the honourable leader withdraws those comments. 

Dr WOODRUFF - Honourable Speaker, I cannot do that without going back and checking the record because my memory - our memory - is that the honourable speaker did say that.

The SPEAKER - You have been asked to withdraw the comment. I will review the Hansard myself, but I ask for now that you withdraw the comment and we will review the Hansard to see what was actually stated.
Dr WOODRUFF - Yes, I am happy to withdraw. For clarity, does that mean that if any member doesn't like something that's said in this Chamber, they can get it withdrawn without having a personal explanation? I thought it was only grievances.

The SPEAKER - I intend to review the Hansard and I will update the House tomorrow at Question Time as to what was stated and go through what is personal explanation versus what is withdrawal and what is personally offensive, because misrepresentation comes understanding Standing Order 127. Standing Order 144 is when it is personally offensive.

Dr Woodruff - Thank you, honourable Speaker, I look forward to that because that could be used to shut down any form of criticism in this place. I can understand why Labor is so soft-bellied about this particular one.

The SPEAKER - I agree and I hear what the member is saying, so that is why tomorrow before Question Time, I will be outlining to the House, after the review of the Hansard, exactly what is personally offensive and what is a misrepresentation; because misrepresentation is handled understanding Standing Order 127, while personal offence is under Standing Order 144.

Mr BARNETT - Honourable Speaker, on the point of order, I'd like to question the accuracy of the comments by the Leader of the Opposition and ask that those views be carefully assessed in your assessment overnight and report back tomorrow; because I question the views of the opposition leader and I'd like him to back it in with evidence.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I will take that as a comment
———————————————————
[12.23 p.m.]
Ms HOWLETT (Lyons - Minister for Tourism, Hospitality and Events) - Honourable Speaker, I acknowledge my colleague, the honourable Treasurer, Eric Abetz, and thank him and his staff for all the work that they have done to put together this interim budget.

The government is focused on delivery and building a strong Tasmania now and into the future. This is an interim budget that continues to deliver for Tasmania. It invests in health, education and community safety; it continues to strongly support our job-rich visitor economy sector and our racing industry; supports the prevention of sexual and family violence; and, importantly, invests in job-creating, intergenerational infrastructure.

To ensure that government can support and care for Tasmanians, we need to keep building and growing our strong economy. Our plan is to make Tasmania the best place to live, work, raise a family, invest and do business. The interim budget is also delivering for our tourism hospitality events sector, which is a key driver for our economy and our way of life. Tasmania's visitor economy is one of our state's biggest success stories. It contributes $4.5 billion to our gross state product and supports almost 51,000 jobs. That's one in six Tasmanian jobs and one in three across regional Tasmania. In the year to June 2025, 1.35 million international and interstate people visited Tasmania and we are working together to grow Tasmania's job-rich visitor economy to keep moving our state forward. The Budget includes $10 million for tourism marketing for the next financial year. This provides Tourism Tasmania the certainty to secure critical media contracts to deliver award-winning Come Down for Air and off-season campaigns.

A total 90 per cent of visitors' mode of departure is by air and through our Aviation Attraction Fund we are driving increased visitation to Tasmania. It was great to recently announce that we have unlocked a brand-new direct route between Hobart and Newcastle in partnership with Hobart Airport and Jetstar. It will begin on 2 December, adding over 26 000 seats.

The Budget also enables us to continue delivering on our Spirit Support Package. We are on track to deliver the Spirit Preparedness Program. The program guidelines explicitly state that the business applicants can expect to be notified in December and that hasn't changed. 

We have also delivered on our election commitment to recommence our Eat Local, Stay Local program. Eat Local, Stay Local is giving Tasmanian tourism and hospitality industries a valuable stimulus. Since that program resumed, more than 20,000 Tasmanians have submitted their claim for a $100 voucher, spending more than $5.2 million on top of their voucher amounts. 

Our Budget also includes ongoing support for Hospitality Tasmania and the hardworking hospitality business operators right across our state. In 2024 we committed $8.4 million over three years to Hospitality Tasmania through the Hospitality 2030 Strategy to deliver initiatives to build and grow the job-rich hospitality sector.

These include the Great Customer Experience, Hospo Health and programs focusing on business sustainability and workforce development like the Women's Leadership Scholarship program. There is continued support for the Tasmanian Hospitality and Tourism Academy to address skills and labour shortages. Our support reflects our commitment to the hardworking hospitality business operators right across our state. 

We are continuing to see improved accommodation occupancy rates in Tasmania. The continued upward trend in occupancy since December 2020 is testament to the government's long-term support for the industry. The recent hotel occupancy report acknowledged the second-best August and winter period on record. Hospitality Tasmania CEO Steve Old said: 

We are heading into summer on a real high. Confidence is building and these results show Tasmania is firmly on the radar as one of Australia's most desirable destinations. [tbc]

Our Tasmanian Government Event Strategy 2023-2027 continues to deliver on strong return on investment in the state and the Budget continues its support for events. Events drive visitation to Tasmania, especially through quieter months, building local communities and culture and supporting our tourism and hospitality businesses. 

In the 2024-25 financial year, the government supported a total of 155 events. This support brought over 129,200 visitors to Tasmania and generated almost 750 bed nights. The Budget also provides funding over 2025-26 and 2026-27 for important major partnerships, including the Hawthorn Football Club agreement renewal. With plenty of small business experience on this side of the Chamber, we will always back them to the hilt and that is what this Budget does.

In relation to women and the prevention of family violence, now combined under one budget output, this means greater alignment of our efforts in this vitally important portfolio area. I'm pleased that the interim Budget continues to support women and the prevention of sexual violence and family violence. While the words 'prevention of sexual violence' may not be in my title, I'm fully focused on this very serious issue as a fundamental part of my work in this portfolio. 

My aims are to give Tasmanian women and families the respect they deserve and putting their priorities and needs above politics, doing everything I can to reduce the risk of violence to Tasmanian women and families and improve their safety and keeping my focus on putting a family and sexual violence lens across government actions and programs. As parliamentarians, we should all share these aims for the sake of Tasmanian women and girls and for the broader strength of our community.

Under the federation funding agreement for family, domestic and sexual violence responses, the federal government has allocated more than $29 million to Tasmania, which is in addition to our own investment of over $140 million under our third action plan to address family and sexual violence. The Tasmanian Family and Sexual Violence Alliance, our new peak body, was jointly funded in April this year by the Tasmanian and Commonwealth governments. We're also committed to the development of the new Tasmanian government Family and Sexual Violence Action Plan with a strong and collaborative approach. 

This Budget also provides funding for International Women's Day small grants programs and the Women in Leadership scholarship program. The Women in Leadership program is designed to address the underrepresentation of women leaders in male-dominated industries. We've made some really strong progress but we know that there's more work to be done.

In my portfolio of Racing, the interim Budget supports improved integrity, animal welfare and the overall wellbeing of the industry. It also supports a transition plan to phase out greyhound raising in Tasmania by 30 June 2029 and I tabled the legislation for that transition last week. The passage of the landmark racing regulation and integrity legislation late last year delivered a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose model, abolishing the old framework. This new model is supported in the 2025-26 interim Budget and delivers on our previous election commitments and it's working, honourable Speaker. 

The Budget also includes $720,000 across four years to support the new Racing Integrity Committee which is critical to the new model. It also provides an initial provision of $500,000 to support the greyhound racing phase-out implementation. The independent Tasmanian Racing Integrity Commissioner, Mr Sean Carroll, is developing a comprehensive framework plan for the transition and this resource is there for his work.

The government continues to honour the racing industry's 20-year funding deed which expires on 30 June 2029. This is a reflection in the interim Budget across the forward Estimates in table 9.2, page 160, budget paper no. 2 of volume 1. I'm working closely with the Treasurer as shareholder minister in Tasracing to see a new deed finalised and that work is underway. We have a strong interest in the racing industry and the need for certainty and we are getting on with the job. 

I'm pleased that the Budget delivers important investment into the many urban and regional communities that make up my beautiful electorate of Lyons. The opening of the new Bridgewater Bridge proves that we can deliver big infrastructure programs in partnership with the private sector, supporting hundreds of jobs. It's going to serve the people of Tasmania for decades to come and has been built with the future in mind. So too will the Macquarie Point stadium be built with the future in mind and it will serve the people of Tasmania for decades to come.

In conclusion, this is an interim budget that continues to deliver for Tasmania with the future of the state in mind. This Budget backs business, supports jobs, supports families and builds stronger and safer communities. I commend the bills to the House. 

[12.34 p.m.] 
Mrs GREENE (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to give my contribution on the interim Budget presented last week. Budgets are a declaration of priorities and choices, and the choices being made in this Budget are repercussions of poor decisions this government has made over the last 11 years. 

We're in a mess because of cost blowouts on projects like the berth and the Spirits, because of the overuse of consultants, because of a broken complaint system in the public service that doesn't deal swiftly with employment matters, often resulting in workers compensation claims for psychosocial injury and lengthy, expensive investigations. We're in this mess because of poor workforce planning and pork-barrelled election promises.

My first thoughts when I read through the Budget papers was that this Budget appears to be treading water. It keeps us afloat, but it takes us nowhere. A budget should be a vessel that brings us forward. I, like many Tasmanians, are concerned about our rising debt. The Budget demonstrates that this government has no plan on how to deal with it, other than sacking public sector workers and delaying promises that those opposite made to the community just a few short months ago. 

Reading through it, it's evident that this Budget doesn't invest in workers, it doesn't strengthen services, and it doesn't inspire confidence for the future. When we cut jobs and weaken services, we're telling workers that their contribution is expendable. We're telling communities that their needs are negotiable. When we invest in people, we build a stronger, fairer state - one where every worker has dignity and every family has security. That's why this Budget fails. It fails the vulnerable Tasmanians. It fails children and young people. It fails people desperately waiting for housing. It fails public sector workers and the community services sector, the very people that are holding this state together. It fails because this Budget is built on cuts, broken promises, and debt.

Those sitting opposite have been at pains to say in the last week or so that Labor is negative. It must be in their talking points for this week. Well, I would love to hear a plan and some positivity from those sitting opposite, because I can't see a coherent plan from this government on how to move our state forward. I was hoping to hear that from the Treasurer last week, or indeed from the Premier yesterday. Exactly what is his ambition for our state? Tasmanians want to know what the future has in store for them. 

The Premier has overseen a budget crisis and has put the honourable Treasurer, Mr Abetz - the man who cut 14,000 commonwealth jobs - in charge of fixing it. Tasmanians know what that means: it means cuts to jobs; it means cuts to services. The Treasurer says he reduced the size of the federal public service through natural attrition. That gives me no comfort when he talks about 'right-sizing' the Tasmanian public sector right here in Tasmania, because calling it natural attrition doesn't make those job losses any less real. It's not attrition if you've planned for it and it's not natural if you've budgeted for it. Someone still has to do the work. It doesn't disappear when someone retires or if they burn out. Whether you cut the role or you let it die slowly, the impact on Tasmanians is exactly the same: fewer people delivering services that all Tasmanians rely on. 

With 2800 jobs now on the chopping block, there will be serious consequences for our communities. Cutting public sector jobs is a choice that reshapes communities, and it narrows opportunities for Tasmanians. We must ask, whose future are we protecting with these decisions, and whether saving dollars today will cost our communities more in social and economic harm tomorrow.

The Treasurer has been spinning and sidestepping and pretending that these so-called savings won't hurt frontline services, but anyone who's ever worked in the public service, or relied on the public service, knows the truth. I'm not just worried about frontline services. I'm worried about the public sector workers that keep our communities ticking: court clerks, flood planners, project officers, auditors, research officers, library workers, compliance investigators, payroll officers, and administrative staff. We know that they are the staff that are most likely to be hit first. The government thinks they can cut those roles and that nobody will notice, but our community will notice, especially in our regional towns, where those jobs are so important. 

Departments have been ordered to freeze jobs, delay recruitment, and quietly let vacancies build up, and it's already having an impact. Now, the Budget also assumes a 2.5 per cent wage increase for public sector workers, even though the government's already made an offer of 3 per cent, and it will need to be a lot better than that for unions to agree.

The Treasurer, Mr Abetz, has admitted he has told agencies to find savings to make up the difference and that's on top of a $300 million efficiency dividend which, by the way, is the laziest way that the government can actually make changes, where what we really want is those structural changes. That's what needs to occur. Really, you're just asking departments to tinker around the edges.

CPSU general secretary Thirza White said of the Budget, 'It's a fantasy document; a renamed efficiency dividend with no vision for reform,' and I agree. Thirza went on to say that it's a slash-and-burn plan that risks privatisation and big job losses. I agree with that, too, because the fact is that public sector workers are being short-changed to pay for Liberal mismanagement. This government keeps talking about efficiencies and savings, but out in the real world, things are already falling apart, and now, while workers are struggling to keep up with rent and mortgages, groceries and bills, this government is dragging its feet on fair wage negotiations. A take-it-or-leave-it offer tells us everything about this government's attitude to workers - they would rather dictate than negotiate.

The Minister for Education, Children and Young People got up in parliament just last week and said that unions gave their log of claims in September and took strike action in October. In actual fact, public sector unions provided their log of claims for the Public Sector Union Wages Agreement (PSUWA) on 20 May 2025. The log of claims for allied health workers in her department - that's the child safety officers, school social workers and speech and language pathologists - that was also provided on 20 May.

When the government say they can't afford a fair pay rise, what they really mean is they've chosen not to. Over the last few years, they've found money for consultants and reviews that go ignored, they've found money for glossy advertising campaigns, they even found money for a chocolate fountain which, thankfully, is no longer on the cards. What we've found out over the last week is that they're telling us they can't afford to give public sector workers - the people who keep this state running - a decent pay rise. They've even cancelled their bargaining meetings, because they don't want to hear from workers and their worker representatives.

Now, we know that cuts to the public sector will also have an impact on the community services sector. TasCOSS said this interim Budget was 'simply a vehicle for the government to bide time' 'with a thinly veiled warning of the need to find savings and efficiencies'. They also said government expenditure should be prioritised to essential services and supports that enable Tasmanians to fully participate in the economy. COTA Tasmania, representing older Tasmanians, said of this Budget: 'There's a lot of noise and not many changes.' When organisations that support the most vulnerable say that this Budget is noise and delay, we should listen, because they are connected to communities and deeply understand the needs of Tasmanians who rely on us to make good choices.

It is evident that this Budget is not just about public sector workers being squeezed, it's the community services sector too. These are the organisations catching Tasmanians when government systems fail - neighbourhood houses, homelessness providers, family violence services and youth programs. They report that cases coming through the door are increasingly complex, which is not a surprise. They are keeping people fed, housed, safe and alive while running on grants that don't even keep up with CPI.

Funding is indexed at a rate that doesn't match the rising costs of wages, rent, fuel, electricity or insurance, the basic costs of providing support. When indexation doesn't cover inflation, it's not 'holding funding steady' - it's a cut. I look forward to seeing the progress from community minister Ms Ogilvie on longer funding contracts for the sector, because you can't build stability with a 12-month contract. You can't fix disadvantage with funding that expires every June 30. The sector doesn't need gratitude. It needs certainty. It needs real indexation. It needs contracts long enough to retain staff, plan ahead and focus on helping Tasmanians, not just surviving from one funding cliff to the next or having to come up with a new shiny project each year. If we want strong communities, we must fund the people who strengthen them.

Tasmanians are bearing the cost of incompetence from this government. Tasmania will spend nearly $2 billion on interest repayments in just a few years, around $500 million a year. We are now spending twice as much on interest repayments as we spend building homes for Tasmanians. We need a plan because the debt and cuts will have consequences. In our classrooms, educators are already sounding the alarm. President of AEU Tasmania David Genford said educators have lost confidence. The budget does nothing to address violence, heavy workloads, or burnout. Classrooms are already running on empty, but this government refuses to listen. Schools are just expected to do more with less. Teachers are exhausted and leaving the sector, workers compensation claims are increasing, and kids are missing out. Despite the handful of scholarships finally being provided for allied health professionals in schools, there is a long waitlist of students who need support from a speech and language pathologist right now. Those scholarships are too little, too late.

School social workers are stretched between four or five schools, despite the Australian Association of Social Workers recommending a ratio of 1:500. That means that kids are missing out on the support that they need. They are falling through the cracks.

I cannot help but feel nervous that the Treasurer's budget will lead to privatisation by stealth. We know he likes small government. He told us that last week. When a government freezes recruitment, refuses to fill vacancies, demands ongoing efficiency dividends and deliberately underfunds workforce growth, it creates a crisis that can then be used to justify outsourcing and privatisation. If you hollow-out the public sector for long enough, someone will eventually say, 'The public service can't cope, we will have to bring in the private sector.' That is privatisation by stealth.

I note this government already has form on this because just this year they outsourced a very large body of work in child safety to Tradewind. This time last year the advice and referral line had a backlog of 2000 calls relating to abuse and neglect of children. I notice I have just got your attention, because it's true. Your face is going the same colour as my jacket. Rather than adequately resourcing this service, you outsourced the waitlist. Outsourcing child safety work, the most sensitive, trauma-informed work of government, is nothing less than a disgrace. Children deserve continuity; they deserve stability. They deserve trusted relationships with trained case workers who live in the state - who aren't in Melbourne or in Sydney. They deserve people who are here, who are Tasmanians, who understand our communities. You should be ashamed. No wonder you're on the backbench now. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The only one who has the call at the moment is member for Bass, Mrs Greene.

Mrs GREENE - Thank you, honourable Speaker. They deserve better than a revolving door of short-term contractors hired to meet KPIs. That decision sent a clear message to Tasmanian public sector workers that this government would rather funnel money into private labour-hire companies than fix its own workforce planning. It was panic spending, and our kids deserve better.

Mr Jaensch - We removed the backlog and fully staffed the service.

Mrs GREENE - Shame. You know what, a lot of that backlog was in the north-west coast, where you are. You knew you didn't have workers there, in your own backyard. Those workers told you. I know they did.

Every Tasmanian deserves good public services. Every single one of us - I will come to you next. The healthcare that treats us when we're sick; the schools that educate our children; the emergency service workers that protect us: SES, Tasmania Police, Tasmania Fire, radio dispatch services - I will have to tell you later how many phone calls dropped out yesterday because there was no-one to answer the phone - forensic science service; biosecurity workers who are protecting our island state; and the Parks and Wildlife officers who protect our environment and support tourism in this state, which is extremely important for our economy.

These are not luxuries, yet, under our Premier, Jeremy Rockcliff, these services are stretched to breaking point. Hospital staff are burning out. Beds are blocked because radiology and pathology departments remain understaffed. Wages are simply not competitive enough to retain workers. That is why, I note, the last Health minister provided a market allowance for those workers. That will need to continue until the allied health professional agreement is signed-off on. As I said earlier, that log of claims was provided to the government on 20 May, so they have been waiting for six months, 70 per cent of all clinical decisions made in a hospital require a diagnostic test, like a blood test or a scan, but these critical teams remain under resourced. People, therefore, do not move efficiently through our health system, and don't get the support that they need. Those opposite know it is true, but they haven't done enough to resolve it.

Our courts face relentless backlogs. Victims of crime wait months, sometimes even years, for the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to review their files. That is a poor outcome for workers and our community - justice delayed not because of the law, but because of staffing shortages. That is a threat to community safety.

This is not a government that values public services and the Budget proves it. It treats the public service as a cost to be cut, not as an investment in our future. When you treat services as expendable, you treat the people who deliver them as disposable. Tasmanians deserve better, and so do the workers in these critical roles. They deserve respect, resources and a government that stands with them.

Tasmanians trust us to educate their children, to keep them safe in hospitals, to deliver homes and provide fair, reliable services across the state. This budget breaks that trust. It undermines frontline capability and threatens regional equity. It shifts costs onto workers, families and communities.

Tasmania deserves a government that invests in people, not one that sacrifices them. If we choose to invest in workers, protect the vulnerable and strengthen the services that underpin our communities, we will build a Tasmania that inspires confidence, attracts investment and gives every person the chance to thrive. That is a legacy worth leaving and that is what our state needs.

[12.51 p.m.]
Mrs ARCHER (Bass - Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing) - Honourable Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the 2025-26 interim state Budget. This includes our record investment of nearly $10 million every single day into our health system, which will ensure we continue delivering better care to Tasmanians when and where they need it most.

Health now makes up more than a third - 34 per cent to be exact - of the entire state budget, which clearly demonstrates that the health of Tasmanian families and communities remains our number one priority. The budget includes over $70 million over the next four years to implement our new four-year elective surgery plan. It was launched in June and follows our first four-year plan, which saw a record number of elective surgeries delivered for three years in a row and the highest per capita admission rate for elective surgery of any state or territory.

Last financial year alone, more than 22,500 elective surgeries were carried out, around 61  every day. That is on top of the emergency surgeries that occur across our hospitals every day. Our targeted investment ensures we can continue this momentum so that more Tasmanians receive their procedures sooner.

We are also investing in more doctors, nurses and paramedics, along with a range of significant infrastructure investments. We are continuing to rebuild Tasmania's hospitals and health facilities to ensure that staff and patients have access to world-class facilities and technology, alongside a boosted workforce.

Over the past 11 years, we have invested more than $1 billion in new hospitals and health infrastructure. The interim budget builds on this with over $770 million invested across the forward Estimates, which includes redevelopments at all our major hospitals.

In my electorate of Bass in the north, the budget locks in funding across the forward Estimates for our 10-year Launceston General Hospital master plan, as well as funding for the new Northern Heart Centre and the Kings Meadows Community Centre redevelopment. In the south, our investment will deliver a number of upgrades at the Royal Hobart Hospital, including an expanded emergency department, a new Public Diagnostic Breast Care Centre, and the redevelopment of the pharmacy. We are also progressing with the St Johns Park Health and Wellbeing precinct, including a 12-bed child and adolescent mental health inpatient unit and day facility, and a 15-bed adult mental health centre. In the north-west, funding is allocated toward the first stage of the Northwest Regional Hospital master plan, including a new mental health precinct and upgrades to expand the emergency department and ambulance drop-off area. Funding is also provided over two years for the Devonport Mental Health Hub, which will offer a safe haven, recovery college and integration hub. The Budget also locks in funding towards our new and upgraded ambulance stations, with works to deliver Longford and Bicheno underway, and planning and design is well advanced to deliver stations at King Island, Legana, Cygnet and Snug.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=26.2_D=17.1_C=0.84] I'm particularly proud of our government's strong commitment to women's health in this Budget, including $3.8 million to expand services at The Bubble, a dedicated women's health clinic in Launceston, ensuring women can access antenatal, pelvic health and gynaecological services closer to home. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=44.1_D=17.9_C=0.79]  This builds on major initiatives for women's health, including the $4.7 million surgical robot at the Launceston General Hospital, which commenced operating in September, and planning for new permanent breast screen clinics across Kingborough, Devonport, Triabunna and Glenorchy already underway.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=63.4_D=14.4_C=0.84] On 25 September 2025, World Pharmacist Day, I was pleased to reaffirm our government's commitment to further expanding the role of community pharmacists as part of our ongoing plan to improve access to healthcare for Tasmanians. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=78.9_D=6.8_C=0.75]  We will provide postgraduate training scholarships that will allow pharmacists to receive full scope of practice credentials. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=86.5_D=12.5_C=0.88]  This means that they'll be able to provide even more care in our community, by treating common health conditions such as ear infections, reflux, rhinitis, and skin conditions such as shingles, eczema and wound care.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=100.3_D=12.6_C=0.80] We've already made oral contraceptive prescriptions and treatment for UTIs more accessible through our pharmacy scope of practice reforms. This is practical, commonsense policy that makes life easier for Tasmanian women.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=114.3_D=9.6_C=0.74] I want to thank our health workforce: the nurses, doctors, paramedics, allied health professionals and countless support staff who serve Tasmanians every day. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=124.7_D=7.5_C=0.88]  I've had the privilege, in my short time in this role, of witnessing first-hand the compassion, professionalism and resilience of our healthcare staff. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=133.2_D=11.4_C=0.86]  Tasmania has more healthcare workers per capita than any other state, thanks to the government's investment over the past decade, and we are backing them in with the infrastructure they need to deliver world-class care.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=145.7_D=19.1_C=0.81] We are also making significant investment to support the mental health and wellbeing of Tasmanians through our long-term Rethink 2020 strategy and the development of Rethink and Beyond, we're transforming Tasmania's mental health system to one that is community focused, integrated and person centred.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=165.9_D=14.3_C=0.91] Over the past decade we've invested $564 million to shift the focus on services from hospital-based care to community-based support, ensuring help is available earlier and closer to home. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=180.9_D=15.7_C=0.79]  This year's Budget commits a further $62 million over four years for mental health and alcohol and drug services, including to meet rising demand, to support the Royal Hobart Hospital's Mental Health Short Stay Unit and continue our alcohol and drug reform agenda. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=197.3_D=10.0_C=0.81]  We're also continuing our valued partnerships with community organisations such as Lifeline Tasmania, Relationships Australia, Movember and Home Base.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=208.1_D=14.5_C=0.84] The Mental Health Council of Tasmania will receive $400,000 for its Lived Experience training hub and $125,000 for its Take a Minute campaign, ensuring that the voices of lived experience continue to shape our reforms. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=223.7_D=13.8_C=0.83]  Our mental health and alcohol and drug workforce have grown by 54 per cent since 2021, an extraordinary achievement supported by our Health Workforce 2040 plan, which is building a strong, sustainable workforce in the future. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=238.4_D=8.3_C=0.87]  Through these actions, we're delivering on our promise to build a mental health system that is modern, compassionate and accessible for every Tasmanian.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=247.8_D=11.3_C=0.85] Before I move on from Health, I want to again highlight that while we are investing record amounts, the federal Labor government must step up and meet its funding commitments under the National Health Reform Agreement. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=259.9_D=13.0_C=0.86]  Their latest offer would see Tasmania face a $673 million shortfall over the next five years, which is equivalent to not providing about 128,000 elective surgeries [Bookmark: Phr20_O=273.6_D=4.1_C=0.87] , or 1.2 million emergency department presentations. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=278.5_D=16.9_C=0.84]  Every dollar the federal Labor government shortchanges Tasmania's health system needs to be stumped up by the state, and we are already doing the heavy lifting with over $50 million being invested into primary health services by the state government right now, and counting.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=296.5_D=8.5_C=0.90] Every single state and territory is united on this issue, the majority of whom are Labor states. I ask that all members here, especially the opposition who have so far been silent, to stand with us and demand our fair share of health funding from the federal government.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 2025 (No. 63)

Second Reading

Resumed from above.

Mrs ARCHER (Bass - Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing) - Honourable Speaker, in continuation, it's an honour to stand here today as Tasmania's first Minister for Ageing. This new role signals our government's deep commitment to ensuring older Tasmanians are not only supported but celebrated. With over 40 per cent of Tasmanians aged over 50 and one-in-three expected to be over 65 by 2050, ageing is not just a demographic reality, it is central to our identity as a state.

Our Older Tasmanians Action Plan 2025-2029: A Respectful, Age-Friendly Island, sets out a clear vision - one of inclusion, participation, health, and respect. We're backing the plan with funding to oversee and implement its actions, including the creation of a governance group that will give older Tasmanians a direct voice in policy design. We're also delivering on Lifelong Respect: Tasmania's strategy to end the abuse of older people 2023-2029, reinforcing our commitment to the dignity and safety of older Tasmanians.

The Budget allocates funding for the new 40-bed older persons' mental health facility at St Johns Park, which will bear contemporary, compassionate space designed to meet complex needs and deliver specialised care. We're also continuing the redevelopment of the Midlands Multi-Purpose Health Centre, adding eight new beds for residential aged care and expanding our successful care-at-home model, ensuring older Tasmanians can receive expert care in their own home. 

Through strong partnerships with organisations like COTA Tasmania, we're tackling loneliness, building digital literacy, and celebrating the enormous contribution of older Tasmanians in our communities. Our approach to ageing is about dignity, participation, and possibility. The government will work to ensure that older Tasmanians can live enriching and healthy lives.

Finally, in relation to my portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs, this interim budget reaffirms our strong commitment to Closing the Gap and improving the lives of Tasmanian Aboriginal people, with $4.4 million invested to progress this important work. This includes our commitment to establish Tasmanian Aboriginal truth-telling and healing commissioners to begin a Tasmanian Aboriginal-led journey towards truth-telling, healing, and relationship building with Tasmanian Aboriginal people and the broader Tasmanian community. The establishment of the truth-telling and healing commissioners will be uniquely Tasmanian, and it is a very important historic moment of recognition, respect, and self-determination for Tasmanian Aboriginal people. This is a first for Tasmania and one that reflects our commitment to listen, learn, and act.

The Budget also locks in funding for the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre and the Tasmanian Regional Aboriginal Community Alliance, enabling them to continue their leadership and advocacy in Closing the Gap initiatives. We're also supporting Reconciliation Tasmania with $400,000 over four years to continue their vital community engagement and education work. Recognising that economic empowerment is a cornerstone of reconciliation, we're also investing $200,000 a year into the Palawa Business Hub, creating pathways for Aboriginal businesses to grow and thrive, and strengthening the Aboriginal Land Council of Tasmania with an additional $150,000 annually to continue its vital work as guardians of land, culture, and heritage.

In closing, I'm pleased to support the 2025-26 Interim State Budget, which reflects our government's commitment to delivering the best possible outcomes for Tasmanians in all corners of the state.

RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

The SPEAKER - I welcome in the gallery year five students from The Launceston Preparatory School. Welcome to parliament.

Members - Hear, hear.
———————————————————
[2.34 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, it gives me perverse pleasure to stand up and talk about the 2025-26 interim Budget and some of the warped priorities of the Liberal Government, and match that against the desperate needs of everyday Tasmanians. This is called an interim budget, but really, it's an incomplete and ill-conceived budget that has more holes in it than substance. It does bolster the privileged, it abandons the needy, and it demonstrates this government's priorities and choices, and they are truly something that we do not support. Before I get into the details of the Budget, I acknowledge and thank our Treasury staff. I know there's a huge amount of work that goes into a budget. This was done in a compressed time frame, and while we criticise this Budget strongly, we are not criticising their work, because we know they are under instruction from the Treasurer and they are professionals - frustrated professionals perhaps, but professionals. I acknowledge and thank them for their work, and for the briefings and other information that has been provided.

We know that the Treasury staff could be frustrated professionals, because when they are unfettered by the Treasurer and his viewpoints, they do give some very, very frank advice. The Pre-Election Financial Outlook (PEFO) this year was some of that very frank advice indeed. It demonstrated, and Treasury made it very clear, that the Budget has a structural problem and that we simply cannot grow our way out of this structural problem. Whenever the Treasurer talks up the Macquarie Point stadium as the shining white knight that's going to ride in and save the Tasmanian economy, he's saying that directly counter to his own Treasury officials' advice. 

They also say that explicit policy choices are required, and that we need sustained and immediate action to rectify the Budget. They raise the significant risk of a credit rating downgrade; both S&P and Moody's have got Tasmania now on a negative watch. They are watching the deficit and indeed the debt levels, and if indeed they do downgrade our credit rating, that's going to make credit more expensive and servicing our debts more expensive. As we see our debt going through the roof over the forward Estimates, that's going to have a very significant impact on our bottom line. While the government like to talk about savings and efficiencies coming out of the general government sector, they don't like to talk about servicing the debt, and the fact that the debt is serviced from the general government sector. 

A good way to make savings every single year, year on year, is to not put ourselves into profound levels of debt, as is happening under this government, particularly in a stadium era. The PEFO has identified that there are costs and uncertainty associated with the stadium. We won't know how much it costs until it is contracted, and they acknowledge that there is a really tight construction mark at the moment, that there's a bespoke roof design, and that the cost of related projects continually blow out. We see that time and time again, some of them not even major construction projects. We heard today about the blowout in the ticketing system in the metro. I mean, how can that be?

The Treasury have also identified that there is uncertainty around the $240 million federal contribution to build urban renewal at Macquarie Point. It's tied to housing; it's not tied to a stadium, and so the Treasury, quite rightly, raised the risk about what happens if that housing condition does not get met. More on the stadium later. 

I want to touch firstly on the budget panel by Treasurer Abetz and say that it has been a welcome and currently useful process for me as a member of the crossbench. It helps me to gain access to Treasury, to improve budget literacy, to try to understand, and have the ability to directly question Treasury and the Treasurer - not on the public record albeit, but nonetheless it is useful. The terms of reference of that budget panel are really clear. It makes it abundantly clear that the budget is an instrument of executive government. That means that government owns the budget, so we can't get blamed for these bad decisions. The government isn't consulting, taking our view and putting it into the budget. The true value of this panel won't necessarily be known until next year, but we're under no illusions that this government is going to suddenly hear those consultations, take our advice and put our advice into any future budget. The government makes a virtue out of ignoring feedback from consultations, so we're under no illusions there. In the meantime, it's a useful platform to gain more information, and we'll continue to participate in it until we're given good reason not to - which is a warning, I guess, to the Treasurer and others not to abuse that panel, and to use it in the spirit of why it was put up in the first place.

The Budget has already been called out very clearly by members in this place, and I want to add to that. It's quite shambolic, it's a bit fraudulent, it's a mirage. As it says, it identifies a modest $5 million surplus at the end of the forward Estimates, but it has no genuine pathway to get to that surplus and we are inevitably going to loop back to a deficit. What we have seen in past budgets is consistent underbudgeting and supplementary appropriations needed. In this Budget, we are seeing forward Estimates just blanked out from programs and initiatives that we can't believe would or should be defunded, so it's highly likely that in the next budget they're going to get numbers plugged into those figures and that surplus in the forward Estimates is going to miraculously disappear.

Then, of course, there are the efficiency dividends. The Efficiency and Productivity Unit (EPU) has been established to identify those efficiency dividends and there's significant uncertainty around the ability of government to be able to deal with that, so it's a highly problematic budget that I think is based on false pretences and even though it has baked-in cuts and is deserving of significant criticism, the surplus, at the very least, is completely fraudulent.

The Treasurer identified peak debt and the fact that we're going to reach peak debt by the end of the forward Estimates. Peak debt is when Tasmania earns enough to cover the costs of debt servicing, which means we don't need to borrow simply to service our debt. That is currently a mirage. If we only have a surplus of $5 million in the forward Estimates, there is no way we are going to be able to meet the needs of servicing our debt, not least building debt, layering debt upon debt with a stadium. The Treasurer's speech has peak debt as a pipe dream because the debt is going to be serviced from the general government sector.

Debt is currently at $7 billion and by 2029 it is going to be $10.4 billion, so there is no way we are going to be able to meet those needs by own-source revenue, which is why people such as Saul Eslake and others are identifying the need for policy change so that we can increase the revenue that this state earns and can actually fund the services that Tasmanians deserve and meet our commitments when it comes to the debt that needs servicing.

The other thing with the debt that has been highlighted in here already is that that $10.4 billion is simply the general government sector and, of course, the government businesses are borrowing as well. We are seeing a situation where we are going to continue to need to assist government businesses to meet their financial needs. There has been a big debate in the House over the last days about TT-Line, its solvency and otherwise, but it is really clear that government businesses and taking government departments like Homes Tasmania off the general government sector books is simply a way of hiding debt and covering up the need to service those debts.

Homes Tasmania's debt burden will double over the next five years, from $500 million today to $1 billion by the end of 2029 - $25 million to service now, $50 million in 2029. Macquarie Point is projected to borrow $490.7 million to build the stadium by 2031, and that's not assuming the inevitable cost overruns that will come with a toxic, constrained site and the other issues associated with that site. 

The cost to the general government sector simply for servicing that Macquarie Point debt, the $490 million, doesn't include the $375 million the government is going to borrow to inject as capital, but simply to service the Macquarie Point debt, means we are going to give them $21.9 million in 2029-30, $30.7 million in 2030-31, and $32 million in 2031-32, and we can assume that that $30 million price tag simply to service the debt for the stadium will be ongoing, because with no credible plan to pay off that debt, these are going to be annual costs baked into our government sector. These are going to be the costs that we have to pay at the same time as we are sacking nurses and teachers and health professionals. As to the credit rating that I mentioned before, if our credit rating is downgraded, it makes it even worse. 

I want to touch on Labor because Labor's position has been nonsensical when it comes to debt and support for the stadium. We've heard Labor members in here rail against the level of debt, rail against the cost of servicing debt, and yet are blindly supporting $2 billion being added to that debt burden at least over the next 10-years.

Similarly, regarding expert advice, we've heard our question after question from the Leader of the Opposition today about the the Auditor-General, about the TT-Line, about whose advice who believes, whether you believe the chairman or the Auditor-General. If you want to have a conversation about listening to expert advice, let's have a listen to the Tasmanian Planning Commission.

It was very unedifying to hear the interjections from the Leader of the Opposition during the Leader of the Greens' contribution, arguing about whether there's been unconditional support given for the stadium. I would really welcome a Labor member telling us what condition has been put on their support for the stadium, because it hasn't been whether it costs a billion dollars or $2 billion or $3 billion, it hasn't been whether or not the Planning Commission would support it - and of course the Planning Commission unequivocally said that it should not be built.

Saul Eslake said that this government can no longer blame COVID or the commission of inquiry recommendations but that these are active policy decisions, including election policy decisions, that are driving this Budget into crisis. It is clear that we need to change track. We need to drop unnecessary expenditure like the stadium and we need to increase revenue generation.

The Leader of the Greens went through our election commitments quite clearly that found a billion dollars' worth of savings, raised $900 million worth of additional revenue and when you factored in the additional expenditure that we included in the election, the budget was $1.4 billion better off. It has to be done because, as Treasury has said, we can't grow our way out of this crisis and we need to make active policy decisions.

On some portfolio areas, starting with the Environment, we are in a crisis. We had fires last summer that burnt 100,000 hectares. We had a marine heat wave, and we had the catastrophic and tragic incidence of mass salmon mortalities that impacted on so many beaches in the state. We've got extinction being a reality. We've got the swift parrot, the skate, we've got the blue wing parrot recently been uplifted and literally last weekend we've had the curlew sandpiper and the Alaskan bar-tailed godwit uplisted to endangered here in Tasmania. These are species that rely on a healthy environment for survival, and when it comes to the swift parrot, the Minister for Environment's answer this morning was utterly underwhelming.

The swift parrot recovery plan that this government signed identified that we needed to protect habitat from logging. The State of the Environment Report identified that we need to protect public land to save threatened species, yet the government is not acting on its own recovery plan in terms of stopping logging in critical habitat and when it comes to the state of the environment recommendation, it's pointing at private land conservation and yet it's not even adequately funding it in the Budget. The State of the Environment Report was a dire prediction that things are going to get worse unless we turn the ship around.

The National Climate Risk Assessment highlighted that Tasmania was one of the most at-risk states in the country for climate impacts, yet funding for climate is down from $10 million to $2.8 million at the end of the the forward Estimates.

This government talks up net zero, but let's be real, the only reason we have reached a net zero status is because of the forest protection that was delivered over a decade ago. That is why we have net zero status. The EPAs has no increase despite a need for increased regulatory challenges and we need more improvement when it comes to the legislation that underpins the Environmental Protection Authority. It needs more teeth, it needs more independence. We've just had the situation where antibiotic use has been approved for our waterways to treat the diseased salmon outbreaks in our waterways and the EPA will have to monitor that and is going to have to be doing additional work in relation to that. We have dolphins getting tied up in nets, getting caught in seal nets. It is clear that we need more action when it comes to not only the environment, but action on climate change. 

When it comes to Housing, this budget bakes in failure. The targets just get worse. In May, when the prorogued budget was handed down, we had a wait list on the priority housing list of 5094 people. Now, it's 5336 - an absolute record - and applicants are waiting longer. Need is outstripping provision, and that is a political choice. We have to understand that. 

Homes Tasmania has been reviewed. It's clear that it needs to be restructured. It is a structure that we Greens didn't support in 2022 and it's really clear that it needs additional work. The government made a commitment for 10,000 new and social affordable homes by 2032, but we see it consistently fudging the figures in terms of making up the numbers. Of course, there are things we can do in the housing space that don't even cost money. We can rein in short-stay accommodation, which would earn money. The five per cent levy has been kicked into the long grass until next year.

We can establish rent controls. We can end unfair evictions. We can make sure that there's minimum standards so that people save money and live in appropriate housing. We can make sure that there are other modification opportunities for tenants so that they can modify their house for disability, safety, security and other reasons. 

In Education, Cassy O'Connor now has the Education portfolio for the Greens, and we welcome a recent schooling resource standard announcement earlier in the year, but note that the four per cent loophole remains. It means that the Teachers Registration Board, depreciation, and other things, come out of that funding. It's not good enough. Wage growth is stagnant, and we need to recruit and retrain more professionals, because we've seen those wait lists for specialist services in schools get longer and longer. 

In the Energy space, we saw the government make massive decisions, humongous decisions around Marinus Link in the wake of the election campaign without proper reference to the caretaker period and without acknowledgement of the massive red flags that were in the business case. We have capital investments into TasNetworks for the North West Transmission Developments. We have huge costs predicted for major industrials, for households and others, to be offset by the mega profits to be earned by the Hydro - and what happened to the Hydro's profits this year? They've completely collapsed, because of the drying conditions, because of poor flows into the dams. We still haven't got Hydro acknowledging what they've done, or indeed releasing the river flow modelling that underpins their profit calculations going forward. The whole investments around energy are largely smoke and mirrors, and will ultimately assist big corporations into multinational corporations, and it's going to cost energy users here in Tasmania. 

When it comes to veterans, we know that the RSL has learned not to lean too hard on the Tasmanian Budget. They have only small, project-based funding, and they have been comprehensively shafted when it comes to their interests on the cenotaph and the stadium. Despite a strong campaign from the RSL, despite the fact that they don't want the stadium, they have been utterly ignored. 

When it comes to the arts, as always, it's utterly underwhelming. There are bits and pieces for TMAG, there's bits and pieces for the Theatre Royal. Yet, again, when it comes to the stadium, there is no problem finding $4 million-plus dollars for the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra for compensation and upgrades. Meanwhile, Blue Cow Theatre, Wide Angle Tas and other entities go out of business. 

This is not a budget for the everyday Tasmanian; it is a budget that is warped in its priorities. 

Time expired. 

[2.54 p.m.]
Mr MITCHELL (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable Deputy Leader of the Greens, or as I believe he's known in some circles, the 'Vicar of Dribbly', for his contribution to the House. The cognitive dissonance from those on the crossbench is absolutely unbelievable. The fact is, this Budget that is being handed down this week by this government is only made possible by the members of the crossbench and the members of the Greens backing in the Liberals - so own this budget. It's a budget you have helped put through because of your support for the government. 

Dr WOODRUFF - Honourable Speaker. 

The SPEAKER - I would ask the honourable member to - 

Dr WOODRUFF - It took a while for that comment to sink in. I find that member's language offensive to the standards in this Chamber - to refer to another member, whoever, like that. You know what you said. I think that's offensive and unbecoming behaviour for - 

Mr MITCHELL - I withdraw. 

Honourable Speaker, it's not the only example of cognitive dissonance in this place. Listening to the Premier and his senior ministers yesterday, you really do wonder whether they share the same planet as the rest of us. I know it's unusual these days to even acknowledge a shared set of facts upon which to build alternative ideas, but if we can't all at least agree that Tasmania's finances are more cooked than a burned snag at Bunnings, I'm not sure there's hope for the place.

Anyone listening to, and watching the Premier's performative contribution yesterday would think Tasmania is enjoying unending economic sunshine. It was like one of those tele-evangelical events, all 'rah rah' and cheering. Never mind that the government's own Budget papers show debt repayments for this year will be $750 million, and in four years time will be more than $1 billion. That's $1 billion in repayments, not $1 billion in debt. The projected debt is stratospheric; $10 billion plus the debt attached to government businesses and other liabilities. That's 1000 million dollars a year to be dug from the pockets of Tasmanians and handed over to the banks, not just once, but every year.

To the Premier, that's nothing to worry about. He's living in a fact-free zone - it's groovy baby. It's so square to care, just chill. It's all about the performance with this bloke. He's won a few elections now by keeping the crowd entertained with circus tricks. It's worked, so he keeps doing it. The July election was a case in point. Get some jackets made-up, rent an empty shopfront, put up a sign saying TasInsure and simply say you're going to create a state-owned insurer that will reduce insurance premiums and drop grocery prices. That's it; no business case, no evidence. Just say it, and the punters will buy it; and they did, because despite the evidence to the contrary, when a Tasmanian Premier says something, they're given the benefit of the doubt. They're the Premier, after all, the leader of the state. Massaging a message is one thing, but a blatant untruth? Surely not.

Yet four months after the election, there's no TasInsure, despite it being central to the Liberal campaign, with the jackets and slogans and promises rolled out at every interview. It was an illusion, a distraction. 'Look over there, be mesmerised, and you'll forget about the Spirits, the debt, the cuts, the scandals!'

This Liberal government has gone from zero net debt to $10 billion debt in a decade. It's been the fastest deterioration of this state's finances by any Tasmanian government ever. Financial incompetence on a scale never seen before by the party of the so-called better economic managers. This Premier simply shrugs his shoulders and smiles for a selfie on social media. He's the Pontius Pilate of the parliament, washing his hands of any responsibility for any issue. It's always someone else's responsibility, someone else's fault. The way he's constantly surprised when told there's a problem, you wouldn't know he's been Premier or a senior minister every single day of the 11 long years of this failed, worn-out government.

$10 billion is a big number. It's 10-thousand million dollars. Just imagine what a pile of $1 million looks like, and then put another 9999 identical piles in a row. That's $10 billion. That's how much money our state's on track to be in debt for under this Liberal government, when 11 years ago they inherited a net debt with not even one $1 coin in it. It's been an extraordinary turnaround under the Liberals, who so often claim to be the better economic managers.

What has this $10 billion in debt paid for? Has it gone towards a long-term investment in economic growth, or education outcomes, or better health? Has it contributed to Tasmania leading the nation on any index of wellbeing? No. On nearly every measure, after a decade of Liberal government, Tasmania is at the back of the pack for education outcomes, for health outcomes, for rental affordability and access. Tasmanian house prices have shot up, but not Tasmanian wages to pay for them. The Liberals oft-repeated claim that they're on track to build 10,000 homes is a sick joke. It's harder than ever for Tasmanians to make ends meet, and as a result of this interim budget - a warm up act for the main event monster budget headed our way in May - it's only going to get harder. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow treasurer have outlined in excruciating detail the ongoing incompetence around TT-Line and the Spirits fiasco, which continues to unravel, but what I find frankly startling is the Premier's cavalier dismissal of the findings of the Auditor-General.

The Auditor-General has found that there's a case that TT-Line was insolvent on 19 August 2025. This was after the government had bailed the company out with the $75 million lifeline. The Premier blithely tells the House, supported by the Treasurer, that TT-Line was not insolvent. White hands, case closed, nothing to see, move on. Except, this is the Auditor-General we are talking about, not some random bloke on Facebook expressing a view. When the Auditor General says you are insolvent, you have every right to disagree, as the TT-Line board does, but you had better present the evidence to show how and why he is wrong. It is not good enough for the Premier to come into this House and say there's alternative third-party advice, that the TT-Line board is well credentialed and, at the end of the day, the government would never let TT-Line not pay its bills. That is not good enough. If you believe the Auditor-General is wrong, prove it. Crunching numbers and determining solvency is the Auditor-General's job. It's what he does every hour of the day. If you think you know better, show how and why.

It is inconceivable to me the state Premier would so cavalierly dismiss the findings of an Auditor-General as just an opinion. The arrogance is breathtaking, as is the assumption that Tasmanians should simply take this Premier at his word when he has demonstrated again and again that his word means nothing. There is not a person in this parliament whose assurances are worth less than the Premier's. This is a Premier who wrote letters and signed them as premier of this state, promising to do one thing, only to do the exact opposite weeks later when it was in his political interest to do so. That should never be forgotten.

When it comes to my shadow portfolio, the Minister for Skills and Jobs yesterday said in his contribution to this debate that under this budget, no Tasmanian is left behind. As shadow minister for TAFE, training and Skills, my ears pricked up at that because it is so blatantly untrue. My office has been inundated with emails from students, graduates, teachers and employers about the minister's plans to axe subsidies to 12 TasTAFE courses. The minister's reasons have chopped and changed. He has claimed the cuts are due to poor enrolments, only to be presented with evidence of strong enrolments in many of the courses being cut. He has claimed the cuts are due to poor life outcomes of students enrolled in the courses, only to be presented with evidence of fulfilling careers and lives at the graduates of personally attributed to their TasTAFE courses. He has claimed the courses do not enjoy industry support, only to be presented with evidence of overwhelming support from employers for the quality of the courses and the skills they impart to students. He has claimed the cuts are necessary because the courses are not in line with his Skills plan, which itself is part of a national framework of TAFE priorities, only to be presented with evidence that other states, which are also part of the national framework, are maintaining the sorts of courses that he is cutting subsidies to.

The fact is, Speaker, these cuts are being made because this minister has a very narrow view of what TasTAFE should be and he does not see a future at TasTAFE for the arts, media, digital or laboratory tech. He says non-TAFE agencies can deliver training in those areas instead, despite evidence presented to this House that some of those training organisations do not even have a physical footprint in this state. Instead of expanding horizons for young Tasmanians, this minister and this government are narrowing those horizons. Instead of offering young Tasmanians reasons to stay in Tasmania, he is forcing them to move. Instead of offering more opportunity for international students, he is sending their business to the mainland.

The cuts to core subsidies are emblematic of this government's wider failures in skills and training in Tasmania. In the TasTAFE annual report, we see there are 949 fewer students at TasTAFE over the 12 months from 2024-25 and 447 fewer apprentices and trainees. Since 2022, the number of apprentice enrolments at TasTAFE has plummeted from 8693 to 6895. This all paints a picture of a skills and training sector under sustained pressure under this government, with young Tasmanians paying the price for 11 years of Liberal economic mismanagement.

We saw what happened federally when the Abbott, Turnbull, and Morrison coalition governments ripped more than $6 billion out of TAFE nationally and traineeships over their decade in power. Australia suffered a devastating skills crisis, contributing to chronic construction and housing labour shortages, which pushed up the cost of building homes. Since 2022, the Albanese Labor government has been working hard to repair the Liberal damage, with more than 600,000 Australians, including many Tasmanians, now enrolled nationally in free TAFE courses in areas of critical skills shortage.

The lesson is clear. Liberal governments simply fail to grasp the value that TAFE offers, cutting courses, narrowing scope and leaving training to the private sector, and it's always Labor governments that have to pick up the pieces and repair the damage. It's being done nationally and it's increasingly clear it would also have to be done in Tasmania. 

It gives me no pleasure to talk about the failures of this Budget. We're just four months into this government and it's already cooked. This Budget is an absolute failure, with economic heartlessness at the heart of it. We know worse is coming next May, but as we've seen in health, education and skills - in fact, right across the board - this Budget fails Tasmanians, fails young Tasmanians, and particularly fails regional Tasmanians across my electorate of Lyons.

Members - Hear, hear.

[3.07 p.m.]
Prof RAZAY (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise for my first contribution to the 2025-26 interim state Budget. I would like to take this opportunity to reflect what a budget is, because it's more than a collection of numbers. It's a reflection of our shared values, our shared priorities and our shared goals. We must look beyond the numbers because at the end of the day, a budget is about people, the people of our electorates who live, work and contribute to our community. The fact is that every Tasmanian has a stake in how the Budget is carved up and their future - our state's future - will be grounded in the decisions of today. I would like also to congratulate the honourable Treasurer for his first budget and serious attempt to tackle the growing Tasmanian budget deficit. 

In my first speech in parliament, I raised my concern about the growing government net debt, which is currently estimated at about $5 billion and projected to more than double in 2029. This rate of debt is unsustainable and we need to move to a fiscal balance surplus in order to reduce debt. We need to be more fiscally conservative in the short term, and that involves reducing our debt by reducing excessive spending, especially in infrastructure, including the Macquarie Point stadium.

The honourable Treasurer seems to have avoided taking the hard decisions and left them perhaps to later years and chose softer options such as cutting public service jobs. This was the best opportunity to make fundamental reforms to fix our state finances and administer budget repair, including reducing spending and paying off mountains of debt, which have been put off in order to perhaps build the Macquarie Point stadium - a stadium which might have an impact on spending on education, health, housing and public safety.

The forward Estimates of net operating expenses in the interim Budget is forecast to decline by 2.2 per cent over the next three years, predominantly through cuts in health and education spending. It's also estimated that the net operating balance will be a deficit of $1 billion in 2025-26, improving to a surplus of $5.6 million in 2028-29. However, this perhaps is an over-optimistic forward Estimate and it's probably most likely that the future total operating balance will exceed the forward Estimate, as it was in the 2024-25 budget with a net operating balance deficit of $1205 million, which was a deterioration of $412.5 million from the original deficit of $792.8 million in the 2024-25 budget.

Yes, there has been significant growth in the number of people employed in the state public sector which represents a significant component of government expenditure. The State Service grew by 4.5 per cent in 2023-24 and 3.3 per cent in the last financial year, while population growth was only 0.2 per cent, which may indicate overstaffing in non-essential services rather than an increased capacity to deliver services.

With employee costs representing about 46 per cent in the 2024-25 budget of total operating expenditure, it might be seen as natural to wield the axe at public service jobs. The government is pushing to cut 2800 public sector jobs by 2032 and while efficiency must be made for non-essential roles, we must protect our frontline workforce such as our nurses, our police officers and our teachers.

The highlight of the Treasurer's speech for me was when he revealed that workers compensation costs are rising dramatically, driven by increased claims and psychological injury prevalence. The Australian Education Union Tasmanian branch recently reported a 26 per cent increase in workers compensation between 2023 and 2025, with a 60 per cent increase in claims relating to psychological injury, so why isn't the Budget addressing workplace culture and promoting healthy work environments and drive efficiency that way?

Overwork, burnout, bullying, stress and anxiety - these are the factors we should be addressing. The public sector is more than a numbers game. We should acknowledge that health is the foundation of a thriving society which determines how productive and vibrant our economy is.

The number of Tasmanians employed has grown strongly in recent years, with an estimated 286,200 people employed in September 2025, while the unemployment rate at 4 per cent was the lowest in Australia. In addition, the number of job vacancies has more than doubled over the last four years, with labour force participation at 61.5 per cent.

In addition, the Tasmanian population is growing well below the long-term average and last year grew by only 0.2 per cent. Moreover, Tasmania has an older population with a high proportion of people over the age of 55 years and a lower proportion of people aged between 20 and 44. Although there was a decrease in the number of people aged 20 to 24 years, there was an increase in the age group 25 to 39 years, largely due to strong overseas migrations since 2021.

With the increased number of job vacancies and low unemployment rate, we have to be more creative in attracting people to the workforce. This includes promoting skilled worker migration and making it more attractive for older groups to re-enter the workforce by offering more flexibility, less bureaucracy and regulation and lower taxes.

Housing is one of the biggest issues our state is facing. The median price of houses sold in Tasmania was $330,000 in 2016 and the income required to repay a mortgage was only 23.2 per cent, but house prices rose dramatically to a median 623,000 in 2022 and the proportion of income required to repay a mortgage rose to 42.5 per cent. Since 2022, however, house prices in Tasmania have remained stable. History suggests that house prices in Tasmania will start to rise again, following the recent introduction of the $30,000 First Home Owner grant. There will be few first-time home buyers who can afford to own or build a house. The main beneficiaries are said to be investors in the housing market.

In the rental market, the proportion of income required to pay rent in Tasmania increased to 28-30 per cent between 2020 and 2022, although this has fallen to 26.5 per cent in 2025. Unfortunately, housing affordability will continue to deteriorate with massive shortages of social and affordable houses, forcing many Tasmanians out of the housing market. This will further exacerbate the rising number of people experiencing homelessness and the growing food insecurity ,which is now affecting nearly half of Tasmania.

According to Anglicare's recent report, it showed that there was a 34 per cent increase in Tasmanians seeking support through its housing support service, Housing Connect Front Door. Shockingly, it revealed an 88 per cent increase in the number of Tasmanians sleeping rough and 54 per cent increase in people living in inadequate conditions - living without running water or bathrooms or kitchens. Yes, it is hard to believe that some families in Tasmania are living in places without access to running water.

According to Anglicare, there are currently 5300 people on the waiting list for social and affordable housing and, without intervention, the number could soar to 14,000 by 2032. The harsh reality is that some people are on the waiting list for many years. Behind these statistics, there are mums and dads, sons and daughters, grandmothers and grandfathers who have been caught up in our worsening cost-of-living crisis and forced into cars, campervans, tents, friends' spare rooms, shelters, or the streets.

The government and Homes Tasmania has pledged to deliver 10,000 new social affordable homes by 2032, but will this happen and what do our homeless do in the meantime? With demand continuing to outstrip supply, we need to address housing access as a matter of urgency. The Tenants' Union of Tasmania revealed in 2022 that there are thousands of homes sitting empty across the state, based on water and the consumption data. These are not Airbnb or shacks, so instead of waiting for homes to be built, how can we encourage the owners of empty properties to open their doors? What budget measure can we introduce to unlock existing housing?

Inflation, as measured by Consumer Price Index, rose sharply between 2021 and 2022, from an average 2.5-3 to around 8 per cent. Since then, there has been steady decline in inflation rate, partly due to federal government energy subsidies and state government electricity rebates. However, there was only a moderate increase in wages, much lower than inflation, which has led to a decline in real wages; although, the fall in inflation in the last two years has seen real wages start to rise again.

Unfortunately, over the last 20 years, with successive federal and state governments giving regular grants to stimulate housing market, there has been a massive increase in house prices without a significant increase in real wages. In 2021, for example, house prices increased by 21 per cent, while wages increased by 2.2 per cent, leading to worsening housing affordability and many families having difficulty in making ends meet.

At the moment we have young people locked out of the housing market. At the other end of the scale, pensioners are being penalised for downsizing, further strangling our housing supply. In fact, according to reports by Cotality, 61 per cent of Australian households are made up of just one or two people, but 76 per cent of Australian homes have three, four or more bedrooms. We need budget reform that makes it easier for older Australian to downsize and stay connected to their family and community, freeing up homes for families.

Education accounts for the second highest budget expenditure, at $2.4 billion or 23 per cent of the total expenditure. There has been a lot of investment in school infrastructure and education system over the years. Despite this, education standards have declined over the last 15 years. Tasmanian teachers are experiencing increased workloads, leading to less time to connect with the students. Given the rising mental health crisis for Australian youth, teachers and students' wellbeing should be our top priority to encourage connections, safety in relationships and positive interactions.

Teachers are feeling overworked and under appreciated, despite having one of the most important and impactful jobs, supporting and educating Tasmania's future workforce and decision-makers. We should continue to support and listen to our teachers and make sure that they have all the resources they need, including better pay and less administration tasks to ensure our children and youth receive the best education. Let's work with teachers and school staff to contribute to a hopeful and positive future for Tasmanians.

As a health professional, I acknowledge the government's $3.5 billion commitment to the state's health system this financial year, which remains one of the highest expenditures, accounting for 34 per cent of the budget. This has more than doubled over the last 10 years, reflecting a growing demand and increased healthcare costs, such as increased admissions to emergency departments, increased hospital admissions and attendance to specialist clinics, and increased employee-related costs, supplies and consumables. Moreover, over the next five years, Tasmania might face a $675 million shortfall in its budget. Despite massive increases in hospital funding, emergency departments are still facing continuous [inaudible]. There are shortages of hospital beds, despite the increasing number of beds. 

Tasmanian hospitals are still experiencing the growing problem of aged-care bed-block, where hospital beds are being occupied by elderly patients who are medically fit to be discharged. Recent figures suggest an average of 100 elderly Tasmanians, which is equivalent to three wards, are waiting to be discharged; but they are stuck in hospitals waiting for weeks, even months for aged-care facilities, costing the health system millions of dollars annually in wasted hospital resources.

This is not just a Tasmanian government problem. States and territories around Australia are all facing the same problem. Last month, health ministers at the Council for the Australian Federation met and issued an urgent call to the federal government to increase its contribution to health funding to the 45 per cent level that was agreed in the 2023 National Health Reform Agreement. We need bipartisan unity between all members of the House, as well as other states and territories, and with the federal government, to work together in partnership so we all take responsibility for putting solutions in place.

We have also to recognise that many elderly people prefer to live at home. Early discharge planning and working with community providers alongside hospital teams to provide appropriate discharge packages will help to enable early discharge from hospital.

Meanwhile, Tasmania has one of the highest rates of chronic health problems and the worst cardiovascular risk factors, which contributes to increased demand on hospital services. Investment in health prevention will help greatly in reducing health disorders and admissions to the Emergency Department, and freeing more beds in hospitals.

As I read the Budget, I learned that the success of a modern economy is measured by revenue, expenditure, debt, inflation, growth, investment and employment. There is no measurement of how the economy is fairer, more humane, inclusive and protective of our society and environment. We need a stronger emphasis on wellbeing, rather than just financial transactions. 

[3.26 p.m.]
Mr JAENSCH (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I congratulate the Treasurer, the Premier and ministers for the work that they've done to bring this interim budget together in a very short time frame. They've done so in the immediate aftermath of an election brought on by others in the name of budget repair, but also against the backdrop of a strong and stable state economy, record low unemployment and nation-leading business and investment conditions.

Our mission must be to return the budget to balance at a rate, and in ways, that do not disrupt the investment confidence and economic momentum that has been built over the last decade, and which will underpin future growth and state revenues. As other speakers have noted, this is an interim budget, dealing with the balance of the 2025-26 financial year, following the first interim budget, which covers a period ending in December. Work on the substantive full-year 2026-27 Budget has commenced. This will be where a broader range of initiatives and strategies will be laid out in terms of both management of the state's finances and delivery of the government's agenda.

The interim Budget allocations before us now therefore should contain no surprises on either front. No bold new spending initiatives, no dramatic savings measures. To do either would be irresponsible in a mid-year interim budget without the benefit of the consultation and analysis that is currently underway.

However, the Budget documents do lay out a new roadmap for savings and a return to surplus which some will say is too ambitious or unachievable and others will say is not aggressive enough. Either way, it's based on an acceptance of the need for deliberate and sustained corrective action to ensure the sustainability of the state's finances. I would hope that this is a shared view.

If we all share the view that budget control is essential, we also need to call out and move past the political mischief of labelling every fixed-term project that finishes as being a 'cut' and every vacancy that's not filled as a 'sacking'. Taken to its illogical conclusion, this thinking means that, for example, a future Labor government would treat every project funding allocation and public service position as permanent and recurrent. Under Labor, government spending on everything could only grow forever. Funding would never stop for anything.

Furthermore, Labor can't go on spreading fear about the state's financial position and every measure proposed to improve it. Yesterday, Mr Willie and Mr Winter had the opportunity to offer bilateral support for budget reform initiatives that address the issues they said were important enough to boycott the original 2025-26 Budget and ultimately force the state to an election. Their Budget reply speeches yesterday were an ideal opportunity for them to either commit to supporting difficult decisions through the coming budget process or to propose their own. Sadly, they did neither. All of this whilst Labor continues to boycott the Treasurer's multi-party budget consultation panel process and, at the same time, demand acceptance of unions opening wage claims for the majority of the public service workforce. Lazy and cheap, but sadly predictable politics from Labor. Shame on them.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The only one who should be speaking right now is the honourable member for Braddon, and I remind the honourable member for Braddon that if you refer to another member in this House, you call them honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable member for Franklin, Mr Winter.

Mr JAENSCH - I will do that from now on, thank you, honourable Speaker. On this side, we are up to the challenge, and we are listening - to the crossbench, the public service, the unions, industry and community bodies on their needs and solutions to these challenges. We will work with those ready to work with us to serve the best interests of Tasmanians, and I commend the Treasurer and the Premier for their leadership and their openness to collaboration on this complex challenge, because that's what the Tasmanian people expect us to do. After all, we are talking about their money and the services they rely on. 

I don't believe there's one taxpayer out there who doesn't think that there is waste and duplication in the delivery of government services, just as there is in every other sector, which is why the businesses and industries that drive our economy, the successful ones, are always constantly reviewing their operations and involving their employees, suppliers and customers in the constant drive to seek out and eliminate waste and cost. If they don't, they don't survive.

Tasmania is not a cheap place to do business compared to the rest of the world. Competitiveness is everything, on quality, certainly, but also cost. Ask anyone who works in our advanced manufacturing sector - their livelihoods depend on it and they expect the same of us. 

I don't think there's one public service employee out there who doesn't have good ideas about how to better use resources in their area of government operations, and we need to harness that. They're the experts at what they do, and they know what slows their work down or wastes their time: That's why the Treasurer has invited their input and he's getting it. 

I thank those who've contributed so far and look forward to their ideas contributing to the budget process over the next six months. I also look forward to these processes becoming part of the normal culture of good practice in government service delivery, which everyone involved can be proud of. 

I support the calls that have been made here this week in particular for the Australian Government to deliver on its commitments to pay its fair share of Health funding and Disability supports under previous and existing State Commonwealth agreements. This is a situation faced by all states and territories, but it affects Tasmania and the Tasmanian Budget proportionally more than the others, because of our size and our revenue mix. I look forward to bipartisan or tripartisan or pan-partisan support for this cause which, if addressed, will have disproportionate benefits for our future budgets. 

Turning to the Budget itself – while this is an interim budget and does not address the full range of investment and budget management initiatives that will be in next year's full-year budget, it does provide continuity of service delivery that are the core business of government and also initiatives already underway. I will briefly comment on a selection of budget items that I have had some history with myself and maintain a keen interest in, including some of those in my electorate of Braddon.

Importantly, for those who accuse the government of wrong priorities or 'cutting' essential services, compared to the 2024-25 Budget, the current interim budget shows: 

		Investment in Health has increased by 12 per cent to $14.5 billion; 
		
		Education has increased by 5 per cent to $9.9 billion; and 
		
		Public order and safety has increased by 9 per cent to $3.9 billion.

Spending on these essential services grows in this budget, it is not being cut. In my former portfolio of Children and Youth, $750 million is provided over four years, including additional funding of $15 million over two years to support continued delivery of out-of-home care, building on the $120 million over four years in the 2024-2025 budget to increase the base funding for out-of-home care as required under commission of inquiry recommendation 9.1. 

For the Bringing Baby Home program there is $10.32 million over four years, $8 million over two years for the Intensive Family Engagement Service, which we spoke about earlier today, and $6.22 million over four years for transition to independence for young people exiting out-of-home care and transitioning into adulthood and life on their own. As we reflected on earlier, this is an initiative of this government on our watch, reflecting that young people in out-of-home care, like all young people, develop the skills to live independently at different rates, developmentally and in terms of their readiness to be out in the world fending for themselves. We continue to support our own children through our households as they make that transition and this should be no different for young people in out-of-home care. The transition to independence model provides continuing support tailored to the needs of the individual young person exiting out-of-home care and the people who provide that care for them to ensure that the transition is successful for them and happens at their pace.

There is also an immediate uplift of over $2 million to support foster and kinship carers while a longer-term review of supports for them is underway. We appreciate the incredible work done by our foster and kinship carers right across the state and the difference it makes to the lives of often the very many young people they help to raise and bring to adulthood and independence.

The Budget includes whole-of-government funding to deliver commission of inquiry recommendations, which is increased from $424.5 million over the forward Estimates to now $600 million. Funding is also allocated for the operations of the independent monitor who overseas actions delivering on the commission of inquiry's recommendations, and there's also a further $600 million set aside to compensate victim/survivors of child sexual abuse in government institutions. There's funding for the establishment of the new Commission for Children and Young People and implementation of the Weiss review as well.

In the area of Youth Justice, I'm pleased to see a total now of $155.3 million allocated for delivery of the new youth justice facility in the south of the state, which is currently moving through the council approvals process, and continuing investment in diversion and improved bail options for young people to reduce the number of young people in detention, especially those detained prior to sentencing. This investment includes $3.7 million over three years for expansion of the JCP Youth BEAST program and $2.3 million over three years to support innovative local initiatives and partnerships to address the causes of offending at local scale.

In the Education portfolio, there's a record investment of more than $2 billion in the 2025-26 financial year alone and $8.9 billion across the forward Estimates. Included in that, we're investing over $294 million over the next four years in education facilities, creating the environments within which our young people can learn to their best advantage, including major upgrades for 24 schools across the state. There is our $10 million playground and sports courts upgrade program, with 103 sites around the state going to benefit from that; a teacher residence upgrade program to help ensure we continue to attract and retain teachers by offering competitive living conditions for them, particularly in remote areas; development of our three newest Child and Family Learning Centres, along with a permanent child and family learning service across the Huon Valley; and over $20 million towards our VET facilities fund.

We're also seeing operational investment in this Budget in the Education portfolio over the next four years, including $10 million of funding in 2025-26 for the Educational Adjustments Disability Funding model, $6.5 million for the Variety School Breakfast Program, $125,000 for the continuation of the Libraries Tasmania 2610 communities program, and $4 million to continue our Healthy School Lunch Program.

Our Budget also considers the independent review of education in Tasmania and its recommendations, including backing our schools to continue on the Lifting Literacy strategy journey by providing a $12 million in the 2025 school year to supercharge literacy resources to support teachers and students to ensure they are helping to close that gap with the national average when it comes to the literacy of our young people. 

Every dollar we invest and every young person we assist earlier to master their literacy means that they get more out of every subsequent year of learning beyond that. Once they get behind it's very difficult to get them back, as you well know, honourable Speaker. We're very proud of those initiatives and it's fantastic to see that there's been commitments to continue them in this interim Budget.

In the Health portfolio, where I held responsibilities for a time in mental health and wellbeing, some of the projects I am glad to see supported through the Budget include the St John's Park health and wellbeing precinct work, including a 40-bed older person's mental health facility, a 12-bed child and adolescent mental health inpatient unit and day facility and a 15-bed adult mental health centre, which will also provide a safe haven integration hub and co-located eating disorders treatment centre. Funding will provide for the establishment of a new intensive residential parenting unit at St John's Park to support mothers experiencing postnatal challenges, including support for their mental and physical health needs. 

In the north, there's funding across the forward Estimates towards our 10-year Launceston General Hospital Master Plan, and in the north-west, funding towards the first stage of the North West Regional Hospital Master Plan, including a new mental health precinct and upgrade to expand the emergency department. Funding is also provided for the Devonport Mental Health Hub over two years. This facility will offer a safe haven recovery college and integration hub as well.

In the community sector, a range of supports have been maintained or increased, including the Energy Hardship Fund, which has been increased to $450,000 per annum over four years. In the food security and food relief area, we have committed $7.1 million over four years on top of the $6 million provided under our 2030 Strong Plan to provide for food relief providers and $14.6 million to double the Healthy School Lunch program to 60 schools across the state.

Neighbourhood House funding has increased by $40 million to the network since 2021 and under our Strong Plan this has included additional funding of $1.7 million to the 34 houses as well as $6 million for new capital funding and expansion of the Community Connector program, which will continue. 

One of the initiatives I'm particularly pleased to see has been supported in this Budget is the making good on our commitment to make Working With Vulnerable People cards and checks free for volunteers in Tasmanian organisations. Volunteers, as we know, are the lifeblood and the fabric of of many communities and services for people in need. People are giving generously of their own time, skills and resources. 

We know that acquiring the cost of Working With Vulnerable People cards every four to five years as they're required is not a huge amount in itself, but it is a significant cost in the weekly household budget for those who volunteer, many of whom are on fixed and low incomes themselves. More to the point, when we announced this initiative, it's greatest significance was from those volunteers recognising the value of their contribution and the gesture of saying, this is something we require of you in order for you to be able to fulfil these roles. It's only fair that we cover the cost of that for you. It's not a gift to them; it's a way of acknowledging that they already give us more than we could ever pay for in service to their community. The recognition of that has been very well welcomed, and I'm very glad to see the Treasurer and the minister have been able to accommodate that commitment in this interim budget.

This is an interim budget, the second tabled this year. I commend the Treasurer, our ministers, their officers and their departments for all the work involved in bringing it together. The work now starts in earnest, though, with us delivering on the budget. That includes the obligation to be managing towards budget repair and a return to balance, which everyone in this place spoke to their constituents about and heard about during the election and has given commitments to work together to deliver.

I hope in the spirit of delivering that in a cooperative parliament that we can deliver not only a continuity of Tasmania's current economic success, our low unemployment rates, but also a pathway to a balanced budget and a sustainable future.

Time expired.

[3.47 p.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to provide some insights into the 2055-26 interim Budget. It's hard to know exactly where to start with this. You could almost liken it to a smorgasbord of issues. Which ones should we focus on as members first, which ones will be most pertinent to our individual communities and our portfolio areas? Boy, there are a lot of issues. I suppose that's a nice way to put it. 

I will kick off by talking about the false rationale that we keep hearing from a lot of the government members, talking about this pathway to surplus. I'm reminded it was only six months ago that this government wouldn't even admit that they even had a budget problem, that there was a debt and deficit issue. Now there is at least an admittance that our finances of our beautiful state are in complete disarray. You are talking about this pathway to surplus, and there is absolutely no path at all, no plan at all - which Ms Greene, in her very good budget response this morning, referred to. There is no plan. 

There is no pathway to a surplus and especially within this 2025-26 Interim Budget, because this is just the support act to the main event. The main event is really kicking off in May 2026 - I think that's when some horrendous cuts are going to be made. I believe there's an understanding that that is on the way. What we do know is that will most probably mean cuts to services and cuts to public service jobs. That's pretty clear that that is what's going to happen.

What I'm finding really interesting is, I don't know whether or not a lot of people just have poor memories or there's just so much public relations and marketing and spin that comes out of the government machine at the moment, people just forget. I looked at the newspaper the other day and there was an advertisement that the government are putting out for public consultation changes to the Tasman Bridge, new safety ideas for the Tasman Bridge. They were putting it out to community consultation. I looked it up and I remember the Honourable Speaker was actually part of the Public Works Committee with me when we looked at the Tasman Bridge three years ago. The stuff that your government is now putting out as new for community consultation was already done four years ago when there was $65 million allocated from the federal government to upgrade the Tasman Bridge.

Now, 10 years ago, the coroner put out a report and, in their findings found, after someone had actually gone off the bridge, that safety guardrails, anti-jump rails, needed to be put on the Tasman Bridge. That was 10 years ago. We sat as a Public Works Committee three years ago and signed this off. All that consultation already happened. Now, in the last few weeks, this government has put out little media releases and called for public consultation on these safety guardrails on the Tasman Bridge. This all happened years and years ago, but this is how it all operates. It's the perception of trying to be efficient or the perception of trying to do something when all of this actually should've happened 10 years ago. It was signed off on three years ago, and now they're saying, 'Oh, aren't we going to be heroes because we're going to finally put up the safety guardrails on the Tasman Bridge.' 

How many people have jumped from that bridge in that 10 years since the coroner put that out as a request? Really, it is not good enough. That is something that really should have been looked at. For them to say, 'Oh, look, aren't we doing the right thing - we're going to put out this public consultation on this bridge now.' Really, that was all three years ago, at least. That was when we signed that off at the Public Works Committee, so what happened? What happened?

Another thing they can't keep talking about is what a great financial state Tasmania is in at the moment. Saul Eslake has stated that Tasmania's projected non-financial public sector cash deficits will be larger as a percentage of gross state product than those of any other state or territory. We are in a really bad financial position, Deputy Speaker. We can't just keep glossing it over and we can't just think, 'Oh, Labor is being negative.' Enough. It is just nonsense.

I don't think the public will realise until they call an ambulance and it doesn't come, like what happened in Mole Creek on Sunday. The public won't understand how this is going to affect them until they turn up at a hospital and there's simply no way they're going to be seen in emergency because it's not staffed well enough. Or the public call a police officer and a police officer can't attend because their numbers have been potentially cut, or they try to get special learning for one of their children that might have autism or a learning difficulty. 'Oh, sorry, we don't have those people there anymore in place.' The public don't quite understand yet just what that May budget next year will be, and they're already starting to feel it now. The Mole Creek ambulance not being able to attend - I found out - I spoke about it this morning - but it was actually four to five hours that they were waiting for that ambulance. Then when the ambulance people rang them, they said, 'We're so sorry, we can't send an ambulance. We just don't have an ambulance to pick someone up with two broken arms, two wrists, broken teeth, in shock and with concussion. I'm sorry, we just can't send anyone.' That happened on Sunday here in Tasmania, under this government's watch. It's not okay. 

Another thing which I'm finding really perplexing is the government keep putting out a heap of legislation, especially in the police portfolio, which is the portfolio I look after. I have so much time for the work that Tasmania Police do. They are, by far, the best police service in Australia. Do you know they're the only police service in Australia that have all their recruits undertake tertiary qualifications? Just about every single graduate that comes out of the Tasmania Police Academy has a degree in human services. We're the only state in Australia that has that. That is why the confidence our public has in the police is so high. It's one of the reasons why - they are so well trained. I spent some time at the police academy, I think it was last week, and I was so pleased because they actually let me go through one of their training - 

Unknown - Module? 

Ms BUTLER - Yes, it was like a module, but they had an actor as part of it. They had recruits, the trainees, being put through reenactments of real-life situations, because at the moment, they're looking at least two family violence incidents a day that they will be responding to. They can be some of the most stressful and, I suppose, emotional events that police officers will attend. What I thought was amazing was how young some of these graduates were - because I am ageing and, as you get older, everyone looks a lot younger I suppose - but gee they were savvy and they really knew what they were doing. They were reenacting these situations; there was really loud music and lights flickering on and off. They had babies crying. It was like they were part of a scene in a film almost, and they were savvy, they were so good.

What I am concerned about, though, is that the police budget was cut by $35 million last year. That's a lot of money to cut out of DPFEM and, as far as I can see, there is nothing in this budget that even goes near addressing the wellbeing rosters. Those wellbeing rosters are the biggest thing that Tas Police asked for. Having a rostering system, when they're in the 24-hour stations, that provides them with an opportunity to have a work-life balance, was the main thing that they asked for. Yes, during the election Mr Ellis finally pledged to slowly introduce some wellbeing rosters, but there was no money put to it. There is no money in this budget for it at all, which is really disrespectful. Noting, too, he only did it about two hours after we released ours, which I know sounds like a conspiracy, but it is true to form.

That, to me, is a missed opportunity because the workers compensation levels for Tasmania Police are huge. We're looking at over 16 per cent now. That's a lot of police and they are not there because they have a sore thumb. These are police who are being really burnt out. They have to deal with some of the worst things that none of us would want to face head on a day-to-day basis, I'm sure, and they do it beautifully. The only way that they can do that, however, is if they can manage a work-life balance. Cutting off that funding stream for those wellbeing rosters - and these rosters were trialled, they were proceeding. The previous police minister supported them, there was funding going into them. Mr Shelton, I believe you were part of that push to create those wellbeing rosters as well. Just that understanding that something had to be done to assist police to bring that workers compensation level down because not only are we are we burning them out, but a lot of them are actually leaving the service and not coming back. We really need to watch that churn as well. That is a real missed opportunity and it's costing us so much money to support those police officers as well. Not only are we damaging some of our greatest assets in our community, but we are also having to pay a huge price for doing that as taxpayers as well, and that's not on.

I also want to talk about a problem we have. There is new legislation that is coming to the House in that policing area and we are providing police with greater powers. A good example is the metal detection wands. We're providing police with greater powers to search for weapons, dangerous weapons, as a deterrent for people carrying knives or dangerous weapons, but they were introduced and then, for four months, the wands were not ordered for police to be able to undertake and carry out. They weren't given the tools to conduct those searches and then we saw the consequence. Hypothetically speaking, the alleged incident could have happened at Salamanca anyway, but what those laws were about is deterrence, making people think twice about taking dangerous illegal weapons into those hotspot areas. Now, the minister said publicly that it was Labor's fault that those wands were not ordered because of the election- those ones would have cost $20,000-30,000. You do not need a Treasury tick-off for that. All you need is a discretionary grant, which any minister who was doing their job properly, especially after he had headlines and, you know, he's always making sure he gets a headline, always making sure he's on the front page of the paper with his 'tough on crime' mantra; but you can't just stand there for the PR then not order the wands. A discretionary grant is all it would have cost to arm police with the tools that are required. 

It's our understanding that he did the same thing with the tasers. On the front page: 'Tough on crime' - 'We’re going to give police tasers, they're going to start trials of tasers.' There's Mr Ellis on the front page of the Examiner, I think it was, or the Mercury. Again, today, on the front page of the paper. What I couldn't believe was that yesterday the people of Tasmania learnt that TT-Line is broke. This is a licence to print money. TT-Line is a licence to print money. We're an island state. We are so reliant on TT-Line for our freight, for our tourism, for our transport. They belong to the people of Tasmania, and they're broke, according to the Auditor-General. Oh, sorry, that's right; I don't have to take on the opinion of the Auditor-General. What would the Auditor-General know? It's the Auditor-General. Would you question anything the Solicitor-General said? No, you wouldn't. The Auditor-General says, 'I think there's some solvency issues.' Then, 'No, I'm just going to dismiss that.' It is just bizarre. Bizarrely, this news broke yesterday, but it wasn't on the front page of the paper. That was Mr Ellis being tough on crime with a packet of Marlboro cigarettes in front of him, saying he's going to clean up vaping and illegal cigarettes. What on earth is going on in Tasmania when a bankrupt TT-Line is not on the front page of a paper? I couldn't believe it. 

I understand that illegal cigarettes are a huge issue and I understand that vapes are a huge issue; but it's not another opportunity for Mr Ellis to have a 'tough on crime' front-page spread in the Mercury; like he did with tasers, which were never ordered and I can't see in this budget, and like he did with wands, which were never ordered and would have cost, what, $20,000-30,000? It's just pathetic. So, yes, I'm not very happy with the minister for Police, who hasn't allocated any money for tasers, as far as I can see. It's nuts.

I would like to talk quickly about what some of these cuts to our public servants are going to mean. It is my understanding that in order to cut a lot of these public servant positions, they can't afford the redundancies, because they're too skint, the government is too broke to afford redundancies. What they're looking at doing instead, is finding public servants whose contracts are finishing up, and they not replacing them. Redundancies are expensive; but ending contracts is different. This is where the online access centres have come to their end, because each one of those online access centres has a coordinator, who is paid a wage. That grant process was finishing up, those contracts are finishing up in the middle of next year, so that's why those amazing assets have been cut out.

I will read the response from the minister, Ms Palmer, to my letter on online access centres. It says:

I would like to reassure you that the Tasmanian government is committed to supporting digital inclusion services in Tasmanian communities. The OAC [online access centre] model was established in the late 1990s and centres have provided valuable services to Tasmanian communities since this time. The digital-inclusion landscape in Tasmania has significantly changed in the last 25 years, and opportunities to improve access and services continue to be a priority for the Tasmanian government. Many OACs have ceased to operate over the last two decades, overwhelmingly due to the difficulty of finding volunteers for management committees and front-of-house services. 

Recognising the challenges to the sustainability of these organisations, the government commissioned a review of digital-inclusion services in 2024. The subsequent digital-inclusion review report identifies significant issues with the current model, particularly relating to ensuring that OAC staff had the requisite skills and training to provide appropriate and contemporary digital inclusion support.

The independent review of digital inclusion in Tasmania, was conducted by Ms Kym Goodes of 3P Advisory, a widely respected consultant who has extensive experience in digital inclusion in Tasmanian communities. 

The review undertook widespread consultation with OACs and local councils. Whilst the review recommended the phasing out of OACs, the government does not support this approach. Instead, I extended the Digital Connections Grant program through to 30 June 2026 to allow for a more detailed discussion with individual OACs and to provide surety of employment for OAC coordinators over this period. 

Mr Patrick Gregory, executive director of Libraries Tasmania, subsequently visited all the OACs and associated councils. The aim of this process is to ensure sustainable digital inclusion services in each of these communities. There is no one-size-fits-all solution and proposed ways forward for each OAC beyond 30 June are currently ongoing. 

In recent years, Libraries Tasmania has significantly expanded its digital inclusion capabilities -

That's nonsense, by the way - 

- as well as offering free Wi-Fi and computers. It has trained staff to support drop-in enquiries, offers one-to-one digital skills sessions with staff and over 80 trained volunteers, as well as a range of programs with service providers such as Good Things Foundation. 

Libraries Tasmania is also very well connected with other local service providers enabled to provide appropriate referrals to literacy services, jobs hubs, and other community services where required. 

Of the 15 OACs, it is proposed that four of these merge with local library services where there is a clear duplication of services - New Norfolk, Devonport, Lilydale and St Helens. [TBC]

This is a disgrace. They are closing the OACs because they are too poor to pay for the coordinator's wages. It stinks.

[4.07 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak in response to the interim Budget and to reflect on it through the eyes of Tasmanians who are watching the government, looking to the Premier and his Cabinet to create the environment and circumstances they need to live well. Tasmanians are watching. I've been approached by many people since Thursday's Budget, all of them asking me what I think of it. I have to confess to describing the Budget and this government's approach with f-words; fantasy, fairytale, fanciful, and I'd go so far as to say fraudulent and false. There is no way Tasmania is looking at a surplus, even a miniscule surplus, by 2028-29. It's simply impossible, yet the Treasurer wants us to take his Budget at face value and believe him when he says it will all be okay soon.

I haven't been in this place for very long, but in my experience Tasmanian budgets are impenetrable, and deliberately so. Any real detail of government spending is buried in broad budget lines that provide no indication about exactly what is being funded where. We are left to pry open what may or may not be funded with a virtual crowbar, or do sums to track where the money has gone from one budget to the next. 

This Budget is no different. It's as opaque as ever. Even given that, it's not hard to tell a budget surplus is impossible. It's a fanciful fairytale, fudging the figures over forward Estimates to create the impression of a surplus where there will be none. You can't fund food relief and resilience for four years as an election promise and expect the problem to go away and take that line out of the Budget forever more. 

You can't put two years of extra funding into integrated family engagement services and then take it away to clear out that budget line when community service organisations haven't been able to keep up with the need for years. You can't give a temporary uplift to child safety services and tick that box and remove the line from the Budget after a couple of short years as if it's all fixed, when child safety services have been underfunded for literally decades. You can't give foster carers an uplift in their support for a year and think you've permanently fixed the problem of carers not receiving the reimbursement they need to care for children in a cost-of-living crisis. 

The Treasurer is dreaming, whipping spending out of forward Estimates to create a fantasy in an attempt to convince us, or maybe those in the other place, that everything is ultimately going to be fine, so go ahead and sign off on that gigantic stadium that's going to add $2 billion to the state's debt burden and mean payments of up to $70 million a year solely on interest that will accrue and accrue and accrue. It's all going to be fine, a surplus is coming, let's get on with our terrible decision-making. As well as dreaming of impossible surplus castles in the air, the Treasurer is doing a whole lot of blaming.

The Treasurer has a silver tongue. I've been listening to him and watching him since I came into this place. He has a gift for quick, witty lines and clever repartee. Sometimes he throws a smidgin of charm into the mix and maybe he provokes a little laugh, but it's a forked silver tongue the Treasurer has. He speaks words that seem to show interest in Tasmanians, but his very careful, deliberately chosen words reveal the truth of what he's thinking.

In his budget speech the Treasurer described the financial forces we are up against, and he said one of those forces is 'the ongoing cost of meeting community expectations for essential services'. He's talking about the cost of people's expectations, not the cost of essential services but the cost of Tasmanians' expectations that they get essential services, as if somehow their desire to have an ambulance available when they need it, or that they can get surgery within clinically recommended times, or that they can get food and support when they're hungry is somehow excessive and unnecessary and a terrible burden on the state. It's as if Tasmanians are being selfish and it's their selfishness that has thrown the state's finances into such disarray. 

I'm quite frankly appalled at such language. Tasmanians have every right to expect essential services to be there to catch them when they fall and to suggest otherwise is to blame Tasmanians for the state's financial position rather than taking responsibility for 11 years of budget mismanagement.

The Treasurer revealed what he thinks of older Tasmanians in the wording he chose to answer a question yesterday morning. Talking about the need for more federally funded aged care and disability beds in the state, he said that on 2 September there were 101 bed-blockers in our public hospital system and that 'that amounts to three wards with bed-blockers'. No-one is denying we need more facilities for older people and people living with disability, but 'bed-blockers' - seriously? 

The Treasurer is dehumanising and stigmatising vulnerable people who, through no fault of their own, are unable to be accommodated in homes or facilities that are better suited to their needs. The Treasurer is at it again, blaming Tasmanians for problems that are not of their making but are due to systems failure. Again, I'm appalled by the Treasurer's word choices and what they reflect about what he thinks of Tasmanians. It sends a chill through me. 

But wait, there's more. The Treasurer isn't done with his dumping on Tasmanians. He's also got it in for those Tasmanians who work in the public service. 'Does anybody want to downsize the public service?', the Treasurer asked yesterday in question time, before saying, 'Of course not, but when you know that 46 per cent, rounded up to 50 per cent, of the Budget is employed or used for public service wages' - the Treasurer laid it on in his budget speech - 'public sector wages contribute over 46 per cent of total operating expenditure, wages is the single largest operating cost of the general government sector.' There's the pejorative again - those pesky public servants working for all Tasmanians; they cost us so much. 

I've worked in service provision for much of my life, right back from my early days on the checkout in the local supermarket through to today, and the joke with colleagues was always that the supermarket would run so much more smoothly if we didn't have customers. Nursing would be so much easier if we didn't have patients. Here we have a treasurer who seems to think the public service would run better without public servants, or more cheaply, anyway. Is it any wonder we are all expecting deep cuts to public service jobs? There is a constant thread of devaluing and demeaning Tasmanians in the Treasurer's words, and it is deeply troubling. Our public servants do valuable, capable, much-needed work that we all benefit from.

I mentioned earlier that the Treasurer's words sent a chill through me and I'm not the only one getting a nasty shiver down my spine when I look at this Budget. I've been speaking with people in both the public sector and the community sector. There is deep worry about what next May's budget will hold for these sectors. Many are holding their breath. Right now, they are just hanging in there with the funding they currently receive. They cannot sustain an efficiency measure, a budget squeeze or a reduction in funding. Any cuts will mean cuts to services that Tasmanians are relying on. Many of those services are in health, where we certainly cannot afford any cuts at all. Reading through the performance information in the Department of Health 2024-2025 Annual Report, it's like searching for a needle in a haystack to find a performance measure that meets its target. Here are a couple of particularly egregious failures: 

Less than 50 per cent of Emergency Department patients were seen within the recommended triage time. The wait can be so long, patients give up and go home without being seen - something I've heard from patients directly. It's yet another measure the government has failed to meet its own target on.

In the area of mental health, the government try to tell us they are keeping up with demand, but their Department of Health report shows that less than 25 per cent of mental health patients are admitted through ED within eight hours of arrival. We've all heard the reports of people waiting up to 90 hours for admission to a mental health ward. It's not good enough. 

Over 10,000 people are waiting for dental appointments and more than 1200 are waiting for dentures. 

It's very clear that Tasmanians are already struggling to get the healthcare they need, and staff are working their hardest under incredibly difficult conditions. Rather than acknowledge the problems, the government prefers to boast that it is spending more on Health than ever before. Well, it would be a bit of a worry if they weren't. Costs go up every year, so of course Health spending must go up in parallel. It's perfectly normal and expected for Health funding to increase, and so it should. Inflation is everywhere and more so in Health, so it's not that special or particularly generous of the government to have put more into Health. It's simply what must be done, but it's certainly not meeting the level of need within our community. 

Cuts are not tenable, and yet that's exactly what the government plans - 2800 job cuts, 'efficiency measures'. Their Efficiency and Productivity Unit, aka DOGE, is up and running, searching out every dollar they can shave off the budget. They're crowing about 258 suggestions already coming in from public servants. Well, I spoke with a group of doctors last night who have been making real, effective suggestions for savings for months. Their suggestions have been ignored while Health Department managers have imposed decisions from above, but those decisions are costing the Department more. There are efficiencies that can be found within Health - staff do know that. However, the efficiencies won't work with a top-down approach that is not grounded in the knowledge of clinicians who see, every day, how the system works. 

People are doing it tough in our state. They can't afford essentials. Last week we heard, from Foodbank's Hunger Report, that close to a quarter of Tasmanians are skipping meals or going without food for whole days. More and more people are turning to neighbourhood houses for support and these houses are doing an amazing job of responding to this need all around the state, as are many other community service organisations.

I will quote from a community service provider who attended the recent TasCOSS Budget information session. The quote highlights the situation of many organisations:


We are already operating at full stretch. There is simply no room left to squeeze more from the service without risking its integrity. Government needs to fund, support and strengthen the community industry - not dismantle it. 

Yet here we are, with the government signalling cuts to the community service sector. Once again, Tasmanians in need are being deprioritised by this government.

Priorities are also on display in the Corrections and Rehabilitation budget. Capital investment in Corrections tops out at almost $95 million over the forward Estimates. Some of this is stated as being for critical infrastructure maintenance, and the Greens don't dispute the importance of this. What is startling is the amount of money allocated to buildings compared to new money budgeted for rehabilitation: almost $40 million for a new maximum security prison compared to $500,000 for education, rehabilitation, and therapeutic support.

It's almost like this government prefer locking up people to rehabilitating them, which might be okay if locking people up worked, but it doesn't. We have one of the highest rates of recidivism in the country. That means people who return to prison within two years of release for a previous detention. Locking people up leads to more locking people up. That's a large part of why the government believe they need to build more prison space. 

There are other ways. There is plenty of research about this and there are many people in Tasmania with expertise in this area. We could be investing more in rehabilitation and actually making a difference to the lives of people in our prisons. Those people want change. I have spoken to many in prison who are desperate to access rehabilitation and education programs, but they can't. This Corrections and Rehabilitations budget is a choice, and it speaks volumes about the way this government views people who muck up and get caught up in crime, often because their need for support wasn't met when they needed it, especially if they experienced trauma and poverty as a child. 

That brings me to Children and Youth. It's good to see funding allocated for the yet-to-be-established Commission for Children and Young People and ongoing funding for the offices of the independent regulator and implementation monitor. What's concerning is the way commission of inquiry (COI) funding is so hard to find and track in this budget. The government tells us it's still there, but it's hidden in those vague budget lines I talked about earlier.

The way this government presents their budget speaks to what they value, what they want us to see them funding, what they want us to believe of them. Hiding COI implementation funding suggests they would rather us not see exactly what's going on, and if I'm wrong on that, then name it up. Let's see what's being funded and where, because if we can't see it, we are left guessing, wondering and doubting, looking for signs in other budget lines - things like the temporary uplift in funding to children's services that need permanent uplifts. Temporary funding that isn't followed through on, that's a cut. That's where the cuts are hidden in plain sight in this budget and that's where the fantasy comes in, because the forward Estimates in this budget are not achievable. Cuts will come and they will hurt. 

There are two more hidden messages in this budget I want to draw attention to before I finish - the government's attitude to women and disability. Where are women in this budget? Where is the usual gender impact statement that accompanies the budget? It has completely disappeared, which tells us all we need to know about this Treasurer's attitude to women and how the budget effects them. What a shame we aren't evaluating the impact of this budget on women and ensuring we are lifting them up onto an equal footing in our state. 

Regarding disability, we know foundational supports are coming down the line as a shared state responsibility. That should have started by now, but we still don't know what's happening in the disability space. It's another contributor to the fairytale of this budget. We know those costs are coming, yet there is no indicator of this anywhere. When state contributions to foundational supports finally kick in, they will have to be reflected in the budget, and yet we have no indication of what the government is planning to do and how it is going to pay for them. We really need to be planning for this change and factoring it into our thinking about the future.

Finally, there's the biggest fantasy of all: the idea that Tasmania can afford a new stadium that we don't need. The stadium is why this government are looking for cuts and efficiencies wherever they can. They need to save dollars here and there to pay down the debt that's coming. Tasmanians will be paying for this stadium for generations to come, not just with dollars from the budget, but with services and supports gone from their lives. Tasmanians will be missing out for years to come for the glory project of this government, because they refuse to face the truth that we can't afford it. It's not how it should be. We should absolutely be prioritising Tasmanians and the things they need. Shame on this government for getting their priorities so wrong. There is another way. We don't have to do it like this. We could make different choices. We know that because it was outlined this morning by Greens Leader, Dr Woodruff.

I would urge the government to swallow its pride, embrace the collaboration it constantly extols and says it's doing, and seriously look at the Greens' plans for both budget repair and meeting the needs of Tasmanians. Our plans provide a genuine, real and achievable way forward for all Tasmanians. That's what we need.

[4.24 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, a budget is a statement of priorities. It shows what matters to a government, not in slogans but in numbers. This budget does not demonstrate fiscal responsibility or long-term planning. It delays decisions, obscures the real financial position and pushes the cost of today's choices onto future governments and future Tasmanians. 

The Treasurer has presented a projected surplus in 2028-29, but that surplus exists only because the budget counts Commonwealth capital grants as operating revenue, while excluding the associated capital spending. When we use a measure that removes those one-off capital grants, the underlying net operating balance for Tasmania remains in deficit every year of the forward Estimates, totalling about $3.8 billion. That is Treasury's measure. There is no structural surplus ahead.

The government repeatedly claims the budget improves because capital spending drives economic activity. Economic activity doesn't automatically improve the budget. It just means that money is moving around. Government spending improves the budget only when it produces a measurable return; either increased revenue or reduced costs that outweighs what we spend and borrowed. That requires transparent cost-benefit analysis. Yet, major projects, including the stadium, continue without a business case that stacks up or any demonstration that the long-term benefits exceed the cost.

Debt is another area where the public narrative does not match the real financial position. The Treasurer focuses on general government debt reaching $10.4 billion in 2028-29, and describes that as 'peak debt'. That excludes debt held by the Government Business Enterprises: Hydro Tasmania, TasNetworks, TT-Line and TasPorts, which are wholly owned by the state, and whose borrowings are guaranteed by the state. When those debts are included, total public sector debt approaches $19-20 billion by 2028-29. That is real exposure, and the same year the Treasurer claims debt will peak, the budget shows net borrowings of $735 million. Debt has not stabilised; it has been deferred four more years.

A significant and concerning shift is occurring in this budget. Debt is no longer primarily funding infrastructure; it is funding recurrent expenditure - wages and service delivery. Treasury's own fiscal sustainability report states that borrowing to fund recurrent spending is not sustainable in the long-term, yet this budget does exactly that. The budget also assumes significant efficiency measures, but no detail is provided about how these savings will be achieved. To meet the workforce numbers implied in the forward Estimates, the public sector needs to be reduced by around 2800 positions. If wage growth exceeds the budget's very low assumption, the required reduction increases to between 3500 and 4000 positions. That scale of reduction cannot occur without cutting services. Not filling nursing positions reduces health capacity. Not replacing teachers reduces learning support. Not filling child safety roles places children at further risk.

The Treasurer has also reduced the Treasurer's reserve - the buffer used when, inevitably, cost pressures arise. Last year, agencies required $467 million in supplementary appropriations to deal with 'unavoidable' costs. Reducing the reserve does not reduce the need for spending; it's simply deferring when the government will admit to the spending.

While the public and community sectors are told to find efficiencies, the budget does not examine reductions in financial assistance to private industry. Each year, millions of dollars are provided in grants, subsidies, loans and equity injections to private proponents. Many do not include cost-benefit analysis, evaluation of outcomes, or clawbacks if promised results don't materialise. Community services are asked to justify every single dollar, but industry subsidies are often handed out with limited scrutiny, if any. Fiscal restraint applied only to the public and community services is not discipline, it's a preference. If the government is serious about savings and accountability, then industry assistance should be subjected to the same requirements as every other expenditure of public funds.

The Budget also fails to meet core fiscal strategy targets. The state's own fiscal strategy requires their own source revenue be at least 37 per cent of gross state product. This budget does not meet that target and it has no plan to. The Treasury secretary has made it clear that Tasmania cannot repair the budget through economic growth alone. Both expenditure and responsible revenue measures are required. The Treasurer has ruled out considering any revenue options, not on economic grounds, but on ideological ones. Or is it biological? As he says that raising taxes is not in his DNA. Fiscal sustainability is not achieved by ruling out tools before the work begins.

Meanwhile, in the middle of a structural deficit, rising interest costs and negative credit rating outlooks, the government has committed over $600 million to a stadium project that has not demonstrated economic benefit or value for money. As the member for Murchison suggested in her excellent op-ed this morning, 'When you are maxing out the credit card for groceries, buying a boat is not prudent financial management.' I take that example further and suggest that not only is this government putting the grocery bill on the credit card and borrowing to buy the boat, it is then letting a big commercial fishing business use the boat while it continues to pay for all the operational costs of the boat in the vain hope that maybe, one day, the big fishing business might pass on a flathead or two to feed the hungry kids. It is totally irresponsible.

Tasmanians expect that when a government is borrowing to fund essential services, discretionary spending of this magnitude should meet the highest standard of public benefit. This project does not meet that test and the Treasurer himself could not even articulate what the financial public benefit might be for the stadium. When directly asked how much the economic growth generated by the stadium would actually find its way into government coffers, the Treasurer's response was that he could not possibly speculate. Nevertheless, he confidently continues to assert the stadium will pay for schools and hospitals in the future. Those two statements simply do not add up. After Question Time this morning and some scrambling by his advisers, I am sure, he informed the House that there would be $2 million for the AFL's payroll tax. Well, $2 million doth butter no parsnips and it certainly doesn't go anywhere near covering the debt servicing requirements for the stadium borrowings, let alone having anything left over to contribute to schools and hospitals.

Tasmanians simply aren't buying the spin and they are frustrated that the opposition are missing in action on this issue. I am happy to correct the record if I am wrong, but so far, out of eight of the 10 Labor budget reply speeches, I have not heard the 's' word, 'stadium', mentioned once. One of the biggest, if not the biggest risks to the budget not even mentioned once by the opposition. That's incredible. To make matters worse, the Leader of the Opposition took offence to the Leader of the Greens' reference earlier today to Labor's unconditional support for the stadium. Apparently, that's not an accurate reflection of their position. Well, to be fair to the Leader of the Greens, it is very hard to keep up with Labor's position on the stadium. I have counted at least seven and, I suspect by the end of tomorrow, we will have nine.

First, there was a very clear no stadium position, then there was the yes stadium, but only if it is $375 million and not a red cent more, which became the yes, even if it costs more than $375 million, but it has to stack up. Just before the election, it changed to yes regardless of the issues, but we will scrutinise it. That sounds a lot like unconditional support and that's what the media labelled it as. Fifth, during the election, it became a whisper, 'Yes, but we don't want to talk about it or mention it in any election material. After the election, it was widely rumoured that they saw the error of their ways and were contemplating a 'Yes stadium, but only if the TPC says it is okay' position. Today, it appears to be a 'Yes stadium, but we never said it was unconditional support' position. I challenge the two remaining speakers on budget reply for Labor to come into this chamber and name one condition, one line in the sand, upon which they would be prepared to vote against the stadium order if it were crossed. There are plenty to pick from. I suggest budget responsibility might be one that they care to champion and the impact on essential services, given that's a concern they have consistently raised in their contributions thus far, but there could be others. The impact on veterans, the Aboriginal community, heritage, proper planning, proper processes, the list goes on. And it is long.

I won't hold my breath. Instead, I predict, and I hope to God that I am wrong, that the position tomorrow morning will be of position number eight; 'yes, stadium and now we admit it's unconditional support, but we will scrutinise it.' Sadly, by the end of the day tomorrow, I suspect we'll be at the final position, position 9 - 'yes stadium, unconditional support, no scrutiny and let's get this over and done with as quickly as possible because it's a bit awkward for us'. It's a genuinely sad state of affairs. When a budget is in crisis, Tasmanians need an effective opposition standing up for them, not one who votes to make the situation worse. 

Labor has asked and continues to ask great questions about the Spirits of Tasmania fiasco. Unfortunately, as parliament could not have stopped the fiasco from happening, we were only here to scrutinise response in the aftermath, but there are many lessons to be learned. Certainly, at the very least it ought to be to act as a massive deterrent to embarking on a major high-risk project such as the stadium. Labor has the power to save us from a debacle that makes the Spirits look like a mere 'oopsies' moment.

Before I hear the opposition try to sheet home blame for the Liberal government being in government to the crossbench, I remind the House that the opposition refused to even get a briefing from Treasury during caretaker mode, like the crossbench did, to understand the true position of the state's finances, and invite them to take some time for self-reflection and the fact that the community and the crossbench didn't believe they were capable of governing, even in light of the abject failures of the Liberal government.

Tasmanians also need a budget grounded in facts, not accounting tricks. Tasmanians shouldn't need an economics degree to get to the truth. They need acknowledgement of the real debt position, including government corporations, transparency about the underlying operating balance, cost-benefit analyses for major projects before commitments are made and deals are signed, scrutiny of industry assistance alongside public sector spending, responsible and fair revenue reform and protection of essential services.

A credible budget faces problems directly. This Budget defers them. The challenge ahead is not simply one year of budget repair, it requires several years of structural reform. Tasmania deserves a plan that is honest about our financial position and makes balanced decisions to protect services and restore sustainability. This Budget does not do that.

I want to put one final point on the record before I conclude. I put the Treasurer and the government on notice. The May budget must demonstrate that the government is prepared to use all levers of budget repair, not just spending cuts. It must show that the advice of economists and Treasury itself has been taken seriously, including the need to examine responsible revenue options and to scrutinise industry assistance with the same discipline applied to public and community services.

If the next budget does not demonstrate that balanced approach, I reserve the right to vote against it, not because I disagree with government spending priorities. I've voted for budgets in the past where I disagree with elements of spending because I respect it is their prerogative of the executive to set its priorities, but if sound economic advice is ignored, if structural reform is deferred again and if ideology continues to override responsible and equitable budget management, then I cannot support it, particularly when the consequences fall directly on the thousands of Tasmanians who rely on public and community services and on future generations who will inherit the debt. Tasmanians deserves a budget grounded in honesty, evidence, equity and responsibility. Anything less is not good enough.

[4.39 p.m.]
Mr SHELTON (Lyons) - Deputy Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise this afternoon as a member for Lyons to make my contribution to the interim 2025-26 state Budget. Creating a budget for all Tasmanians in any circumstance is not an easy job. To create a budget under tight time frame constraints which provides provisions for forward planning for the state's finances is a testament to the Treasurer and his team, so I congratulate Treasurer Abetz and, of course, the Treasury staff for the wonderful effort they've gone through in order to pull this Budget together.







Mr SHELTON - (cont) the wonderful effort that they've put in to put this budget together, as difficult as it is. We come to this position, with an interim budget because of the state election. Part of the reason for going to the election was people didn't agree with the budget, therefore, we have this interim budget. Treasurer Abetz, thank you for your hard work on this interim budget. I know there have been many considerations made and also some hard decisions required in the creation of a budget and the forward Estimates.

This budget continues to draw from our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future and its focus on maintaining essential services and providing fiscal responsibility and discipline. As a government, this budget has prioritised delivering investment into essential services. We have provided over 68 per cent of the total expenditure across the 2025-26 budget and forward Estimates as an investment into the main areas that the people of Tasmania recognise as the critical areas and that is into health, education, public order and housing.

Health has increased by 12 per cent to $14.5 billion. It's a huge number and people on both sides of the parliament have acknowledged that health is certainly a significant part of this budget. Education has an increased investment by 5 per cent to $9.89 billion and public order and safety increased by 9 per cent to $3.9 billion. Additional investments have also been made in recreation and culture, housing and community amenities, environmental protection and general public services. Resulting, in an overall increase of almost $6 billion to ensure long-term sustainability in all facets of government spending. This interim budget will establish the foundation for a renewed and sustainable approach to long-term budget reform. I understand planning is already being undertaken for the delivery of the May budget in 2026 and will ensure that public spending will align with the ever-changing needs of the broader Tasmanian population.

There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic not only affected the health of our population, but also caused great uncertainty to the sustainability of Tasmania's economy. The results of the pandemic, two state elections, a federal election and various commission of inquiry processes are still being felt through our economy and budget figures today, but we are on the right path to economic and budget recovery.

Tasmania's economy has shown modest growth since 2022-23. Despite higher interest rates and inflation, the Tasmanian labour market has shown steady growth, and Tasmania has the lowest unemployment rate in the country. Much like the national economy, the Tasmania's economy is diverse and contains contributions from a wide range of sectors. We are fortunate that Tasmania's economy grew by 1.4 per cent in the 2023-24 fiscal year. Which is a rate much the same as the growth in the national economy. This growth occurred despite many economic challenges, such as uncertainty in the global economy, flow-on effects from higher inflation and impacts from the higher interest rates, and a very negative opposition. In the 2024-25 fiscal year, the state's financial situation is estimated to have grown 3.8 per cent, the highest growth over the same period Australia-wide.

I'm proud to say that Tasmania's economic position has grown overall during the last seven years and we have the fastest growing state economy in the country despite the many challenges faced over this time.

Whilst this is an interim budget, with forward planning underway for the 2026-27 budget, there will be much work occurring by this government to see the state's finances returned to surplus by 2029. Despite the negativity of some within the Chamber, this is fantastic news for the people of Tasmania, and it shows the Rockliff government is delivering what the people are asking for. As the government, we will in this budget invest $10 million per day into the public health system, and expand access to healthcare services across the board, including mental health and wellbeing support. We will build a better education system to help lift literacy rates and expand access to child and early education. It will make life affordable with increased support for first home buyers, tripling the first home owner grant to $30,000, and continued expansion of the scope of pharmacy care to reduce the required visits to GPs. We will then provide ongoing support for Neighbourhood Houses and emergency food relief providers and continue half-price bus fares.

Boosting frontline services includes giving our police the tools they need to keep Tasmanians safe, as seen in our recent rollout of metal-detection devices. Delivering more homes for those who need them most and helping more Tasmanians achieve the dream of home ownership through the Stamping Out of Stamp Duty program for housing up to $750,000 in value. My home, the electorate of Lyons, is well supported in this interim budget, benefiting people in rural and regional areas, from small communities to large agricultural areas.

The Rockliff government has committed to the construction of infrastructure for Ambulance Tasmania with two new stations in Longford and Bicheno, as well as Legana, King Island, Snug and Cygnet. Ambulance services and their scope of practice in healthcare play a vital role in all our lives and these new stations will improve services to the people of Tasmania as a whole. Along with further recruitment of full-time paramedics, with those workers being deployed in our regional communities, our ambulance care practices will be vastly improved.

In the health sector, we have also committed to delivering further upgrades in stage two of the $3.9 million improvements to the Midlands Multipurpose Health Centre, and to complete the new northern eating disorder clinic in Prospect Vale, which is well in to construction. It looks great along Westbury Road. Along with continuing the redevelopment of the Royal Hobart Hospital, which will include the expansion of the emergency services, this government is also delivering 27 new mental health beds, as well as a new eating disorder facility at the St Johns Park Health and Wellbeing precinct, with an added 40-bed older person mental health facility also located at St Johns. Included in this budget for Tasmania is the investment in the new Public Diagnostic Breast Care Centre and Cancer Wellness Centre, something which will benefit Tasmanians statewide.

In the north of the state, covering northern Lyons and the surrounding areas, we have committed to continuing redevelopment of the Launceston General Hospital, doubling the emergency department and research areas. There are also plans in the new Northern Heart Centre and a brand new mental health precinct at the LGH.

Education certainly has not been neglected in this budget. Work has already commenced on the $32 million commitment in building four supersize child and family early learning centres to meet the growing demand on the childhood and early learning sector. Funds have been allocated to build one of these centres in Longford and the search for a suitable location is underway. This facility will add to the other centres that are currently under construction or fully operating in Tasmania. These purpose-built facilities support children from birth to age five, along with parents and carers. It also allows families to access free support services and activities to assist them with the challenges of parenting and early childhood development. This also includes free access to psychologists, speech pathologists and social workers.

Our Rockliff government also provides an enormous amount of support to our schools and education, laying the groundwork to for further employment within Tasmania. As we all know, education is the key to the empowerment. New school buildings have recently been completed at Brighton and Sorell, and work is underway at Cambridge Primary School, allowing state-of-the-art facilities to be accessed by our students. Funding for upgrades has also been approved in my electorate of Lyons at Deloraine High School, Dodgers Ferry High School, East Derwent Primary School and Campbell Town District High School, ensuring we are investing in the appropriate funds to support the education of our youth in regional and rural areas.

We are growing our healthy schools lunch program, ensuring that nutritional meals are supplied to thousands of students. This, in turn, helps to increase levels of concentration in the classroom whilst also tackling the cost-of-living crisis, a problem we know is on the minds of many Tasmanian families. We have also committed to making the classroom more inclusive, investing an additional $10 million statewide to support over 8600 students with disabilities.

Transport works funded in this budget mean getting you home sooner and safer. New infrastructure building and roadwork programs will mean the duplication of the Midway Point and Sorell Causeways and also the Tasmanian Highway between the Hobart Airport and Midway Causeway. Investments will also occur with the replacement of the Sorell Rivulet Bridge and further upgrades to the Lyell Highway. There will also be $6 million invested into the upgrades of Wielangta Road.

The Rockliff government is aware that families are suffering under a nationwide cost-of-living crisis. We have ensured that this budget delivers assistance to the people of Tasmania where it's needed most. Tasmania has come a long way, but there's still more work to do. We must keep Tasmania moving forward and continue to grow our economy, so that we can deliver the infrastructure and services that Tasmanians need. This interim budget continues to build on the gains that the Tasmanian government has made over the past decade. This budget drives the delivery of the 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania and puts us in a great financial position moving forward. I commend the budget.

[4.55 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon) - Deputy Speaker, why is it when the Premier says he's intervened in things, they always get worse? The ferry fiasco is a case in point, but there are many more examples. It's like the Premier has completely lost touch with reality, like he is part of some parallel universe, where every problem is 'regrettable'.

As someone who believes in the importance of institutions, democracy and good governance, it's incredibly difficult to accept the new norm in this parliament and the detrimental impact it's having on Tasmanians. Our budget is in crisis. The Liberals are responsible for the ferry fiasco. Our health, housing and education outcomes are the worst in the country. There are 81,500 Tasmanians living in poverty, and every policy decision of the Liberals has led us to this point. Just a few short months ago, the then-treasurer, Guy Barnett, handed down arguably the worst budget in Tasmania's history, pulled together by arguably the worst government in Tasmania's history. Let it not be lost on this House that that is a rare feat; to not have your budget passed. That is significant. 

I want to take a moment to remind the House, particularly those who are newly elected to this place, that shortly thereafter the Premier of Tasmania lost the confidence of this House. A vote of no confidence in the Premier passed this House, supported by Labor, the Greens and some Independents, including Mr Garland and Ms Johnston. This lack of confidence was directly related to the Premier's terrible management of the state's finances, the unprecedented budget crisis with debt and deficit as far as the eye can see, the Spirit of Tasmania ferry fiasco and Premier Jeremy Rockliff's privatisation plan. Remember that one?

Just a few short months on, the make-up of this parliament might have changed, but most of the issues remain. We have a new treasurer, and I congratulate the honourable Eric Abetz on his new role and responsibilities. If history is anything to go by, we will see a very different approach to fiscal management in the state; and that's quite rightly sounding alarm bells for essential workers across our public sector. Time will tell, but I believe it's going to be an even tougher time for our public sector workers, including our nurses, teachers and support staff who, alongside Tasmanians, will ultimately pay the price for this Liberal minority government's budget mismanagement. 

Our public sector workers deserve better pay and conditions, and we stand side-by-side with them in their fight. Mr Rockliff might have backflipped on his privatisation plan which, by the way, he believed in, just like he believed in the salmon industry and the greyhound racing industry prior to the 2025 election, promptly dropping that support to save his own skin and stay in government as the Premier of Tasmania.

A few constants do remain. Put simply, you can't trust the Premier, Jeremy Rockliff. The community can't trust him; business can't trust him. His own Liberal PLP can't trust him. He will throw anyone under a bus, including his own colleagues, to save his own job. Integrity doesn't mean much to the Liberals. You don't have to go that far back. Do you remember Adam Brooks - or was it Terry Brooks? Who would know? The unanswered questions about the Sports minister way back when, who stood aside but was subsequently reappointed as a minister, despite Tasmanians never being fully informed of the outcome of an integrity investigation?

Time marches on, but those of us who have been here a while don't forget. The Liberals will always put the Liberal Party above Tasmanians. It's in their DNA. They've put party before state, pursuing power for the sake of it and seeking government at all costs. That's why we are in the mess that we are in.

That's why, along with wanting to save his own job, Jeremy Rockliff, did a deal with the Greens and green Independent protest parties, to hold onto government, selling out hard-working regional Tasmanians, and breaking his commitment and his team's commitment to not be involved in a Green coalition. The Greens and two Independents chose to support the Liberals back into government just months after having no confidence in the Premier of this state. As I've said before, it's a funny old world that we live in, but here we are. It's clear now that the Greens and the Independents back the government, which gives them little to no credibility in this place to criticise a government that they enabled.

A budget might just be a set of numbers on a page, but that set of numbers tells us a story. The annual Budget and Estimates should set out a vision, not just for the immediate financial year, but for the forward Estimates and beyond. In this year's budget, we don't even have dollars allocated in the out years for some of the line items, and there's no explanation around that. Vision and leadership have been lacking from this government for some time. I will give them credit where it's due, in that when they came to office, they had fire in their belly and an agenda; but that's all gone. They are now in survival mode and that's not good for them. You can see it in their faces but it's not good for Tasmanians either. This is an interim budget to get us through to May when the real budget will be handed down. The Liberals can't even present a real budget, let alone criticise us for not having an alternate one.

Tasmanians, like our TT-Line, are treading water as our fiscal position continues to go from bad to worse. The interim Budget tells a story of a Liberal minority government that has squandered the good times in Tasmania and taken us to three early elections in seven years to hold power in this state. Our leader, Josh Willie, described the government as an advertising company, and I couldn't agree more. All spin, no substance, rinse and repeat. That catches up with you in the end. 

Every decision this government has made has had economic consequences for Tasmania and those costs have taken a toll. The Liberals have effectively blown the budget. In fact, Saul Eslake confirms this in his independent review of Tasmania's state finances. The Liberals have a direct responsibility for budget repair, full stop. They can't palm that off to the parliament, but you watch them try to. On that independent report, I think it's important not to forget that we only have that independent report from Mr Eslake because it was contingent on the Liberals forming a minority government. That's right. They agreed to it in order to form government with the Jacqui Lambi Network (JLN). To make matters worse, they agreed to it to get to where they wanted to be in a cosy coalition of chaos with the JLN after degrading the JLN in right through the election campaign. Sound familiar? History repeats itself. They dismissed that report and when Premier Jeremy Rockliff lost the support of the crossbench, he took us to an early election.

In that report, Mr Eslake states that there is a direct correlation between the policies and fiscal decisions made and taken by the Liberal government dating back to 2018, which was when I first came into this place. This, of course, has been exacerbated by consecutive unnecessary early elections and long lists of election commitments. The 2024 election saw Tasmanians pay for 480 new spending promises that the Liberals made to buy their way back into government. Let's not forget, this interim budget doesn't contain the latest round of election commitments they made that might not see the light of day yet - don't bank on the letter that the premier sent you; his word is not worth the paper that it's written on. His promises are worth nothing. 

Speaking of works of fiction. The question that is on every Tasmanian's lips, other than when will the Spirit saga ever end, is where is the Premier's TasInsure jacket? He wore it for pretty much the entire election campaign, and we haven't seen it since. It's a bit like the policy. The signs are down, the office is closed, and we still have no idea what TasInsure actually is, how much it will cost, and it's beginning to feel a bit like the underground bus mall; a pipe dream. The promises of $250 off your insurance policy and cheaper groceries have amounted to nothing, leaving the Premier looking more and more like a shady door to door insurance salesman in a dodgy jacket than the leader of the state. It's pretty sad because insurance premiums are of a concern to many Tasmanians and Tasmanian businesses that I speak to. The cost of living is affecting Tasmanians. The Liberals know that, and they used it to their advantage during the election campaign. I say shame on them.

Why is it when the Premier intervenes, as I've said, things get worse? That's what's happened with the replacement of our beloved Spirits. I make no apologies for banging the drum, honourable Treasurer, because if it wasn't for us continually asking questions about this project, Tasmania would still be in the dark. It's like a state of utopia on the other side of this house when it comes to this project. Most of the time actually. 

For the record, I want to take you through the list again. Let's get it on the record again. An $80 million bailout; a $403 million cost blow out on the berth at Devonport that they forgot to build; a $13 million blowout on the price of the ships; $5.9 million on a highland fling and counting; a $9 million fender upgrade after taking ownership of the ships; a $75 million bailout in this budget, the bailout budget; $500 million opportunity cost every year they are delayed; and local content is a work of fiction, $60 million of the $100 million was local content from Finland. Absolutely incredible, but there's nothing to see here. 

When's it going to end? When will Tasmanians have all of the answers about this project and certainty that our state-owned freight and passion to ferries aren't broke and putting at risk our tourism industry and the livelihoods of primary producers and our economy. I'm really concerned about the Premier's dismissal of the Auditor-General's finding in relation to TT-Line's insolvency in August this year. It's alarming.

Should we just get rid of all of the oversight in this state and leave Premier Rockliff to it? No wonder Tasmania is the laughingstock of the country. The role of the Auditor-General in Tasmania is to provide independent assurance to parliament and the public on the financial management and performance of state entities. This involves conducting annual financial audits of government departments, public bodies and local councils, as well as performance audits to examine the efficiency and effectiveness and economy of government operations and compliance with laws and policies. It's a very serious role. It's a very serious issue. The Auditor-General also has the power to conduct special investigations into the use of public resources and reports the findings directly to parliament. This is qualified advice, and if the Premier has sought advice to the contrary, he should table it. Has he not learned a thing? It was instructing directors to play in the sandpit, and largely ministers and the premier of the day having their head in the sand that got us in this mess.

Premier, do your job and show some responsibility. There is far too much at stake for you to continue to wash your hands of the worst infrastructure stuff-up in history. It's your government's fault. You need to own it. We will continue to ask the questions because I reckon this has got a bit to go yet and unlike your government, we're on the side of Tasmanians who want answers.

I am so pleased, to be responsible for the shadow portfolio infrastructure, tourism and events, Aboriginal affairs, and local government. I'm looking forward to estimates, to drilling down and understanding exactly what you've allocated where and what you've cut where.

Our tourism industry is something indeed to be proud of. It employs 50,000 Tasmanians across our beautiful state, that's one in three regional Tasmanians, which is really important. Last Friday, I enjoyed celebrating with our successful tourism businesses across the state at the annual gala awards evening. Tourism certainly is a Tasmanian success story. But I put the government on notice about their funding. Funding for our tourism needs to industry needs to be a new focus for this government, so take note of that.

Aboriginal Affairs is an enormous privilege to take on and I look forward to working with our Aboriginal communities, create change and make progress across key priority areas. I thank all our Aboriginal communities who I've met with in recent weeks and months in taking on the shadow portfolio, who have been so generous with their time in meeting with me.

That brings me to my infrastructure portfolio and, of course, I've spoken about the Spirits and the mess that they've created, but I want to talk about another mess that the Liberals have created and that's the state of our roads, which is an absolute disgrace, particularly across the north of the state and down to the west coast. I want to up front thank our civil construction workers and the companies for the great work that they are doing across our state and it was my great pleasure to join them last Friday for President Jack's lunch.

It seems that industry are okay with the interim infrastructure budget but there does need to be more work done by this government around contracts, getting them out the door and getting the work out the door so that they can get on and get their jobs done in good weather.

During the election campaign, my colleague, Dean Winter, and I, we worked really closely with the industry to come up with a five-point plan to fix Tasmania's roads. We have come up with some solutions to this and that's about using Tasmanian materials for Tasmanian roads, awarding contracts earlier for work to commence before the rain and bad weather set in, and building Tasmanian roads to Tasmanian standards. It's pretty simple, and we have the support of the industry in that work that we did. Just on Saturday, I was down the west coast again and I hit a massive segment of potholes just before Tullah. I want to stay in this House that it is so dangerous. There was no signage to warn people that you were coming across it. There was no speed reduction and if you hit that in the night, I am really concerned that someone will be killed when they hit one of these potholes on our roads. It is incredibly dangerous, and this government needs to fix our roads, and it needs to make sure that they give good notice to people and put signage up when there's a dangerous area, particularly at night and particularly for our tourists who aren't familiar with our roads. I hope by saying that today and putting that on the record that they actually take some notice.

That brings me to local government who do a great job with roads in local communities, as a side point, but really just to thank the local government sector for the work that they're doing across our communities and just to acknowledge the piecemeal legislation that keeps coming to this place when it comes to legislation from this government. I look forward to meeting with representatives from local government across the state in the coming weeks at their annual conference and the events that are associated with that. 

That brings me to my beautiful electorate of Braddon. It feels like I've been talking about a lot of these issues for a very long time in this place, but I will keep talking about them, and that is more funding for Montello Primary School. There's a bit more funding in there, but there's a long way to go. I note that the funding for Havenview and Burnie Primary Schools has also been pushed out, and that the rhododendron gardens only have one more year of recurrent funding, which needs to be addressed. 

We are finally seeing progress on the Burnie courts development, and I hope we get to see it completed by 2027, as promised by the government.

Finding a park at the North West Regional Hospital can be like finding a needle in a haystack. When is the additional parking going to be coming online as part of stage 1 of the redevelopment? It has been promised, but we are still waiting. 

The agricultural sector continues to have concerns about biosecurity, particularly given the recent mop-top incursion, and the muted cuts to biosecurity are very concerning.

The North West Regional Hospital new mental health precinct hasn't started yet. You say it's going to start in 2025. When is it going to start? It is an absolutely critical piece of health infrastructure to provide services across our region that's desperately needed. Then there's the hydrotherapy pool. During the election, an announcement was made to just close that down, and when you close the pool without telling anyone at the North West Regional Hospital, you need to actually understand how that's going to work. There's been no details of that provided, and no consultation with the people that will be using that pool. I will call on the government to do some work around that and I look forward to asking some more questions in Estimates. 

I conclude where I commenced, and that's by saying that it's like this Premier has completely lost touch with reality. Perhaps if the Premier put as much time and energy into being premier of this state as he does being a social media influencer, we would be in better shape. Don't get me wrong - I am a fan of Party in the Paddock and I hope to get there this year. It's a fantastic event and it's a fantastic line-up this year, but Premier of the party? Really? I love Peking Duk, but that's a bit lame duck, in my opinion. That's just the opinion of one woman. 

[5.13 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, well, 11 years since the Liberals took office and our budget problems have grown significantly. There is no foundation now to blame past governments; this historical budget hole is solely the Liberals' legacy. This budget comes at a time when:

Poverty in Tasmania has risen 16 per cent in the past two years; 

Tasmania still has the lowest literacy and numeracy rates; 

Tasmania has the lowest digital literacy and connectivity rates in the nation; and

Appropriate, safe housing is out of reach for many.

This budget is a political choice to put corporate profits and interests ahead of people and the planet. Meaningful budget repair has been kicked down the pothole-riddled road. This has been a missed opportunity here to, for example, raise mining royalties 40 per cent so Tasmania is in line with other states around the country. There have been a number of people, including economist Saul Eslake, who argue that the government should make the multi-billion-dollar, multinational companies pay royalties. We're in a position now where we should be charging the salmon companies, because right now, we are not getting anything from letting them effectively ruin our waterways. Nothing. They profit while our waterways choke, and when the waterways become too toxic for them to farm their salmon, they will leave and we will be the ones left to clean up their mess. When that day comes, we will look back and wonder why we didn't have the courage to charge them while we still had something left to protect. 

This budget is almost as much as a fantasy as the historical fictional piece that was the Barnett budget. This budget, which already sets out record debt, still does not include the inevitable future bailout of TT-Line, the increase in Estimates for transmission lines constructions which will need to be applied to the North West Transmission line, and the acquisition for 'corridors'. There's the project doubling of costs for pumped hydro at Cethana, ageing infrastructure, such as the Edgar Dam, which has to be maintained by Hydro Tasmania, now also in strife. The costs of strengthening have gone from $15 million to $35 million and the project still isn't done. To come is Scotts Peak Dam. That cost was $50 million, it's now up to $99 million and the planning stage isn't complete.

We are being sold the stadium at Macquarie Point as generational equity, but what about generational equality? What about not burdening future Tasmanians with a stadium that polls show the majority of Tasmanians today don't even want, and instead invest in setting future Tasmanians up with world-class education, a healthy environment, access to healthcare as it's needed, affordable housing, training, and well-paid jobs? Instead, we're seeing record numbers of young people leave. No, they're not leaving because they want to live near a roofed stadium, they're going to find education, affordable housing, and careers - opportunities that should have been afforded to them right here in Tasmania.

In Primary Industries, it is imperative that we upscale investment into biosecurity, and I want to congratulate the biosecurity workers on the mop-top virus. As we're dealing with an outbreak such as that, and we have the inevitable arrival of bird flu to come as well, where is the resourcing for everything else? 

We need to see invasive species under control. They're already costing our primary producers and our farmers too much and they're destroying the natural values of our parks and the Wilderness World Heritage Area. Foxglove has rightfully been declared a listed weed now, but where's the extra management resourcing? Fallow deer populations are exponentially increasing, but the funding hasn't been matched to that growth rate. Rainbow lorikeets need controlling, and just today a volunteer working on that program was awarded a biosecurity award from the minister, but where's the state funding to actually support them? We can't rely exclusively on volunteers to deal with our invasive species issue. It is a state issue. That includes recreational hunters with deer, which I note is totally redundant - it's a totally redundant move in peri-urban areas. We must invest to ensure Tasmania's environmentally intact and productive future is for all. We should see investment to upscale invasives eradication in places like Bruny Island. That could be an absolute test case in biosecurity areas. It can be deer-free, cat-free and weed-free.

Tasmania's celebrated farm gate value, its paddock-to-plate reputation, relies on good biosecurity, and the affordability for small producers. I want to note the new regulation changes, which are national, are raising great concern for market growers and roadside stall holders. For a government that absolutely loves cutting a bit of red and green tape, overcoming these regulations shouldn't be a hassle, right? You can have a fair tiered system that ensures the state's national compliance for branding reliability but does not make for unrealistic administrational costs for small operators.

Water is our lifeline and the 2024 State of the Environment report was clear on the need for water quality monitoring, and for annual reports on river health as we see our waterways' health decline. Tasmania is past due for statutory water management plans and water catchment authorities to oversee those plans. I note that there is now just $444,000 for the Rural Water Use Strategy, and then nothing else in the forward Estimates. On a drying planet with growing demand, managing our water is fast becoming more than essential. I note that we don't have the environmental flow reports for Marinus Link. Under Basslink, preparation of a huge amount of work was done to assess rivers' health with the altered water flow rates for power generation under projected demand scenarios. It is lazy and poor project management that this crucial work has been neglected before the decisions on Marinus were pushed through.

What about ecosystem restoration funding? What about repairing what's already been degraded? Ecosystem restoration in this state, and indeed in this nation, is our next biggest industry. To restore degraded landscapes, create meaningful employment with physical and mental health benefits - it can be a transitional employment pathway as we exit extractive, archaic industries that are contributing to the climate crisis, into a restorative, regenerative future.

In our parks, we welcome that the fanciful Cradle cableway has gone. That's a project that went from $60 million to $190 million to $225 million. See, inflation - it's a thing with projects. What's going to happen with the Tyndall proposal? Maintaining the $40 million price tag from 2021, after it had already doubled from $20 million previous to that, is completely misleading. Where is the cost coming for that extra funding? It's not in the Budget. Is it coming from the Parks budget? 

It's the same with the Freycinet gateway. I note the Parks proposal is not supported by the community and that there is a better vision from the community themselves that is going to be launched soon. It's a better vision for the future of Freycinet that's a win-win-win for locals, for business, and for our beloved national park. It's expected that it will be not only cheaper to produce, but more ecologically friendly. Most importantly, it will actually have a social licence. It will also be consistent with the Freycinet management plan. Again, when governments ignorantly fail to listen and hear the community, the community step up and find even better solutions.

Statistically, the number of people who are coming to this state for nature-based tourism experiences is still steadily dominating the market as a key drawcard, so where is the funding for additional rangers to look after our parks and maintain our beloved walking tracks? This government should be investing in protecting presently under-protected areas of great value, and proclaiming Takayna as a National Park as part of the Wilderness World Heritage Area. It will bring tourism and economic value to the regional communities in the west and north-west. The same can be said of the Tyndall Range and the Spero-Wanderer Wilderness for the west.

I note the abundance of new walking opportunities for all abilities that could be invested in in these areas, to make our wild places truly equitably accessible for everybody. Our tourism businesses are already using Tasmania's globally significant dark skies to leverage and brand their products; but the state will lose our brand credibility to other dark sky destinations who have protected their night sky environment through dark sky accreditation. If we continue to neglect ours, we will lose that market advantage. The Southwest Sky Country international dark sky sanctuary is one signature away. Just sign it. Most of the groundwork has already been done, again by volunteers in lieu of Parks being resourced to do it. 

Expanding protected areas was a State of the Environment Report recommendation for biodiversity and climate safeguarding. It's a win-win-win; in addition to the environment, for the economy and for social equality for all Tasmanians and people around the world who come here.

I note that still the work to be able to declare Aboriginal protected areas in Tasmania has not been done, and that is a great shame.

As has already been stated, women are absent from the budget. This must be reversed in May. We must see the women's budget statement returned. Perhaps in that is the place where we so desperately need a clear breakdown of investment into the four principal pillars of the Family Violence Action Plan. 

I note in the annual report, family violence response by police had escalated by 30 per cent in the past two years. These are difficult statistics to quantify what's behind it. Is there just a general increase that police have been called to incidents from people who are seeing it, from neighbours? Or are more women feeling supported and being able to call for help? Either way, over 6400 responses is far too high for Tasmania in 2025. That is an average of 17.5 domestic violence incident responses every single day. 

Yesterday, in his speech, the Premier said that no Tasmanian would be left behind. Premier, what about the Tasmanian women and children who are moving interstate because they cannot be kept safe here, because our systems are not only failing them but there is systemic abuse being used?

Where is the Family Violence Act 2004 review that was in your 2030 Strong Plan? The 100-day plan, then the 200-day plan and then the 300-day plan? It's still not here.

Funding for the North West Arch centre is good to see. I was privileged to tour the Southern Arch Centre recently, and it was fantastically insightful to see how the sector intertwines with police to create supporting systems that are working well. While there have been growth issues to begin with - of course there would be - they are finding ways to collaboratively overcome them. Wouldn't it be great to see this model used as a blueprint for a similar, albeit it would need to be much bigger, family and domestic violence centres in the not-too-distant future? 

The electronic rostering for police that's bringing Tas Police into the modern world is, of course, very welcome, but diversionary programs for the prevention of crime have not seen the investment needed. There is funding for tough-on-crime policy rather than prevention and education, which research demonstrates is what works. We know the tough-on-crime response doesn't work. It's a political tactic that does nothing to address the long-term root cause of the problem. It's like the principles underpinning the commission of inquiry have been totally lost and forgotten on this government. 

There is further investment directed into the Family Violence Offender Intervention Program, but last year the program saw 68 commencements and just 26 completions. By comparison, in the Sober Driving Program 49 people commenced that and 48 completed it. Where is it going wrong? There was a continued increase in the breaches of Family Violence Orders and Police Family Violence Orders by a couple of hundred each.

We call on the new Minister for Women to hold a long-overdue roundtable with the family, domestic and sexual violence sector to forge a new and better way forward for a safer Tasmania.

In the age of climate change, more funding is needed towards emergency services. The SES new vehicle funding is, of course, welcome, but what's this government doing to help support the uptake of volunteer, to ensure that the volunteers, particularly in the SES, have all their modern equipment that they need to do their jobs efficiently and effectively and that that's funded and resourced and they're not dipping into their own pockets?

I'd like to add here that it is very much welcome to see, even if it is so far only in this budget and not in the Forward Estimates that parks have the capacity for a bushfire winch support. It is essential that it is part of their budget moving forward.

Forward Estimates show the budget for TFS for emergency services will decline. With climate change driving more extreme weather events, including fires and floods, why isn't this funding reflective of that in the Forward Estimates? It should be. We know it's coming.

TasTAFE has seen such poor infrastructure investment over the years that its own campuses have become both fiscal and safety hazards. I note in the budget, there is $450,000 for the future automotive centre planning, which is welcome, albeit I am biased, but this is what we should see happening, proper long-term planning in place so when the time comes the state is ready to transition to new facilities and training models as they are needed.

But not everybody wants to be a mechanic or a plumber or a builder. Some want to study in screener media and be part of the state's growing industry. With shows like Alone and Bay of Fires being filmed right here in Tasmania, international award-winning films are out of here, such as the film Pedder.

The government acknowledges the importance of the Arts Centre in Tasmania in the budget, and even in this budget under the arts industry development outputs their alliance around individual artists, arts organisations and major Tasmanian cultural institutions through the arts output 5.3 says it is to provide support for professional development and seeks to promote Tasmanian talent, creativity, stories to a worldwide audience and employment and economic activity in the state.

Now, surely all of this path is really just taking the mickey. While the arts, screen and media courses at TAFE, which have had wait lists of prospective students are losing subsidies funding and lab tech, where over 50 per cent of students go on to be employed in the health sector, the majority of others go into education and food safety. This subsidy funding has been sent to private mainland RTOs without any data that shows that their study completion, satisfaction and employment success rates are any better than that of which TasTAFE has offered locally.

In the Digital Inclusion Report released last week, Tasmania ranked the worst performing state in digital inclusion and literacy in the nation, all while our essential online access centres have been shut or defunded. As technology takes off the communities, core assets are being stripped when we need the most revamped and upscaled.

Tasmania needs affordable telecommunication. We could be clean, green and connected. Instead, as we're seeing more upgrades in the network, the connectivity seems to be coming worse. The Great Lakes and Tasman Communities are both screaming out for a fair service, which is what they're paying for, while receiving a second rate, if any service. It has been so bad in these areas that emergency responders have been unable to make contact with the people who need help in emergencies.

In my electorate of Longford, communities welcome the funding. The community in Longford are welcoming the funding for the much-needed child and early learning centre which they've been waiting for in angst. But will progress begin now or will this cut? Or will this centre be cut come may? What certainty has been provided for the Longford community now?

Several communities in the Northern Midlands which have presently unused police houses and stations have been trying for years to acquire the state government owned assets to create community centres that have been presently missing in the region. For example, in Evandale, the doctor's surgery is in need of expansion, and they could use their police house. Their catchment is beyond the local region to the Fingal Valley and beyond.

In Perth, a community hub is being proposed by the Lions Club, the Perth Historical Association and the Perth Progress Association. This is a move that has been backed by the Northern Midlands Council. They've said that they're going to write to the Treasurer as a pitch to get this much needed community asset in a rapidly expanding area. In Longford, they are seeking the old police house for a neighbourhood house, which the Northern Midlands, an incredibly vast area, is otherwise without.

Instead of investing in these holistic social pursuits designed and run by the community by means of giving public assets to the community, this government wants to flog them off to the highest bidder for a cheap, quick budget top-up that won't go anywhere near touching the sides of the stadium-sized hole.

We always expected the environment to suffer in this budget, but for the economy to suffer for the extent it does, is quite something else. This is a political choice and it doesn't have to be this way. As the Greens presented today, our costed alternatives for greater social and environmental outcomes for Tasmania, our plan, would improve the bottom line by $ 1.5 billion. That's the tangible figure. 

The policies and programs on climate action, and funding all of the State of the Environment Report recommendations, will help safeguard a stable environment for future Tasmanians. We can create a safer future which will help alleviate weather extremities, provide equitable access to all in protected and public land, and help secure the future for our primary producers. Let's see future equality for Tasmanians, socially and environmentally, so that we all get a fair go.

[5.31 p.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise today to speak on the interim budget handed down by the Honourable Treasurer in this place last week. I do so acknowledging that this interim budget only became necessary because those opposite decided not to pass the normal May budget this year. We need budget repair and we need it now, they said; but as it turned out, the Tasmanian people did not trust Labor to do the job. The Tasmanian people showed fairly clearly they believe only a Rockliff Liberal government could be trusted to actually get the job done, and get it done without trashing our way of life through higher taxes and wildly increased costs of the central government services.

Any mug government can drop a slash-and-burn budget to achieve a surplus through higher taxes and charges, and drastically reduce government services. We could have done that, but it would have harmed the Tasmanian people, and there is always a better way forward than just blowing up what's already there.

Tasmanians know our beloved state is a much better place to live, a better place to work and a better place to raise a family than it was before the Hodgman Liberal government was elected back in 2014. Unemployment is at a record low; 4 per cent, the lowest in the nation. Let's think about that for a second: the lowest in the nation, little old Tassie. Over that period of time, since 2014, our economy has grown by 20 per cent, which is huge. The fact that 51,000 jobs have been created here in Tasmania is all you need to know about the fundamental strength of our economy since 2014, because you don't get jobs growth outside the public service without business investment.

To get higher rates of business investment and secure the jobs that flow from that, those investors must have confidence that the economy they are investing in is growing strong and resilient. That confident investment in Tasmania has seen those 51,000 jobs created and Tasmania consistently leading the nation on many economic indicators over that time. That's not an opinion; it's a fact.

This is why everyday Tasmanians often question me about why Labor is so relentlessly negative. The people know those opposite are just playing politics. The trouble is, the negativity from Labor has a real impact on the people of this state, and it's not a good impact.

By so consistently talking us down, potential investors - always a courteous bunch, rather, at the best of times - can get nervous about creating a new industry or business here in Tasmania. Some of them are looking to expand and grow their current business presence here. They get nervous too. 

They shouldn't get nervous, because this Rockliff Liberal government has got this. The hard economic data is all there. Yes, there have been mistakes; yes, there is pressure on the budget; yes, we are being short-changed by the federal Labor government on health, disability and aged care funding; but this interim budget is designed to maintain government services while setting us on a confident journey towards a modest budget surplus over the forward Estimates. 

The hard work done by the Treasurer, the honourable Eric Abetz, and his staff should not be underestimated; work that has already been recognised. The NAB Business Confidence Survey out yesterday said Tasmania is number one, and the latest Business Council of Australia report, citing a raft of government reforms to issues like red tape and tax regimes, is encouraging business confidence, just to name a couple. It appears the NAB and the BCA are not just listening to Labor's rampant negativity.

Our strategy to achieve a budget surplus includes Liberal government policies helping to grow the Tasmanian economy so we can afford to fund the government services Tasmanians deserve. That equation, that a strong economy means we can spend on valuable services for all Tasmanians and care for our most disadvantaged, forms the basis of the campaign I took to the people in 2024 and again this year.

That equation is not hard to understand, so what is the reality since I was elected this place in 2024? What is the actual record of this Liberal government? In fact, government services are now funded at record levels. Just pick your portfolio. Record investments in health for all Tasmanians. Record investments to educate our young people. Record spending on roads and bridges to increase our productivity and safety. Record investments on other essential infrastructure, including hospitals and schools. Record funding for Neighbourhood Houses who help keep our unique and awesome communities together. Record spending on mental health services and programs to help our kids. Record spending on a criminal justice system, including the construction of a new youth justice facility. Record spending on police, fire and ambulance, critical to keeping Tasmanians safe and well. When there is a need, this government steps up.

The cost-of-living increases are a national issue, but this government has delivered hundreds of millions in concession funding to support vulnerable Tasmanians. The struggle for many to own a home is another national issue, and this government has again stepped up and is tripling the First Home Owners grant to $30,000. We are also stamping out stamp duty for most first home buyers. These are game changers for young Tasmanians struggling to enter the housing market to raise their own families. To create additional housing supply, this government is on track to deliver 10,000 new homes by 2032. We are also reducing red tape in the construction sector and supporting innovative construction techniques to further stimulate home building.

Just in my seat of Bass and with a focus on my role as Parliamentary Secretary for Youth Engagement and Sport, there is some good news in this interim budget. Most of you know in this place how passionate I am about engaging our youth in education and sports, and this budget delivers in key areas to get better outcomes for our young people. Our school-building blitz program continues with upgraded learning facilities for Mowbray Heights and Ringarooma primary schools and funding to commence the upgrade of South George Town Primary School and it's amazing driving past a recently opened school at Legana as I head along the West Tamar regularly. In Scottsdale, this government is funding the construction of a brand new child and family learning centre. This government is delivering funding for playgrounds in indoor and outdoor sports courts across Tasmania, including Scottsdale High School, Newstead College, Exeter Primary School and Beaconsfield Primary School.

These are investments in Tasmania's future, but not everything is bricks and mortar. Studies from all over the world show that kids learning improves significantly if they have full bellies. We all strive for better education outcomes for young Tasmanians, and this government is expanding delivery of the school lunch programs across northern schools. We're also funding a free universal school breakfast program in Tasmanian schools. These are real investments in our children's positive engagement with learning. Children who will become the next generation of adults in charge of their own destinies and the destiny of Tasmania.

This government is also committed to improving health and connections within a diverse communities across Bass, committing $46.3 million towards the Northern Suburbs Community Recreation Hub in Launceston. This amazing facility, which will include four dedicated netball courts as well as seven multi-sports courts plus community spaces, will transform the Mowbray area. We are also progressing the Silverdome redevelopment and the UTAS Stadium redevelopment in Launceston, both of which are going to be awesome.

One thing that's become very clear to me since I became a member of this place is the enormous community benefits generated by what are modest grants under the Active Tasmania Infrastructure grants program. I'm extremely proud to have played a role in delivering such a grant to the Lilydale Football Club to name one to upgrade their change room for what was basically an old barn into a modern fit for purpose facility and I commend Rodney Lockett and his amazing team, the Demons, for their amazing work on that. It's a massive upgrade, benefiting the young Tasmanians from all over the north who will play footy there. Their hard work securing grant funding and then delivering the project was amazing to watch. I'd like to take a moment to also recognise all the community members who volunteer their time, energy and expertise to make their communities better places to live and play. This budget has made $5 million available under that program.

For those wondering about this government's capacity to deliver major projects and who have yet to drive over the magnificent Bridgewater Bridge, stage 1 of the Launceston General Hospital redevelopment is about complete. The multistorey car park will be completed during 2026-27. Funding of $634.7 million for stage 2 of the LGH redevelopment is flowing over the next 10 years. That redevelopment will see a doubling of the size of the emergency department and feature a new purpose-built mental health precinct. Construction begins next year on the 16-bed Northern Heart Centre at LGH with federal funding.

Still in health, $20 million in federal funding has also been secured for the Launceston Hospice in South Launceston and this government has allocated $10 million for the new Kings Meadows Community Centre in Launceston.

It would be fair to say that Tasmanians are more than a little interested in our road network and getting out into our awesome natural environment. That's very true of my constituents in Bass. It gives me great pleasure to note that this interim budget funds safety and efficiency upgrades to that crucial transport link in our north-east, Bridport Road. Illawarra and Bridport Main Roads are also of strategic importance, and they will both see funding in this budget, too. Those safety and efficiency upgrades to the East and West Tamar highways will continue along with progressing the Launceston and Tamar Valley traffic vision, including planning for the new Tamar crossing. Visitors to the Tamar Valley Wetlands will soon have enhanced visitors' experience as the boardwalk is replaced. This government is also delivering upgrades to Flinders Island campground facilities along with improved access for increasingly popular recreational vehicles.

To claim this government is failing to deliver programs and infrastructure that are to the benefit of all Tasmanians is misleading to say the very least. Since 2014, Liberal governments have transformed Tasmania overwhelmingly for the better. We know there is always going to be more to do, and Tasmanians know that we won't shirk the responsibility of taking the necessary steps to return to a modest budget surplus over forward Estimates. If the budget was a real issue that saw Labor blow up the previous parliament, sending us to another election, then it's very clear now that Tasmanians support this Rockliff Liberal government to get it back on track without wrecking the joint. That is our plan.

Speaker, I commend this appropriation bill to the House.

[5.43 p.m.]
Mr Di FALCO (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise today to discuss the 2025-26 Tasmanian budget and to outline both the opportunities it presents and the real concerns that our community expects us to confront honestly. Budgets shape priorities and they reveal what government truly values. Our responsibility is to examine these decisions carefully and to speak for the people in the community. I understand the Treasurer called this an interim budget and the Treasury was on a tight deadline to produce it as this has been an interesting year in politics. I reviewed the budget with that in mind. However, I have high expectations for May.

In my short time in parliament, I've met extremely capable people in the public service, private sector and community organisations. I haven't come across many programs I wouldn't fund myself. As I've consistently stated, we must build wealth in our state and generate more revenue to fund essential services. This sounds like a simple idea: make more money, spend it wisely. If it was that easy, our state wouldn't be in the situation it is today. I have had a crash course in economics over the previous three months and read more finance graphs than I care to acknowledge.

The Budget contains some welcome investments. It strengthens elements of health, education and community services. It includes initiatives that, if delivered well, will make a difference to our regions. I acknowledge this upfront because Tasmanians deserve support in difficult times. However, it is also true that a budget can be promising in some areas, while still failing to meet the moment in others. The people of Tasmania expect us to scrutinise not simply applaud. Today, I want to speak plainly about where the risks lie, where the gaps remain and where the government must do better.

First, the budget places heavy reliance on broad savings measures inside the State Service. These savings come in the form of recruitment freezes and efficiency targets across multiple departments. There is nothing wrong with demanding value for money, but when savings are imposed without clear protection for frontline services, communities feel the impact. Families in my electorate rely on consistent access to healthcare, school support, community outreach, and local service officers. These are not optional extras, they are essential pillars of social stability. When the staffing pauses become too wide or too blunt, the result is slower response times, growing waiting lists and more pressure on people who are already stretched. I urge the government to ensure that any internal savings never compromise frontline care in rural towns or in our outer suburbs where the need is greatest. We need an increase in in community services to allow patients to be treated in their own homes to lessen the burden on our hospitals. We also need an increase in community nursing services statewide.

The second concern relates to the growth of government administration. In several areas, the Budget increases the size or cost of internal operations, coordination units, and central programs. Again, the investment capability is sometimes necessary, but the public expects this parliament to place community outcomes ahead of expanding bureaucracy. When families are struggling with rent, when older Tasmanians are choosing between heating and groceries, and when small businesses are managing rising overheads, it is reasonable to ask why internal government spending is rising faster than the investment in practical supports.

Another area where the government is yet to strike the right balance is energy. This budget continues to support large-scale renewable projects. I want to be clear that I support a strong energy future for Tasmania. I support innovation and the opportunities that come with it, but we cannot ignore farmers, small landowners and rural communities who feel they are being asked to absorb the impact of wind and solar expansion without the protections they deserve. The heavy footprint of new transmission corridors has created anxiety for many people who simply want fairness and respect. Hydro remains our most reliable and community compatible energy asset. Future investment must place property rights, agricultural protection, and rural amenity at the centre of planning. This budget does not yet reflect that strongly enough.

One of the most pressing issues facing Tasmania is housing. I acknowledge that the Budget invests additional funding into social and affordable housing. This is sensible and it is welcome, but the scale of the crisis demands more urgency. Older Tasmanians are facing the terrifying prospect of homelessness for the first time in their lives. Families are struggling in private rental markets that are stretched beyond capacity. Community organisations tell me that emergency accommodation is full and that the system is buckling. We cannot solve this with slow builds or long-term announcements. We need rapid construction, better planning, and improved partnerships with community housing providers. The funding in this budget is a start, but it does not yet match the scale of the need. Neighbourhood Houses serve a vital role in the community. I had the pleasure of visiting Okines Community House a few weeks ago and saw firsthand the work that they do. We must invest further in these services. They deal with the most vulnerable within our community and if there isn't additional funding available, we must streamline their allocation funding. Delays are unacceptable.

Another concern is the lack of additional funding for Inland Fisheries, which has been modestly funded for years to essentially maintain the status quo. Our fishing industry should be well regarded. It requires low amounts of investment by the government and equates to over $270 million to the economy.

I acknowledge that crafting a budget is never easy. There are competing priorities, finite resources, constant demand. My criticisms today are made in good faith. I want to see a budget that strengthens Tasmania's social fabric, protects our rural communities, and builds an economy that supports small business and working families. I want to see a budget that respects landowners, accelerates housing, and ensures that frontline services never pay the price for internal savings. These are reasonable expectations and they reflect what Tasmanians tell me every day. As I stated earlier, I have high expectations for May's budget and the Treasurer's commitment to curtail spending and prioritise services that Tasmanians rely on. Thank you.

[5.52 p.m.]
Mr GEORGE (Franklin) - Thank you, honourable Speaker, and for your patience. I've been reporting budgets in various jurisdictions since the 1970s and no matter what the political persuasion of the treasurer and of the government, one thing never changes: every single one of them blames someone else for their slash-and-burn budget. Meanwhile, every single one of them also claims all the credit for a spend as if there's no tomorrow budget. This Treasurer is no different. This government is no different. It is everyone else's fault. The easiest villain for a Liberal minority government is a federal Labor government.

Last week's mini budget was a 'hold your breath,' if not quite a 'hold your nose,' budget, as we wait for the slash-and-burn in May, when no doubt the Treasurer will discover that everyone else is still to blame for the black hole this government has dropped us into. Where does the blame really lie? Let's start with the joyous electioneering that both Liberal and Labor love to indulge in, making big spending promises that have no budgetary sustainability. According to economist Saul Eslake, in the last election, but one each promised $2 billion in spending. It isn't working and the electorate is waking up. Liberal and Labor votes are on an irreversible downward trajectory because fewer Tasmanians believe their hollow promises. Next May we expect to slash and burn because the Treasurer is out of ideas. His government is so corporatised that it dares not upset the top end of town that hates to pay more from their profits to the public purse.

The Treasurer reckons people know better than the government how to spend their money. The 'people' he refers to are, for instance, the salmon barons, who pay a pittance for exploiting our waters, while exporting their profits. Why else would the Treasurer simply refuse to even contemplate raising more than the pittance of $1.2 million annually for the free use of our waterways? Let's not upset the salmon barons. It's the same with mining and forestry. Let's not upset the bosses by making them pay fair return for the extraction of our - the public's - natural resources. In May's horror budget it will all be someone else's fault. No lesson will be learned when the next election approaches and the big spending, the big promises, will return to haunt us.

'We're performing well,' said the Premier. Well, tell that to struggling community services, it will be news to them. The decisions, or lack of them, in this budget have a massive impact on the life, the health, and the services that are delivered to our regional communities. The Treasurer has publicly warned us that this is the first of at least two ever-increasing waves of budget cuts. We've been told to get used to making choices about where we spend our money, but we are not the problem Treasurer, you are. Households are already on tight enough budgets and cutting costs. My office is bombarded with emails from concerned CEOs, community organisations, and members of the public looking down the barrel of your budget. The seven Neighbourhood Houses in my electorate, Franklin, are seriously expecting to cut staff and services and fearful of their safety with minimal staff available. Even the same amount in this mini budget actually amounts to cost cuts. Operating cost price rises, excessive reporting requirements, mounting administration costs, requirements for submissions, confusing funding agreements, all amounts to less money for frontline work as running costs soar.

Treasurer, frontline organisations like this are exhausted, fearful, underfunded and frankly underappreciated. Your government promised last year to reduce red tape for community service organisations. For most, that is a promise broken. If you won't properly fund them, at least ensure their funding arrangements are simplified. Community houses work their way through a bureaucratic labyrinth of government agencies that don't talk to each other, have conflicting reporting arrangements, multiple deeds for core or specific programs, and each work to different timeframes. This undermines the work of supporting an increasing number of Tasmanians struggling with daily life, lack of housing, poor health, cost of living, mental health issues, all of which are leading to the worst outcomes in the nation. Treasurer, if you won't give these organisations more resources, at least give them some mercy. Remember, Treasurer, that the community sector is an investment in the future, delivering programs, services, primary health, and early intervention that ease your budget woes by saving you money.

Before you leap into cutting public servants by at least 2800 people, will you consider what extra burden this puts on the community services that will be expected to take up the slack? The Treasurer bleats about unaffordable wage demands from the public sector. I would much rather see public sector wages rise to attract and retain the best and stem the exodus of our workforce to other states. I urge the Treasurer to dispose of his voodoo economics and invest in the human capital of our state instead of throwing billions into the stadium folly with its resulting interest and loan repayments amounting to a $2 billion debt.

Turning to Labor sitting on its hands. Where are Labor's ideas? Where is the hope on the horizon of a genuine opposition that has something to offer? What are they waiting for? What would Bob or Gough or even Jim Bacon think of this lack of ambition, the vacuum of ideas? They could have been on the Treasury benches today if they hadn't been so incompetent in negotiating with a willing, open-minded crossbench quite prepared to help end an administration that struggles with the notion of competent government.

Labor reckons it's out there listening. Have they not heard enough from Franklin and the other electorates after 11 and a half years in opposition? Have they been somehow listening, but not hearing? Community has been the foundation of Labor in the past and Neighbourhood Houses a flagship. Labor appears out of ideas missing in action. Neighbourhood Houses Tasmania, the peak body that supports the 34 houses across the state, seven in my electorate, is hanging on, hoping desperately for a May budget but at least allows them to maintain existing programs, and hope is all they have.

According to Anglicare, as my colleague Prof Razay mentioned, in the past few months alone there has been a 34 per cent increase in people in need of housing support, an 88 per cent rise in people sleeping rough, a 54 per cent increase in people living in substandard dwellings - Tasmanians without running water, bathrooms or kitchens. By 2032, when this government somewhat unbelievably considers that it will have built 10,000 new homes, Anglicare reckons there will be 14,000 Tasmanians waiting for affordable housing support, getting on for treble today's number.

This, then, is a government that should bow its head in shame. It's worth labouring the point for a government that has clearly lost focus on our state's most vulnerable. In case the Treasurer has forgotten or never known, let me remind the House about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 25, paragraph one, 'Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care.' I repeat, the government should hang its head in shame.

In this House, I've already expressed my concerns that the government's first home buyer subsidy of $30,000 would push prices up despite its good intentions. I repeat that concern today. Coupled with increased demand for social housing, Hobart has been hit with further increases to the cost of homes, with median home prices rising by 3.1 per cent to $665,000, and houses in my electorate, Franklin, up by 15 per cent. Housing and safe homes have the knock-on effect of improving other areas of life, including health, education, reduced crime rates, reduced mental health issues, and greater human happiness. These cannot be approached in the government's piecemeal way, and yet yield better results.

We are entering, I'm afraid, a class system where only the educated, the wealthy and the top end of town that are heard. This is my fear; that the decisions the government is making will not help those who need help, but will reward those who are already safe, already housed, already fed and already employed.

Why are we where we are, in what the Treasury clearly sees as the edge of a precipice, and wants every fiscal lever pulled? Because the government doesn't listen. The Treasurer talks of this government as being one of consultation, and includes the multi-partisan budget panel that Labor will not engage with. Let me tell you, my crossbench colleagues and I approach this panel with great dollops of scepticism. This government has a track record. It is habituated to making decisions, then calling for public submissions, then commissioning expensive investigations, inquiries, reviews and reports, and then doing exactly what it bloody well wants. Except for the commission of inquiry, there is a long, unbroken track record of faux consultation, instigated by closed minds.

I am prepared to give the Treasurer one more opportunity to genuinely consult across the floor of this parliament. One more chance. I encourage Labor to join this panel in one last effort to produce a far, far better outcome for Tasmanians than this mini budget projects. I encourage the Treasurer to reach out to people like Legislative Councillor Ruth Forrest, who has insights that seem beyond this administration's imagining. Reach out, in fact, to anyone with fresh ideas.

If the Treasurer is planning a horror budget for May, then he needs to be held to account by every member of this place, contributing towards an outcome that places Tasmania's most vulnerable as our highest priority; an outcome that ensures the top end of town pays its own way. An outcome that squanders not one red cent on a stadium we don't need, don't want and cannot afford. An outcome that invests in Tasmania's future and Tasmanian lives.

Statement by Speaker


[6.04 p.m.]
The SPEAKER - I want to make a comment to the House in reference to Mindframe guidelines. While one of the most important principles of parliamentary debate in this Chamber is the freedom of speech, members must be mindful of how they use this freedom, especially when it comes to raising matters that may trigger trauma for people who are listening to the broadcast or reading the Hansard. I take this opportunity to remind members that under Mindframe guidelines, it is not appropriate to comment or speculate on the specific circumstances for suicide. As you could expect, any discussion of this topic can bring up issues, so I remind those present and those that may be listening that if this discussion has triggered any issues for you, then please reach out for assistance through Lifeline Australia on 13 11 14. 

This is not in regard to your speech, by the way, Mr George, this is just in regard to another circumstance that happened today. I appreciate greatly that members may not be aware of the Mindframe guidelines, so all members will soon be invited to a briefing on them, which I encourage all members to attend so they're more aware of what is appropriate to say in this parliament and to be conscious at all times that many Tasmanians are watching our broadcasts and listening. 
———————————————————
[6.05 p.m.]
Ms BROWN - Honourable Speaker, I rise today to respond to the 2025-26 state interim Budget handed down by Treasurer Abetz last week. Let me say from the outset, that this isn't a budget for the everyday Tasmanian. This is a budget built on spin and slogans rather than substance and compassion. It is a budget of deeper debt, broken promises and tragically, it's missing heart.

In my portfolios of housing, prevention of family and sexual violence, heritage and arts, the story is one of neglect, delay and denial. The government talks about delivering outcomes, but what it's actually delivering is disappointment. I've listened to many of those opposite repeat figures and percentages like they're achievements, but I wonder if any of them have actually stopped to think about the people behind these figures - the Tasmanians who are struggling and hoping for more, because you wouldn't know it by the way that they're speaking about it. This government is addicted to announcements and allergic to accountability.

I want to spend my time today talking about the people of this community, the Tasmanians that this government has left behind in this budget. These are letters that I have written to the minister for Housing. The first constituent that I want to highlight is somebody that is sleeping in their car every night and has prolonged homelessness that has inflicted their life and their physical and mental wellbeing.

Another person is a mother to a young child who is living in a private rental who has been taken off the housing wait list, and she can't afford the private rental that she's in. She has sold all of her belongings to pay for that rental and has now been put in rent arrears and will soon lose that house and will be living in her car with her young child. Another constituent of mine is a mother with two daughters with anxiety and ADHD. The mother themselves has complex PTSD and trauma through family violence. She has been on the housing wait list for a number of years and is yet to be offered an appropriate home.

Another constituent of mine is somebody that was living in a home for 20 years and that home was then sold from underneath her. She's now couch surfing. This person has suffered three strokes and, as a result, has partial sight loss, and needs a stable home to recover in. I have another constituent who has raised with me the issues of maintenance, lifting floorboards, carpeted areas with no underlay, windows and doors that no longer seal, so keeping their house warm is almost impossible. Another constituent of mine has been on the housing wait list for over two years. She is in a private rental where she suffered a sexual assault in and has no choice but to stay in that rental for her children's sake. 

These are not just statistics that we are hearing about. These are real Tasmanians with real lives, and this budget has let them down. It has let down Tasmanians enduring trauma at the homes that they're in. It has let down Tasmanians sleeping in cars. It has let down Tasmanians couch surfing with nowhere to go.

When people are housed and they're safe and secure, everything changes. Children start attending school again. Parents can seek and keep employment. Families find stability and start to rebuild their lives and rebuild their confidence, and communities grow stronger. Safe homes are not just shelter; they transform lives, and year after year this government has failed to act with the urgency that is needed.

Now I see from those opposite boasting that they're on track to meet the social housing targets, but let's be honest, that claim is as hollow as their promises. They've padded the numbers with vacant blocks of land and existing private rentals, conveniently ignoring what Tasmanians actually need, which is long-term affordable housing. According to Anglicare, long-term housing remains the most commonly-identified need. Two out of three Tasmanians seeking support still can't get this. Shelter Tasmania has said it plainly: people are struggling. Women and children escaping family and sexual violence remained some of the most at-risk. When shelters are turning away 9 out 10 women who come to their door desperately seeking help, how can anyone on that side of the Chamber claim that this government is doing enough? This isn't just a statistic; this is alarming and shameful. This isn't a record that that side should be proud of. It is a record of missed opportunities, complacency and neglect.

I want to express my sincere frustration and disappointment that the Treasurer has missed the gender budget in his very first attempt. Did he forget? Because I sure didn't. The fact that it's not there is not just an oversight; it shows what this Treasurer and this government is really about, and it's not protecting women, it's not lifting up women, that's for sure. By ignoring the gender budget statement, this Treasurer has made it abundantly clear that women and girls are an afterthought. That is what is most disturbing - that not a single one on that side has actually mentioned this; not the minister, not the former minister has mentioned this.

How can we possibly talk about fair and equal Tasmania when the government cannot even commit to a gender budget? This budget is more than just paper. It is a moral document; a reflection of what we value, and a reflection of who we forget. In this budget, the government has forgotten too many Tasmanians. It has forgotten people who can't find a home; it has forgotten people that are choosing between food and heating; it has forgotten young artists that are leaving the state because they can't find the opportunities here; it has forgotten the women that are standing on the doorstep of the shelters that do not have room for them.

That is the reality that this budget ignores. On this side of the House, we will not let Tasmanians be forgotten. We will hold this government accountable for every broken promise, every empty announcement, every letter that has the Premier's signature on it, only to be ripped up. We will be standing up for Tasmanians. We stand with workers, with families, with our communities. That is not just our policy; that is who we are. On this side, it is in our DNA to lift up Tasmanians to fight for fairness and to put people before politics; and that is what this government has forgotten.

[6.14 p.m.]
Mr VERMEY (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, as you're aware, I have run three times to gain my wonderful seat in the electorate of Clark, and I am now representing my constituents. Over those years, I've watched, with pride, our Liberal government do everything they can to help push Tasmania forward, support the most vulnerable, and to do their utmost to ensure our business thrives and our future is secure. I'm privileged to endorse this interim budget today, and again, I'm proud to be part of this cohesive, strong, stable, forward-thinking Liberal government.

As my colleagues before me have pointed out, the honourable Eric Abetz and his Treasury team have done what I believe is an outstanding job at short notice delivering our interim budget, given the pressure due to the disastrous efforts of the opposition in a failed power grab, calling a no confidence election. We stand for the people and everything that it encompasses: the vulnerable, the elderly, the entrepreneurs, our farmers, our magnificent small business people, public servants, and those like myself - proud small business owners delivering the best services and quality Tasmanian products to fellow Tasmanians. We also stand for our veterans, past and present. I must say it was an honour and privilege to see them represented with such honour yesterday on a significant day.

In this budget, it continues to commit to our investing in what matters: constructing new dedicated mental health precincts in Burnie, Devonport, Launceston, and Hobart with new patient units and rehabilitation services; tripling our first homeowner grants to $30,000, helping more Tasmanians get into their home and stimulating the construction industry; continuing to provide cost-of-living relief to families, including healthy school lunches, breakfasts, and vouchers to encourage physical activity; undertaking upgrades at our state public hospitals and continuing putting in $10 million a day into our healthcare; stamping out stamp duty for first home buyers of existing homes up to $750,000; progressing our bold vision to cut red tape and make Tasmania the start-up capital of the nation; investing into schools, the education facilities, with $298 million; putting money into STEM, forward focusing, looking for a modern education fit-for-purpose with $2.4 billion into the education sector; delivering concessions across rates, energy, transport, and water to give relief to the home budget; keeping Tasmanians safe by giving police the tools and powers they need, including trialling tasers and knife-detection wands.

In my electorate of Clark, the following commitments demonstrate our government's passion to meet what we need. In education, we're putting $2.3 million into redevelopment into Hobart City High, both the Ogilvie and New Town campuses; we are revitalising Cosgrove High School with a $24.9 million redevelopment; providing new and refurbished learning facilities; expanding the delivery of the School Lunch Program across northern schools, a new free universal school breakfast program for all Tasmanian schools; funding to upgrade playgrounds, sports courts at Tasmanian state schools, including Claremont High and Moonah Primary School.

In health, we're putting $10 million into the completion of two new eating disorder clinics, one at St Johns Park; funding to deliver 27 new mental health beds in southern Tasmania, with 15 at St Johns Park and 12 at the Peacock Centre; more than $2 million in funding for the refurbishment of the theatre complex at the Royal Hobart Hospital to house a new cardio angiogram machine; continuing the Royal Hobart Hospital redevelopment plan with expansion of Stage 2 as part of the 30-year masterplan, including lift replacements, refurbishments, and second stage of the expansion of the emergency department; $3 million in grant funding to Calvary Lenah Valley Hospital to support expansion of the maternity services, and capital funding to deliver a new diagnosis breast clinic to be collocated with Breast Screen Tasmania; nearly $20 million to complete the Royal Hobart Hospital's new purpose-built pharmacy redevelopment to be completed by the end of 2026; funding for the new Royal Hobart Hospital Mental Health Short Stay unit; $70 million over four years to develop 40 beds at St Johns health park precinct, an older person's mental health facility as stage 2 at the St Johns precinct.

In community, we're delivering: $7.6 million enhanced visitor amenities at the Royal Hobart Botanical Gardens, along with $500,000 for upgrades to the conservatory and historic Eardley-Wilmot Wall; the Neighbourhood Houses Community Connector program; funding support for Hamlet, to provide training and work-readiness skills to people facing barriers in employment. I commend Emily. I've known her for a long time, and she is doing a great job there; funding for the Troublesmiths program to support highly disadvantaged young people to assist with engagement with employment; $12.5 million to the New Town Bay project, part of the Phoenix Basketball Club; $28 million towards developing Glenorchy Sports Centre with a four-court facility at Claremont College; and $5 million made available for community sporting clubs through the Active Tasmania Infrastructure grants.

Our roads, we're looking after that as well. We're putting $4 million - and part of that is around about $650 million - but we're putting $4 million into the Brooker Highway upgrades; over $300 million into the Greater Hobart Traffic Solution; $180 million to the southern region state upgrades; and $187 million to the Urban Congestion Fund, including $75 million for the Northern Access Road for Port and Hobart Macquarie precincts.

The stadium, the entertainment precinct will deliver things that we can't even picture now - it's visionary. It will increase confidence. It'll bring people with new ideas. We will have a high-performance training centre at Kingborough, injecting into Franklin employment, housing and supporting young people. The AFL will also be going right around the state into other sporting communities and encouraging people to be active and be healthy.

The tourism that flows from these sorts of things, like the entertainment precinct, injects $4.5 billion into our economy, providing over 50,000 jobs, and we want that to keep growing. Tourism is one of our biggest sectors and to bring people we have to have things that are new, inviting and encouraging.

Ms Ogilvie - Entertaining as well. 

Mr VERMEY - Absolutely, we need the entertainment. I echo the Premier's statements, The future of our state is bright, and this budget is building Tasmania now and for our future, to make our great state the best place to live, work, invest, do business, and raise a family. I congratulate the Treasurer, and I proudly endorse this interim Budget today. 

[6.24 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, it is a huge responsibility to deliver a budget for a government. Tonight, I wish to use this budget reply to paint a picture of what this budget lacks, point to missed opportunities and elaborate on what a budget should provide and for whom. I'd like to acknowledge the contributions of many in this Chamber over the last couple of days who have spoken out for the welfare of their community and their environment.

The role of government is to spend public monies wisely. It is to serve the community's interests. It is not to pander to vested interests, such as big salmon. It is to have the vision, and insight, to invest wisely for all of us to prosper, not at the expense of the environment, nor of deserving and needing Tasmanians, like children catching buses to get to schools which aren't running.

It is a chance to see where mistakes may have been made and correct the course, but it's hard to see where this government learns from its mistakes. This is a budget that prioritises a Macquarie Point stadium over delivering much-needed services and infrastructure that should be prioritised for the benefit of all Tasmanians.

The Treasurer has had time to change course from the disaster of the May budget that was not delivered, but leading commentators say that there has been no budget repair in this interim budget after the previous Treasurer failed to deliver for Tasmanians. Deloitte Access Economics' Cedric Hodges said Tasmania's increases in debt needed to be arrested soon. I quote: 

As that debt accumulates, so do the interest payments, and the interest payments are money that we spend every year that don't create a single job, and they don't provide a single hospital bed. They don't educate a single Tasmanian. [tbc]

Economist Saul Eslake, whose advice the government apparently loves to ignore, says:

I think they've missed an opportunity to make an early start on doing things they're going to have to do eventually in order to put the budget on a more sustainable footing. [tbc]

Tasmania's economic position, according to Mr Eslake, was the worst of any state or territory when two key budget measures were looked at. Mr Eslake said the debt was larger, as a percentage of its gross state product, than that of any other jurisdiction. That's debt carried by the GBEs, such as Hydro Tasmania, TasNetworks, and TT-Line, of which we've heard a lot. 

I reference the Auditor-General's report as well with that claim of likely insolvency, and Tasmania's unfunded superannuation liability. These are projected to rise from $22.8 billion this financial year to $28.5 billion in 2028-29. He also points out that returns to government through GBE profits, at least in the near term, are going to be smaller than foreshadowed in previous budgets. This is very worrying indeed. It should not be brushed off as of little or no concern, as the Treasurer and the Premier would have you believe.

It is telling to listen carefully to a budget speech and to listen out for those hidden details, rather than what the Treasurer wants us to hear. The Treasurer's Budget Speech was a bravado performance which might have convinced the casual listener that the Tasmanian economy is pure symphony. The spotlight now needs to be on those notes he did not play.

The Treasurer may speak aspirationally of an $8 billion surplus in forward Estimates, but it skips over the millions of dollars of cuts to vital community and public services. How will that gap be filled?

There are a number of concerns the Greens have raised about the likely drain the Macquarie Point stadium will be on Tasmanians across generations to service unwanted debt, but what of capital spending, Treasurer? How do you intend to rein that in?

When defending the massive expenditure and debt that the Macquarie Point stadium will inevitably incur, the Treasurer continually suggests, rather patronisingly I might add, that operational and capital expenditure are not connected. They are two different pots of money with no relation to each other. They seem like endless pots of gold for the Treasurer - but try telling that to 2800 workers whose public service positions are marked for cuts, almost 10 per cent of the public sector .Tell that to the unions, and those workers who went out rallying right across the state, and those who represent our public sector workers.

The Treasurer may speak of natural attrition that will reduce public servants, but he fails to reveal the calculation of just how that might occur. It is a modest operational surplus that the Treasurer aspires to in 2028-29 through the EPU efficiencies and cuts to Tasmanians in public service jobs. Does he realise that Tasmania's needs are greater than other jurisdictions when it comes to the public sector to population ratio, with a very dispersed population and higher reliance on social service and welfare payments? Our community needs a functioning public sector amid our food shortages, and we know that uni students at UTAS at Sandy Bay are finding it very difficult, as are many pensioners and people who we speak to in our electorate offices. 

There are others who are working two jobs to pay for power bills and stretch their food and make ends meet. This is a biting cost of living. Housing and transport stress is occurring from unfortunately poor population and regional planning. It has a long-term outcome, and it's a poor outcome for our state. 2800 public sector workers' jobs are a lot to shed, and vacancy control is a false economy, let me tell you. I'll paint you a picture of how it works on the ground, and this can play out in many public sector organisations going through the pain of vacancy control, which ultimately leads to job cuts. I'll paint you a picture of what I faced as a manager in the Health Department.

I had a small team of health professionals and there were vacancy controls, so we couldn't fill vacancies in frontline positions, but also support positions. What that means in day-to-day activities is that those patients who can't be seen will ultimately gain more problems. In this case, it might be foot ulcers, it might be complications associated with diabetes. When they can't get seen by an outpatient podiatrist, they may need to go to the Emergency Department, or go and seek their general practitioner or a nurse practitioner to help stave the gap before they can have further treatment. In the worst case scenario, there can be surgical interventions, such as amputations, so this is pretty serious to people's health and wellbeing. 

For staff who are there, it takes longer for those patients to be seen because their complications and comorbidities become greater and it's much more difficult in the long term. By stopping positions being filled, you have knock-on effects, and you have knock-on effects for staff because you have burnout for staff - this is what the unions have been telling us - you have burnout for managers. It's a farce. It's just a waste of time to always go to HR for finding out whether you can get through vacancy control. It is a false economy, and it is not serving Tasmanians well.

This is a similar story we're hearing again in our offices from many employees across government agencies. Jobs aren't being filled, managers are juggling staff, and there is often burnout and work stress. That's not a way to treat public servants. It has knock-on effects for private sector as well, certainly in the case of podiatrists, because it's very hard to get podiatrists to come down to work in Tasmania.

Not only are there concerns about the impact on public sector workers, but there are also concerns of the lack of prioritisation the government seems to bring to their infrastructure projects

We have six months before the next budget, Treasurer, and I request that the multi-partisan budget panel consider a list of the major infrastructure projects and hear the government's plan to either deliver or shelve them, and over what timeframe they are to be considered. That way the panel can understand - and Mr Bayley talked about the benefits of the panel: fiscal literacy and an improved knowledge of how the government works. Having a chance to look at those governments infrastructure priorities would be of benefit for that for that panel to hear. I ask the Treasurer if he would take this request on notice. There is much work to be done to repair the austerity that will not improve without our interventions, such as using taxes wisely, including royalties on salmon companies.

The Greens have an enduring place in this parliament, as part of Tasmania's history and of the Tasmanian landscape. We are here to continue to remind and encourage the government that there are always way to be kind, compassionate and fair.

As a state, we should be working towards better state of the environment outcomes. Better strategic planning upfront, which we're sadly lacking; smarter transport outcomes rather than urban growth pushing into valuable agricultural land or land that has important ecological values.

One of the key recommendations from the State of the Environment Report was to review Tasmania's resource management and planning system, to ensure they are contemporary, effective, and aligns with the UN's Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Global Biodiversity Framework. The commission recommended a review of the Land Use and Planning Approvals, Environmental Management and Pollution Control and the State Policies and Projects acts. We could be heading into an era where our planning system helps us to protect and preserve the environment and critical biodiversity; provide much needed housing and transport solutions; and create liveable, vibrant communities. Instead, with this budget, the Treasurer is simply ushering us into the era of stadium austerity.

When we talk transport services, which is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, this presents an easy win for remediation. The State of the Environment recommendation 15, is about air quality monitoring and emissions reduction across all sectors. This recommendation discusses the government's existing emissions reductions and resilience plans, including transport. Given the budget for the climate change output is reducing from $9 million this year, to two $2 million a year over the forward Estimates: how is the government going to implement meaningful emissions reductions across all sectors of the Tasmanian economy and government?

One obvious solution to reduce emissions is in how we plan and build housing. If we pilot housing solutions along transit corridors such as the Hobart to Glenorchy pilot in the northern suburbs of Hobart, by building multi-residential developments and housing along the corridor in poorly utilised land, which is being championed by people such as the Planning Institute, the Glenorchy and Hobart councils are on board, and the Committee for Greater Hobart would love to see this as well - they're doing a fantastic job in advocating in this space. There is a chance to deliver medium-density housing close to transport and services, without encroaching on the urban fringes. Why, then, is the Abetz budget silent on a win-win for housing solutions?

In summary, there are fundamental questions here. Does this budget deliver for Tasmanian social health and wellbeing? Does it deliver for people with Neighbourhood Houses in West Moonah, Chigwell, including the Chigwell Community Garden and Goodwood? Does it help with active transport health and wellbeing outcomes through better urban design with cleaner air through better transport efficiencies and better transport options for general mobility of all in our community, including younger and older Tasmanians alike. It clearly does not. It delivers continued uncertainty for social wellbeing. It undermines the valuable role of the public service.

Does this government deliver for the environment? No. No funding for the State of the Environment report's recommendations which suggest the environment, such as our waterways and urban fringes and transport emissions, are losing out.

The Treasurer's interim Budget is just that, a stopgap. Another missed opportunity and, unfortunately, Tasmanians will suffer both in the short and the long term because of so many ill-considered responses. It's another sticking plaster attempting to cover up the deep scars left by a slash-and-burn agenda and a reckless attempt to avoid responsibility.

[6.41 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Treasurer) - Honourable Speaker, I thank all the people that have made the contributions to this budget debate. Having sent the parliament to an early election on the premise of the need for budget repair, I must say I was personally disappointed - and I think the people of Tasmania will be similarly disappointed - that in all the contributions that were made, there was no actual talk of the need for budget repair. On the one hand we were told we need budget repair, but then we want expenditure, expenditure, expenditure. We have some of the unrealistic savings from the Greens and I will get on to them.

Dr Woodruff - You weren't in the room, to be fair.

Mr ABETZ - I listened to what you had to say elsewhere.

That said, can I say, especially in relation to Labor's response, it was weak, it was wooden. There was nothing in it. There was the gratuitous personal attack on me. Good luck to the Leader of the Opposition, but if he thinks that is part and parcel of obtaining budget repair, so be it, but I don't think the people of Tasmania will be impressed by that as a substitute for budget repair. We were told by Labor that they would think - now there's an oxymoron for you, Labor and thinking - but what's more they were willing to say Labor would outthink us. They would outthink us, but nothing in any of the speeches suggested that any thought had gone into their contribution other than from the play piece that they used in the last parliament, at the last election, which resulted in a decrease in their vote.

It wasn't a convincing proposition that our friends from the Labor Party put to the people of Tasmania. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition said when this government stumbles and falls, they will be ready. In other words, they have no vision or ambition in themselves or of themselves to try to gain government with positive policies or a different approach. They're just sitting back, twiddling their thumbs, hoping that we might stumble. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, that is not on our agenda and we will continue to be an active government.

I could not help but contemplate the comments of the Leader of the Opposition when he said that this government is one that had 'run out of puff,' as he read his speech so very tediously. It was as though the opposition had run out of puff and then, up came the Premier with an animated, convincing defence of the Budget and the government and anybody listening in would have been able to do the juxtaposition, the compare and contrast, and see that here is a government that is full of ideas, capable and able to lead the state, whereas Labor is simply sitting back, waiting for stumbles and falls.

I would have thought that, by now, Labor would have learnt the lesson that they cannot simply rely on relentless negativity to achieve their desire to be a government. When your primary vote slips below 30 per cent, there might be a reason to ask or self-reflect as to whether there is actually a need for a clear alternative. None was presented.

Let me move on to some of the issues that have been raised and nearly everybody from those opposite wanted increased spending. We were told the public service was already stretched to its limits, then we are also told we need budget repair. So, if you don't right-size the public service, which roughly takes up 50 per cent of the budget, where are you going to make savings sufficient to get the budget back into balance? Keep in mind that, just a few short months ago, we were sent to the people because the budget needed repairing. That was the assertion by those opposite. Fine, I would have thought they would then be duty bound to come into this place and present their alternative or their suggestion as to how we might be able to get the budget back into balance.

Also disappointing was the fact that Labor - sure, still under federal administration - were not willing to acknowledge the need for the federal government in Canberra to step up to the mark. When I, during Question Time, twice now outlined the fact that we have 100 people who, unfortunately, are called bed-blockers, that's the term that I understand is used, because they cannot get an aged-care facility placement or a disability care placement. That is three wards of the hospital being filled by people who are able to be discharged but there is no place for them to go and whose responsibility is aged care? Federal. Whose responsibility is the disability sector? Federal. And what do we have? Not a squeak out of Labor willing to be Tasmanians first, rather than Canberra's voice in Tasmania first. I find that exceptionally disappointing because I would have thought that any party that wants to aspire to government in Tasmania needs to convince, not only by words but also by actions, that they are willing to put the needs of Tasmanians first and what a relief it would be to our health budget if those 100 people were able to be placed into facilities - the responsibility of the Commonwealth.

Negotiations continue in relation to health and I know that the minister, Mrs Archer, is doing a fantastic job, as is our Premier, in the negotiations, and I try to do my little bit on the board of treasurers. What we need, however, is a united Tasmanian voice to call out this shortfall. That those opposite were unable to bring themselves to call that out is, quite frankly, disappointing and devastating to most Tasmanians because what they see from the alternative government or so-called alternative government is an unwillingness to defend Tasmania's needs, to advocate for Tasmania's needs and to ensure that we get a fair deal out of Canberra. If they're not willing to do it on the health issue, heaven help us, when it comes to the renegotiation of the GST distribution that will need to happen in 2028-2029, when the No Worse Off Guarantee expires. What we need -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The honourable Treasurer has the call. There are other forms of this House that you can use. There's another bill and there's also Adjournment.
	
Members interjecting.
	
The SPEAKER - Through the Chair, please.

Mr ABETZ - Labor likes to call those on the crossbench or the protest parties. Well, I'm not sure that that's necessarily a fair moniker for them, but if they're in the business of providing monikers, the Labor Party's is the 'grievance party.' All they do is engage in relentless negativity, telling us how everything is wrong, that we need to pay the public servants more, that we've got to do this, we've got to do that. When I say pay public servants more, of course, I'm talking about above and beyond what is a reasonable offer. The Labor Party, it appears, is so beholden to the union movement they are not willing to call out the 21 per cent plus increase request from the unions that they must know is unsustainable, undeliverable, yet raising false expectations with the workforce, and then seeking to say, 'Oh, somehow, we need to balance the budget.'

I thank those that have made reference to the multi-partisan panel and what I would say to honourable members is that that panel, I think, has been exceptionally informative at the get-go. If I might say, Mr Bayley had a good contribution in that regard, that the multi-purpose panel was not designed to get Greens and others on the sticky paper of supporting the government's budget because that was, and is, the responsibility of the executive of government, which, if I might say, the upper House recently confirmed with the overwhelming defeat of the proposal put forward by Ms Forrest. There is the need for that constitutional division between the parliament, the executive, and indeed, the Legislative Council as a house of review.

Will the panel satisfy everybody? I'm sure it won't, but I would like to think that it has been an effective mechanism to assist all of us to get an understanding. Ms Burnet made a suggestion in relation to infrastructure. We are willing to take that on board. Usually what happens in the panel, without divulging too much, is that at a meeting we determine what we might consider at the next meeting as being an issue. For example, we had the Secretary of the Department of Health before us to give us some insights in relation to the health budget. If that is desired by the panel in relation to the infrastructure budget, we are happy for that to occur as well. As I said to the panel, and as I've said in this place many a time, we are very mindful of the fact we are a minority government and therefore it is only wise, appropriate, whatever term you want to use, for us to listen to the views and opinions of others in this place. Quite often we won't get that which we want, but I don't think, I know, the people of Tasmania want this parliament to work and to work effectively, and that requires collaboration and cooperation. 

Mr Bayley - Treasurer, will you provide the debt servicing figure that you committed to the panel last week? The debt servicing figure on the $375 million borrowings.

Mr ABETZ - Here we go, we will -

The SPEAKER - Order. That is really a question that can now be asked in Estimates as well when we go into a Committee of the Whole House. That is when it is the appropriate time for that. Next week there's a Committee of the Whole House.

Mr ABETZ - Speaker, there was also talk about the possibility of increasing taxes and revenue. As I've said, all these things will be looked at for the purposes of the May Budget. Can I also indicate to the House - if I heard correctly, it was asserted that the salmon sector pays, I believe, $1.6 million into state coffers. They do. They also pay payroll tax not mentioned in the millions of dollars. They also pay a contribution of $10 million per annum for the cost of the public servants that regulate them. All of a sudden, instead of $1 million, we have a multiplicity of tens of millions of dollars.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Sorry to interrupt - well, actually, not sorry to interrupt. The only person who should be speaking right now is the Treasurer. The Treasurer has the call. I remind all members of this House that this is not a time for debate. There are other forms of this House that members can take if they disagree with the Treasurer's comments.

Mr ABETZ - Speaker, let me turn to the favourite topic of the stadium. Everybody seems to want to spend the stadium money in all sorts of ways and as though it can be baked into the budget forever and a day. This is a one-off investment that if it is not put into the stadium, you cut the stadium out - fine, you might be able to use that money for a couple of years. But after the forward Estimates, there won't be another stadium to knock off, so how are you going to fund it?

Also - and this is the very disappointing bit about this matter in this debate - is the suggestion that we don't spend the money on the stadium and we save the money. What that means is that industrial wasteland at Macquarie Point remains a wasteland.

Mr Bayley - You had a development plan. You've contracted developers.

Mr ABETZ - Any development is going to cost public money, and your unwillingness to accept that is unfortunately - I know the intellectual capacity is here to grasp those concepts, but there is not the political will to grasp those concepts. It's not as though you don't build the stadium and you can then put that into public service wages or into health. What would you do with the industrial wasteland that is there? You would still need to spend money. You would still need to spend money on it, and what would that do by way of being an economic enabler? We have a vision.

For over 10 years, there was a view that it should become a car park. Then, the Green proposal - the Eden project. Then, there was a hospital. There have been all sorts of proposals.

Mr Winter - I hate to tell you, Treasurer, but you paid a Victorian developer $3 million not to build homes.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ABETZ - Here we have a proposal that stacks up, will be an economic enabler, and will provide great opportunities. As the budget papers indicate for the 2025-26 Budget, the spending on the stadium: $18.6 million. Hardly going to fund all the things that a lot of members in this place were asserting that they could fund. The following year, it would be $26.6 million out of the Tasmanian funds, and then the following year, it ramps up to $89.3 million. When you look at it in segments over the years as this investment will take place, you realise it's not the windfall that can fund all these things that have been asserted during the debate.

As I was able to say in Question Time, the AFL predicts a payroll of about $44 million. I understand the exact figure on that would not be $2 million as I said at Question Time, but in fact $2.6 million by way of payroll tax each and every year of the AFL team's existence, and so I say we cannot afford not to have the stadium. This is something that will be an economic enabler, it'll be a cultural enabler, it'll be a sporting enabler, and it deserves our support.

Comments were also made that this is a budget that lacks heart. I say to those who engaged in that sort of terminology that there is no heart in spending the next generation's money for our lifestyle today. There's no heart, there's no compassion in that. That is intergenerational theft, and it needs to stop.

As honourable members know, I made those comments in my very first speech in this place. That has been my commitment, my view, and it remains it and the reason is what I have explained.

There are many other matters that I could address. For savings, we have invited our public service to come forward with ideas, with a portal where they can make those suggestions. We've already had over 200. I think the public servants of this state understand the issues that we face and are willing to work with the government to ensure that we can right size the public service, and right size the spending to get our budget back into shape.

Let's be clear, we know what happened with COVID, the three elections thereafter, the payment for the commission of inquiry compensation, et cetera, but the time has now come to adjust or readjust the budget to ensure that we have the savings that are needed.

I turn to Mr Bayley's comment. I'm sure that this was an honest mistake on his part, but he included savings on the Marinus Link equity injection that has already been removed from the interim budget because we renegotiated with the federal government and these negotiations achieved an additional contribution of $346 million from the Commonwealth to the Northwest Transmission Development Project.

There has also been some, dare I say, hyperventilation about the gender budget statement. With the budget that was put down in May, there was a gender budget statement. There was no new material to be put into it and therefore the gender budget statement stands as it was delivered in May.

Similarly, the current interim budget does not deal with the key performance indicator data because as time went by, that was all in the annual reports that were required to be tabled by 31 October.

A lot of the concern and desire to find faults with this budget, can I say with respect, the gender statement remains and all we would have done is, dare I say it to the Greens, we would have chopped down a few more trees to print more documents that would be saying exactly the same thing as it did in May. There was no purpose to redo that document and we are committed to have agenda budget statement along with the May 26 budget.

I simply say that this is a budget that seeks to lay the foundations for future proofing our state to ensure that our budgets are sustainable so that we can service the needs of our fellow Tasmanians in a sustainable manner. 

I conclude, as I started, the disappointment that I personally feel and the government feels that no genuine budget repair propositions were put on the table by the so-called alternate government. I would have thought that, having moved that motion to send us to an election, the need for budget repair, that they would have come in and said, 'Government you are failing. You should be doing A, B, C, D, E'. They did not even get to A. There was not a single recommendation, but we spent time on personal denigration and all sorts of other things rather than dealing with the budget issues.

Mr Bayley - You've got ours to consider though, Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - You're not in the Labor Party and I was addressing my comments -

The SPEAKER - Order. The only one making a contribution is the Treasurer.

Mr ABETZ - to the Labor Party, but if the hat fits, wear it, I would say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - oh, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, there I go - to the Deputy Leader of the Greens, I correct myself. 

Speaker, with that, I commend the budget to the House.

Bill read the second time.


APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 2) 2025 (No. 64)

Second Reading

[7.07 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Treasurer) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the bill be now read the second time.

The second appropriation bill recognises the distinct and essential role of parliament and statutory offices within Tasmania's parliamentary and democratic framework. The bill provides for the appropriation of $58 241 000 out of the Public Account for the financial year ending 30 June 2026. Further detail on the purposes of the appropriation is detailed in part 2 of budget paper No. 2. 

With that, I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, just quickly, I note the appropriation bill and its contents. I want to put on the record the Greens' concerns around the funding allocations in here for the House and the needs of the House. We have seen correspondence from staff in relation to meal allocations and other issues that are being compromised, let's call it, and we know that the expansion of the House has put increased demand on a whole raft of different services in this place.

So, just to put on record our concerns that the House and the business and function of this House is adequately funded. We have our doubts that this appropriation bill actually delivers that and we call on the government, in its May bill, to ensure that the needs of the House and the needs of the members of both Chambers in this place are met through the provision of adequate services for the staff in this place. 

[7.09 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, as we all know, the bill is a second appropriation bill as as outlined by the Treasurer in his second reading speech. Whilst I could spend a long time talking about it and adding things, I will not take up the House's time. I look forward to Estimates next week.

Bill read the second time.


RESIDENTIAL TENANCY AMENDMENT (PETS) BILL 2025 (No. 40)

In Committee - Consideration of Amendments from the Legislative Council

Mr BARNETT - Chair, I move -

That the Council amendments to clause 5 be agreed to.

Mr BARNETT - Chair, the government has agreed to this amendment. It's not something at the top of our list, but we're not going to oppose it. We support getting this bill through, this is the pets in rentals bill. This is an amendment moved by the honourable Meg Webb MLC upstairs, which was passed and agreed upstairs, which is basically providing the fact that it shouldn't be inconsistent or incompatible with a conservation covenant to which the residential premises is subject, or is in the process of being assessed for suitability to become so subject, or a conservation program in respect of the residential premises in which the owner of the residential premises participates, or in which the owner of the residential premises is a member, or in relation to which the owner of the residential premises in the process of being assessed for suitability to participate. There's also a definition of conservation covenant there.

It has been circulated, it's been agreed to in the upper House. As the government, we're quite happy to progress with this bill. It's very important. Providing pets in rentals is something that we believe and we took to the election; we've progressed it now through this House. We're pleased to be able to get to this position where we can support the right of those who have a pet, and can progress this bill accordingly.

Mr WINTER - Chair, I rise again to outline that Labor will be supporting the bill. Obviously it's very important. This is a reform that to so many Tasmanians have been waiting for, for a very long period of time. We're almost there. We're looking forward to the successful progression of the bill and the ability for more Tasmanians to be able to live with their pets in their rentals.

Mr BAYLEY - Chair, I will be quick. I will stay here in my spot. I indicate that we do support these amendments. I want to acknowledge that in the lead-up to this debate on this bill, I did receive emails from constituents concerned about the conservation values and concerned about the impact of pets in relation to their properties where they cherish the natural values.

I thank the member for Nelson, the honourable Meg Webb, for putting this amendment forward and having it passed in the upper House. I think the amendment improves the bill and it does make sure that those natural values that people have taken active steps to see protected are actually protected via the bill. It still gives tenant's rights, but it does obviously deliver good protection for those conservation areas. 

Noting that both funding in the Budget and it seems commitment is that conservation covenants are being progressed at a pretty slow pace at the moment, and are being used as a substitute for proper protection on publicly owned land. Nonetheless, those existing covenants are important and these amendments deliver some balance.

I have to put on the record as well though, that there is so much more that government can do when it comes to pets and when it comes to wildlife and conservation values. Things like the long-awaited Cat Management Plan 2024-29 has still not been delivered, despite the fact that it's 2025. There are activities and actions that government can take to protect conservation values from domestic animals. 

In saying that, we support these amendments. They improve the bill. This is one small step in giving renters additional rights. We do know that renters need further rights enshrined, including the ability to make minor modifications to their properties; including rental controls; including ending no-cause evictions; and of course, there's other things that government can do in that housing space. With that, we support these amendments and support the bill.

Mr BARNETT - Chair, in summing up, I wanted to pass on my sincere thanks to all the members of this House for the collaboration that they provided and for the feedback they provided with respect to the progress of this bill. It did get lots of discussion during the election campaign and subsequent to that. It is essentially the right for a person and a family to have their pet and to continue with that as they move residence, into that accommodation or a rental facility. Renters should not have to choose between having a place to live and the pet that they love. 

It should be noted there are similar laws in some other jurisdictions, but I think Tasmania is in the right place to progress with this legislation. It's something that we committed at the election. We've progressed with that and to receive the support across the Chambers is greatly appreciated. It's a collaborative approach. I thank the House for the opportunity and commend the amendment and the bill to the House.

Council amendments agreed to. 

Reported the Committee had resolved to agree to the Council amendments. 

Resolution agreed to. 


ADJOURNMENT
[7.16 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House do now adjourn. 


Answer to Question - Cubic Transportation Systems

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, in response to a question taken on notice by minister Vincent, asked by independent member for Franklin, David O'Byrne, I can advise as follows:

The State Growth annual report identifies a contract awarded to Cubic Transportation Systems for the common ticketing solution. The total contract is $65 million made up of $30.5 million, including GST, to design and build the ticketing solution and operate it until June 2028; $37.3 million, excluding GST, for optional contract extensions for operation beyond June 2028. 


Comments made by the Leader of the Opposition

[7.17 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to respond to comments that the honourable Mr Willie, Leader of the Opposition, made in this place during my budget reply speech earlier today. He took issue with the following statement I made:

The Leader of the Opposition has said time and again since Labor backflipped on its opposition to a stadium, they'll give the stadium unconditional support and back it whatever the cost. [TBC]

I was asked to withdraw but I rise to provide the facts that speak for themselves. 

At a press conference Mr Willie held on 2 April this year, he was asked by Elliot from WIN News:

When you say he, the premier, needs to come to parliament, are you saying that they need to correct some of the challenges that have been outlined by the Planning Commission to retain Labor support?

Mr Willie said:

No, we will support a stadium through the parliament because that is what is required to deliver these teams. 

David Killick from the Mercury asked:

There are problems, they need to fix the problems, but if they don't fix the problems, Labor's still going to vote for the stadium. That's the decision?

Mr Willie said:

Yes, we will be supporting the stadium through the parliament. There's no question about that. 

David Killick from the Mercury also asked:

So, the stadium is more important than good governance. It's more important than not running up a massive debt. It's more important than the environmental restrictions, than the traffic problems. There's nothing that can happen with this project that can go wrong that will cause you to waver in your support for it?

Mr Willie said:

I've said in the past, good governance matters whether you support the stadium or you don't. Good governance matters. We can't build this project for premier Rockliff from opposition. His track record in terms of Devonport is on the public record and Tasmanians have been disappointed by that. We need to see him do better. We need to see him come to parliament and explain how he's going to deliver on his promises for Tasmanians and how he's going to address some of the concerns of the Planning Commission, but we will support the stadium through the parliament.

Honourable Speaker, Labor's support was reported throughout media outlets then and since as unconditional and as a blank cheque for the stadium because it is.

It was honestly hard to listen to Mr Willie struggle through that train wreck interview, but the message from him was very clear throughout: Labor's support for the stadium is unconditional. It's something of a Tasmanian Labor tradition that there were some wobbles they had during the election where, for a few days, Tasmanians weren't exactly clear where they stood, but soon enough they reiterated their unconditional support for the stadium, reassuring voters that for the most unpopular project of a generation, Labor held exactly the same position as the government. 

We hoped there was a chance to change with the change of leader, but after Mr Willie muscled his way into being Opposition Leader, against the will of most of his colleagues, I might add, he reiterated that support. Today, we have Mr Willie trying to pretend that Labor has not offered unconditional support while, at the same time, making it clear that they will be voting for the project, no matter what. It makes my head spin. 

Mr Willie accused me of making things up when he's the one who's doing it. Mr Willie was continuing his dishonesty on ABC Mornings recently. On 21 October he said, 'The Greens have been a hard no the whole time, and their vote hasn't improved either.' In fact, that's completely false. The Greens vote did go up at the last election. It grew statewide and it grew significantly in four out of five electorates. The only place it didn't was in my own seat of Franklin, where all the election analysts have agreed the arrival of a new high-profile, high-spending, anti-stadium Independent put a dent in our vote. In fact, the Greens are the only party that has seen our vote grow at both the 2024 and the 2025 elections - elections where the stadium has been an issue.

It is Mr Willie who needs to get his facts straight. The Opposition Leader took offence this morning at the truth, when what is offensive is the truth that Labor is backing this stadium and its budget black hole no matter what. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition: if I am wrong, stand up here today and give us one single issue that would stop Labor supporting the stadium. Tell us what a spending cap would be for you. If you can't, Mr Willie, or if you won't, maybe it's time you gave up time-wasting points of order and your faux concern.


RACGP Tasmanian Fellowship and Awards

[7.22 p.m.]
Mrs ARCHER (Bass - Minister for Health, Mental Health and Wellbeing) - Honourable Speaker, I recently had the pleasure of attending the RACGP Tasmanian Fellowship and Awards ceremony, and welcoming Tasmania's newest general practitioners. The RACGP Tasmania Fellowship Ceremony is a special opportunity to recognise the next generation of general practitioners who will provide essential primary care to Tasmanians.

I congratulate all the new Fellows on this milestone achievement, which represents more than a decade of study, training and commitment to community care. GPs are the backbone of Tasmania's health system and these new Fellows will play a vital role in supporting the health and wellbeing of Tasmanians right across our state.

I note that among the new newly recognised Fellows were five rural generalists - GPs who undertake additional rural skills training in fields vital to regional and remote communities, such as anaesthesia and obstetrics. I also congratulate this year's award winners: 

GP of the Year: Dr Rosemary Ramsey 

GP Supervisor of the Year: Dr Boris Tan 

GP in Training of the Year: Dr Luke Heathcote 

General Practice of the Year: Summerdale Medical 

Dr Taylor Smith, Dr Grace Sterns and Dr Elizabeth Ofringer received Tasmanian Faculty Examination Medals in recognition of achieving the highest score across all three examinations on their path to fellowship 

Dr Alicia Scarfe received the Rural Medical Student of the Year award, and four Fellows were awarded life membership with the college.

A highlight for me was two generations of the Mooney family being recognised, with husband and wife, Dr Louise Phillips and Dr Tim Mooney, both receiving life memberships and their daughter, Dr Caroline Mooney joining her father as they both received their Rural Generalist Fellowship. 

Another highlight was Dr Lizzie Elliott delivering the inaugural Professor Peter Mudge Oration. Prof Mudge not only held the position of Chair of the RACGP Council for seven years, but he also received the Rose Hunt Medal, the college's most prestigious honour, for his significant contribution to the organisation.

In closing, it was an absolute honour to attend this ceremony. I can tell you that, thanks to the commitment of these wonderful healthcare professionals and the support of the RACGP, the future of general practice in Tasmania is looking very bright.


Development Assessment Panels - Reintroduction

[7.25 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, well, here we go again. We are back in DAPs, to borrow from an Amy Winehouse song title, and reintroducing the development assessment panels, which is a disappointing and cynical, questionable use of parliamentary time, in my opinion, and I am not alone in that position. Unfortunately, minister Kerry Vincent's media release on the introduction of development assessment panels' latest round of consultation was titled 'Taking the Politics Out of Planning'. This was the exact same phrase that minister Felix Ellis kept using when he tried, and failed, to convince not only those people interested in good planning outcomes for the places they love and know intimately across Tasmania but also this parliament, which roundly rejected the Ellis meddling in planning.

Even though Mr Vincent says he has listened to concerns and removed the minister's role in referring development assessments to a panel, it sounds a bit like putting lipstick on a pig, if you will. Minister, this lacks all credibility, which is a big setback with your good reputation as a can-do minister. 

Who is actually driving this third push for development assessment panels? We could hazard a guess, but it is pretty clear that someone wants the new planning minister to deliver for them. One of the key issues that people raised with us was the removal of the right to appeal, and it doesn't look like this has been addressed at all. Perhaps instead of consulting the public on this over and over - it's extremely clear that local governments, planning stakeholders and community members alike reject this proposal - could the government tell us what problem they think DAPs will solve? What is the point of consulting the public, receiving overwhelming opposition, making minor tweaks and trying yet again? I quote from one person, Dave, already primed to oppose the DAPs round 3. Dave says:

I am disappointed to have to write to you all again and have to point out things about this legislation which will still concern me, as it should all of you. The 2025 revised legislation has not significantly changed from the 2024 version that was refused by the parliament and retains all the key flaws.

Research demonstrates DAPs are pro-development and pro-government. DAPs will make it easier to approve large-scale contentious developments, like Kunanyi-Mount Wellington cable car, high-rises in Hobart, Cambria Green, and high-density subdivisions like Skylands and Droughty Point. I could go on.

In summary, the reintroduction of the DAPs for the third time is a cynical exercise. It really does feel that it's beneath Mr Vincent. I'm sure he will hear, very loudly and clearly, from our former local government colleagues and those who love and know this island: yet again, scrap the introduction of DAPs.


Mental Health Services for Police - Funding

[7.28 p.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, tonight on the adjournment I rise to read into the Hansard and speak a little about a motion that was successfully passed in our last parliament.

It was put forward by Andrew Jenner, and it was to do with mental health wellbeing considerations for former Tasmania Police members. I was quite annoyed that there was no funding for that in this Budget. I will read into the Hansard the letter that was sent from David Plumpton and John Mikulski from the Retired Police Association of Tasmania. It states:[tbc]

Whilst the Retired Police Association represents a significant number of former police officers, currently 560, our mental health and wellbeing program relates to all members, or more specifically, those who may be suffering mental health issues arising from or associated with, their former police service, and for whom there is no ongoing support from Tasmania Police or insurers. Accordingly, the RPAT reaches out to over 1000 ex police officers.

Given the police service history of our members and their age, we identify significant mental health, potential suicide and wellbeing risks with our members. Many of our members carry over mental health issues arising from exposure to significant traumatic policing events/incidents, whilst other members experience the accumulative effect from the exposure to events/ incidents over the course of their entire career. Some of these mental health issues manifest themselves while the member was still a serving police officer, and they were able to receive departmental assistance and professional mental health care support in managing these issues. 

However, many instances of mental health issues do not manifest themselves until after the RPAT member has retired or resigned and departmental support is no longer an option. These incidents can arise from PTSD or an accumulation of incidents over their career. 

In some instances, separation from Tasmania Police can itself be the trigger to initiate mental health, suicide potential, and wellbeing issues. Tasmania Police does not provide any professional services or resources to RPAT members who, as former members of Tasmania Police, are now experiencing mental health, potential suicide, and wellbeing issues, many of which were initiated during their service with Tasmania Police. 

The Retired Police Association subscribes to the theory 'They broke them, they should fix them' - 'they' being Tasmania Police.  [TBC]

That letter was written in April 2025. On Wednesday, 12 March 2025 in the Tasmanian Parliament, the parliament supported that motion put forward by Andrew Jenner MP, and it was supported by Kristie Johnston MP. The Labor Party supported the motion. I believe the Greens supported the motion. The Liberals didn't support the motion. However, the motion was passed, but the funding hasn't been forthcoming in this Budget, and we believe that it is a deficiency. There was an agreement by this place to accept that motion and to provide that funding and that support for retired police officers. 

I believe the saying from RPAT, 'they broke them, they must fix them', is really important. We must make sure that our serving police officers also understand that when they reach an age where they want to retire and they're seeking those support services, that they will also be there. That would also be quite an incentive for existing police officers to know that they will have that support in retirement. We will keep campaigning. 

I thank Mr Jenner for his work in that. I also thank the Retired Police Association for reaching out and contacting me about the deficiency in the Budget. We implore the minister to find the money to ensure that our retired police officers are adequately supported.


Budget Submission Process for 2026-27 Budget

[7.33 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, before I begin, I seek leave to table a document on behalf of Dr Rosalie Woodruff. The document has already been circulated.

Leave granted.

Ms ROSOL - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak this evening about the current budget submission process the government is conducting for the 2026-27 Budget. We have just had two days of debate about the interim Budget for 2025-26. A repeated theme has been the coming cuts, signalled by the Treasurer's own words, where he has said he will be cutting 2800 jobs. 

Then there are the many budget lines for services that just peter out into blanks or fall off a cliff into nothingness. They, too, are cuts. However, there is another clear signal of the government's plan to cut funding, this time in community service sectors. The signal is in the pre-budget consultation form, which has been sent to community organisations as part of the budget submissions process. The form asks organisations to respond to five questions:

(1)	Which programs or projects could be refocused to deliver core outcomes with more streamlined resources or refined focus?

(2)	Are there initiatives or investments that could be reconsidered, helping balance the budget now without losing sight of long-term goals?

(3)	Are there programs or services that could be transitioned out as the needs of Tasmanians evolve and priorities shift?

(4)	Where could government activities be recalibrated to operate more effectively while still meeting essential needs?

(5)	For any new funding ideas, what savings or offsets could be identified elsewhere to ensure the overall budget remains balanced?

Multiple community services organisations have raised concerns with me about the approach taken by the government in this round of budget submissions and with these questions. They have read clearly what the government is saying between the lines and see these questions as all being focused on finding cuts for the government so they can save money. One organisation paraphrased the questions for me this way:

(1)	What programs can you cut back on?

(2)	What programs can you cut out altogether?

(3)	What programs should be cut to cover the cost of any new programs?

Organisations have noticed this year's process is a departure from the approach taken in previous years, including for the 2025-26 Budget.

There is a distinct change in tone and approach. Previous years took a consultative approach, inviting organisers to share about the context of their service and their ideas for improvements the government could make. It welcomed the sharing of options for how to fund services and sort opinions about government charges and taxes. It took a big-picture approach that tapped into the wealth of experience and knowledge that is held within community service organisations. Not this year. This year the government have cut straight to the chase. 'Tell us what to cut,' they say, 'and don't bother with anything else, we're not interested.' Or, in the words of someone in the community service sector:

The focus has shifted from consultation for understanding, to consultation for fiscal improvements and trade-offs. We are deeply concerned that we may see a reduction in funding across our sector as the government seeks to address the budget deficit.

I have heard the shock, distress and anxiety felt by organisations who are working so hard with already tight budgets to meet ever growing levels of need. The government's approach is disrespectful and cold. Community service organisations are the smiling face, the warm handshake, the caring heart, the soft place to land that people who are doing it tough, so desperately need. These organisations are the hands through which the government does their work in the community. To dismiss the value and essential nature of what they do, is to minimise and invalidate both the organisations and the many Tasmanians they support.

We have a debt problem, but it's not the fault of Tasmanians and it's not the fault of community organisations who, quite frankly, work miracles for people with very little funding. It's completely unacceptable for the government to turn community service organisations into the budget fall guys, crashing down on them, and crushing them and the people who rely on them. The government must do better.

I still have 22 seconds, haven't I? They could start by looking at the corporate welfare they so like to sprinkle around and find savings there, that won't result in the neediest in Tasmania missing out. It's unacceptable for Tasmanians to pay the cost of the folly of the stadium that will drag the state into deeper and deeper debt. The government must do better.


National Survivors' Day
 [Bookmark: _Hlk213872973] 
[7.38 p.m.]
Ms BROWN (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I will take this opportunity to withdraw one of my comments that I made earlier. 

I rise on the Adjournment this evening, to speak on a matter of profound state and indeed, national importance, National Survivors' Day. Today is not a celebration, it is a day of recognition and awareness. It is a time to pause and acknowledge the lifelong harm caused by sexual assault and institutional abuse, and to pay tribute to those extraordinary people who survive this every day, to their loved ones, and to the services that work tirelessly to support them. National Survivors' Day is an opportunity for us, as members of this place representing our communities, to recommit that we will not allow this silence to continue. It is the voices of those who have endured these unspeakable horrors. It is the voices of those who have spoken up in a heroic act of defiance against those who aim to break them. It is the voices of those who are surviving in this world, where they deserve to thrive.

By listening - genuinely listening - we help to break down the stigma and ensure that no survivor feels like they will not be believed. Recognition is essential, but it is only the first step. True honouring of a survivor's journey requires action. We must learn from the past. We must continue to strengthen prevention, improve support, and ensure survivors are working within a system that is built to support them. We must do better to break down the barriers by working directly with survivors and advocates to fix the systemic failures that prevent healing and recovery.

Today, every day, and as we lead into the 16 days of activism, let those of us in this place renew our commitment to shaping a society where everybody is safe, where every story is met with compassion, and where every survivor is given the resources they need to heal and thrive. Most importantly, let's work together to create a Tasmania that sends a clear message that we will not let these horrific stories become someone's reality. I say to every survivor, your resilience is truly inspiring. I stand with you and the Tasmanian Labor Party stands with you.


Chronic Pain and Medicinal Cannabis

[7.41 p.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about chronic pain and medicinal cannabis. A few months ago, I spoke in this place about persistent and chronic pain and the role of medicinal cannabis. I invited pain sufferers to share their experiences and I have been overwhelmed by the generosity of people who have got in touch to tell me about the daily difficulties they face and how helpful medicinal cannabis has been for them. I did so because I wanted to start a public conversation about this topic. In continuing on that journey, I want to share with you one person's experience. This is from Mark:

Unfortunately, I have suffered from chronic, severe pain for most of my life, since I was 17. I am now 53. Initially, I was diagnosed with RSD, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy, which was and has now been changed to CRPS, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. Subsequently I am on a disability pension.

I've had multiple surgeries, tried an incredible cornucopia of medications, years and years of tests, et cetera, et cetera. It is a very long story that I won't bore you with. Anyway, through all of that, the only things that I found that actually work and make a difference are opiates, alcohol, and cannabis. I have to be very careful with opiates and alcohol, of course, so that I do not become dependent nor damage my health too much, plus opiates specifically, for me, only really work by making me pass out and basically becoming a vegetable, which is no way to live and I seriously dislike the way opiates make me feel. I now totally avoid opiates and have avoided them for a long time.

So, cannabis is the better one for me personally. For many, many years, I obtained illegal cannabis which is very inconsistent in availability, price and efficacy and, of course, it was illegal so I could have gotten myself into trouble with the law at any time - just extra stress that I don't need on top of my pain, but, certainly better than the severe pain, so worth the risk in my humble opinion.

Relatively recently, early last year in fact, I was able to get onto a trial of medical cannabis gummies and it is truly life changing. They do not prevent all of my pain, nothing does, but they do a pretty darn good job with the added benefit of me still actually being able to function. The only problem is that they are so darn expensive that I can rarely afford to fill a single prescription. For me, a single prescription costs $300 and will last for two weeks at the prescribed dosage. If I stretch them out by only having one gummy when my pain is at its worst, I can make one prescription last for about a month, but that means more pain, of course.

So, on the disability pension, at $500 a week, with all of the other things that I need to pay for, predominantly a roof over my head, utility bills and food, I am able to afford one prescription every four to five months, if I am lucky. Sometimes maybe once or twice a year, I go without some food, so that I can afford an extra prescription and therefore enjoy some extra time with less pain.

Less pain and somewhat hungry is sometimes a good trade-off, but I usually get hungry enough to regret it. Anyway, there's my story, it may be useful to you. I am not complaining, really. I totally understand how lucky I am to live in a country in which a disability pension is actually available to me, let alone lucky enough to be able to be on a medical cannabis trial. It would, however, be really great if I could afford enough medication so that my constant pain can be lessened more often.

To the person who shared this story and everyone else who has talked about their daily pain and the challenges they face in managing that pain, thank you. Please keep the stories coming. They keep the conversation going and they build the case for change.

I've personally sponsored a petition that calls for the establishment of a parliamentary committee to review how cannabis is regulated in Tasmania. The petition has only been open for a month, but it has already attracted over 1000 signatures. I encourage those who want to see change in the way we regulate cannabis and medicinal cannabis to sign the petition. Thank you.


Online Access Centres - Transition

[7.46 p.m.]
Mr SHELTON (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to acknowledge the enormous contribution of online access centres and, in particular, those volunteers who've made Tasmanian communities and worked for Tasmanian communities over decades. Many of these centres have been proudly maintained by dedicated locals since the late 1990s and I thank every volunteer who has given their time to support these operations.

Our government believes that digital inclusion is essential. It affects how Tasmanians work, learn, connect, access services, and participate in modern life, particularly in rural and regional communities where there can be limited options. Today's digital inclusion services are delivered through 15 independent community managed online access centres funded through the digital connection grants and through 46 Libraries Tasmania sites across the state.

It's impossible to ignore the fact that the digital landscape has changed dramatically over the past 25 years. Many online access centres have closed because the communities can no longer sustain the volunteer-run model. In 1998, there were 65 online access centres. Now, there are 15.

The 2024 Digital Inclusion review identified major sustainability challenges and, while the review recommended moving away from the OAC (online access centres) model entirely, the government does not - I repeat - does not support this approach. Indeed, we are taking a practical community-by-community approach. In four locations, digital inclusion services will transition to the local library where it makes sense to do so and there is a clear duplication of services. This is about providing sustainable modern services, not removing access.

These changes will not result in any Tasmanian community losing digital-inclusion support. In fact, the transition to library-based services means these communities will gain better access through longer opening hours. For example, at New Norfolk, the library is open 43 hours per week compared with the online access centre's 20 hours. All the services that are currently provided by the online access centre will be provided over a greater span of operating hours.

I'm advised that Libraries Tasmania has expressed a willingness to work with the Derwent Online Access Centre to redesign the library space so it best meets the digital inclusions needs of the local community. Positions have been offered within the digital volunteer program to any volunteers at online access centres.

I also want to correct the claim made by the member for Lyons, Jen Butler, last week. She suggested library staff can't pick up a phone or a device. That is not correct. Of course, they can touch people's devices and help them out. Where she is getting confused, perhaps, is with the Libraries Tasmania's digital inclusion guidelines, which appropriately prevent staff from actions such as directly logging into people's banking or other secured accounts. That safeguard is entirely reasonable and protects both staff and community members.

We accept change can sometimes be difficult. That's why the digital connection grants have been extended until June 2026 to allow for a more detailed discussion with individual online access centres and to provide surety to employment for online access centre coordinators during this period. No centre will be left without a pathway forward.

Our approach is simple: to do what is best for each local community and our commitment is unwavering to ensure Tasmanians, no matter where they live, have access to contemporary and sustainable digital inclusion services.


Karen Harrland - Tribute

[7.50 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight with a heavy ongoing sadness to pay tribute to an established star in Tasmania's literary lineup and a stellar, beautiful person in both the local primary school community and my own close circle of friends. 

Karen Harrland is many things to many people: an author, teacher, mother, partner and dear friend to countless talented, down to earth and treasured people.

Karen drowned in the Franklin River on 2 November, five days into the trip of a lifetime with her partner Al and a group of friends. The dignity of risk is the willingness and ability to undertake activities inherent with hazards, but supported by skills and planning. Karen and Al's trip down the Franklin was well prepared and, in the wake of the tragedy, police lauded the preparedness and experience of the group and the guides. Circumstance simply conspired for the river to take her and rescue to be delayed such that CPR could not sustain her until help arrived the next morning. Such is the cruelty of that circumstance.

The bitter loss is only tempered minutely by the knowledge that Karen was doing something she loved, with people she loved, in a place so spectacularly wild and beautiful it was almost meant to be, but how could it? With a legacy larger than most double her age and with so much more to give, the loss of Karen leaves a chasm in the lives of all who knew her. No more so than in Al and her children, Asher, Clay and Xavier.

After coming off the river following the exhilaration, immersion, trauma, then tragedy, Al wrote in his first message to his community, I quote:

Karen and I focused on teaching our children to be resilient, to change and today was an incredible testament to that.

How impressive that resilience has been. Supported by this community, Al has wrapped his arms around his family and doggedly defended the space they need to grieve and survive. Al is the strongest and most capable man that I know and so they will survive and, in time, thrive. 

Karen grew up in the Adelaide Hills and came to Tasmania to see our wilds and the adventures they provide. She soon met Al and they began to settle, buying a block of land on the southern slopes of Kunanyi and beginning to establish a life and community together.

Interrupted by sojourns to outback Australia to manage remote conservation properties, Karen and Al systematically built a family, careers and a spectacular home at Neika. Unexpectedly falling pregnant with Asher in remote outback Queensland, the experience of pregnancy and young motherhood in the Simpson Desert sands prompted Karen's first book Spinifex Baby, a personal reflection on the challenges that came, not with the 45°C heat and the incessant flies, but with the deepest fears that resided within themselves.

Spinifex Baby won the 2014 Finch Memorial Prize open to unpublished non-fiction memoirs. A prolific writer, Karen maintained a blog, capturing heartfelt moments in everyday life and the extraordinary things she did with people seemingly every day. The success of Spinfex Baby helped promote her second published work in 2022, Daughter of the Plateau, a fictional tale of young girl, Manna, growing up on the harsh Tasmanian central plateau with no mother and a cold distant father. Writing of the significance of nature, the book was described as a love letter to Tasmania's immense landscapes and powerful coasts. Nature anchored Karen on so many levels.

As a teacher, she created confidence and connections through program-based pedagogy in the garden, in the classroom and through story circles. Inspired by oral traditions used by Indigenous and other people of the world over, bonding with their students and empowering them to embrace language and learning came easier in the outdoors, in a circle and with a generous offer to engage on their own terms.

Former Margate Primary principal, Kate Slater, summed up Karen's centrality and success, and I quote:

Karen was the golden thread that connected us. From her heart to others, to nature and then to herself. She was our teacher, mentor and coach.

Karen was loved as a central axis around whom so many good things moved, with grace, value, love and success. So, Karen was well celebrated. Three weekends ago, hundreds gathered on the beach at her home in Coningham to honour and remember all that Karen meant and made. Based around themes including outdoors, nature, poetry, lanterns, music, colour and community, the celebration was a special and apt farewell for someone who touched and will forever sit within the hearts of so many. 

My love and strength is with Al and the kids for their journey to come. Vale, Karen. Thank you for the gifts that will keep giving and the presence and positivity you brought to this world.
Victim/Survivors' Day

[7.55 p.m.]
Mrs GREENE (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, today, on victim/survivors' day, we honour the courage and resilience of those who have endured sexual abuse. This day is not only about remembrance, it's about recognition, accountability and action. It's about saying to every survivor 'We see you, we hear you, and we will not stop fighting for change'. Sexual abuse leave scars that are often invisible, but they are lifelong. Survivors carry the weight of trauma, yet they also carry extraordinary strength. Their stories remind us that silence is never an option and that justice must be more than a word. It must be lived in our institutions, our communities and our daily actions.

In Tasmania, we are fortunate to have organisations that stand beside survivors every single day. Laurel House and Sexual Assault Support Service (SASS) are lifelines. They provide counselling, advocacy and safe spaces where survivors can begin to heal. Their work is a reminder that compassion and professional support can transform lives. However, they cannot do it alone; they need us, they need government, community and individuals to stand with them, to resource them, and to amplify their mission.

I acknowledge the investment to Laurel House and SASS announced in recent days by the federal Labor ministers, the honourable Michelle Rowland MP, the honourable Tanya Plibersek, and the member for Bass, Jess Teesdale. They've committed over $551,000 to Laurel House to expand their crucial work of responding to victim survivors of child sexual abuse, and children who are displaying harmful sexual behaviours. That funding is very welcome news and I know that there are many friends in the Chamber here tonight, of Laurel House and SASS.

Through the commission of inquiry, as a state we have started to confront the uncomfortable truth: that our systems have not always protected the most vulnerable. Ashley Youth Detention Centre has been a stark example of how we have failed young people in care. The commission of inquiry laid bare the devastating consequences of neglect, silence and systemic failure. The commission has described hearing evidence from children in youth detention as 'harrowing', with abuses that were callous, cruel and degrading. Yet, instead of embracing transformational reform, the proposed Pontville Youth Justice Facility risks making the same mistakes.

As outlined in the joint statement called 'From Harm to Healing', this facility is not fit for purpose. Its location near rifle ranges and a marijuana cultivation site exposes children to environmental triggers that can re-traumatise, rather than heal. Its distance from families and communities to make meaningful connection is going to be almost impossible. Its design risks creating another closed, isolating institution - another Ashley - rather than a therapeutic child centred model of care.

That is why 15 organisations have united to demand better: Together, Anglicare Tasmania, Gender Equality, Jordan River Service Inc, Jesuit Social Services, Night Lamp Psychology and Consulting, Laurel House, Prisoners' Legal Service of Tasmania, The Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service, The Tasmanian Family and Sexual Violence Alliance, Women's Legal Services Tasmania, Yemaya Women's Support Service, The Youth Network of Tasmania, Women's Health Tasmania, the Australian Lawyers Alliance, and the Tasmanian OPCAT Network, have all spoken with one voice. They remind us that detention is not the only answer, and have made a number of recommendations. I really encourage you all here to read that document.

Victim/survivor's day is not just another date on the calendar, it is a call to action. It's a reminder that behind every statistic is a person: a daughter, a son, a friend, a neighbour whose life has been forever changed. We owe it to them to build a Tasmania where safety, dignity and justice are not privileges, but rights.

Let us honour survivors, not only with our words, but with deeds. Let us stand with the 15 organisations who have said clearly 'We must do better'. It's not too late. Survivors deserve more than our sympathy. They deserve our solidarity, our accountability and our unwavering commitment to change.

The House adjourned at 8.00 p.m.
